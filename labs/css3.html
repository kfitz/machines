<h1>CSS Lab, page 3</h1>

<h2>Basic CSS</h2>

<p>Like HTML files, CSS files are plain text, editable in any text editor.  (As I attempted to show you last week, I like TextWrangler, because of the way it formats your code, making your tags visible.)  A CSS file is always saved with the file extension ".css".</p>

<p>Here's the basic format of CSS code:</p>

<blockquote><code>p {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br />
}</code></blockquote>

<p>This instructs your browser to make all text contained within &lt;p&gt; tags in any page linked to this stylesheet red.</p>


<h2>CSS Structure</h2>

<p>Note the structure of the CSS entry above.  It begins with "p", which is the tag whose output you want to define, followed by an open curly bracket.  The entry also ends with a close curly bracket.  The brackets are absolutely required, as they tell the system that everything inbetween belongs to "p".</p>

<p>Inbetween the curly brackets, you list the properties you want to define, and the values for each of those properties, in this form:</p>

<p><code>property: value;</code></p>

<p>Properties include, as in our example above, things like color; there are also properties for setting the font that your text uses, the size of the font, the spacing around the text, and many other things besides.</p>

<p>Note that the property name must be followed by a colon, and that each value must be followed by a semi-colon.  You can use multiple properties to control multiple aspects of your tags, like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>p {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 14px;<br />
}</code></blockquote>

<p>Now let's look at what style1.css contains.</p>

<p><a href="css4.html">Go to the next page.</a></p>

<p><a href="css1.html">Go back to the beginning.</a></p>

<p><a href="index.html">labs home</a><br />
<a href="index.html">machines home</a></p>
