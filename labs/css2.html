<h1>CSS Lab, page 2</h1>

<h2>Section 1.</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>Here is another one.</p>

<h2>Section 2.</h2>
<p>I'm going to add a few more.</p>
<p>Why not one more?</p>

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>If you look at the source code for this page, you'll see that the basic html for the sections above is exactly the same as for the previous page: same h1, h2, and p tags, with no new information in the markup.  The only change is the addition of this line to the "head" section of the page:</p>

<p><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css" type="text/css" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>This line causes the page to link to a stylesheet, contained within the same folder as the page, called "style1.css".  That stylesheet contains information about how the results of various tags should look in your browser.</p>

<p>So what does this style1.css file look like?</p>

<p><a href="css3.html">Go to the next page.</a></p>

<p><a href="css1.html">Go back to the beginning.</a></p>

<p><a href="index.html">labs home</a><br />
<a href="index.html">machines home</a></p>
