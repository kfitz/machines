<h1>CSS Lab, page 1</h1>

<p>You may remember this from last week's workshop.</p>

<h2>Section 1.</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>Here is another one.</p>

<h2>Section 2.</h2>
<p>I'm going to add a few more.</p>
<p>Why not one more?</p>

<h2>What's New?</h2>

<p>Everything above is written in XHTML, which (as you might guess) bears a lot in common with HTML, but is designed to be more compatible with future technologies.  Last week, I insisted that it was "good practice" in HTML to close all of your tags; in fact, closing your tags is required in XHTML, which is part of why I wanted you to get used to it.</p>

<p>The main thing that's new on this page (aside from these paragraphs down here) is a DOCTYPE declaration, before the opening &lt;html&gt; tag, which tells your browser what standards the page is following.  The DOCTYPE declaration looks like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" <br />
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;</code></p>

<p>One of the primary principles of XHTML is that the code you write within this page shouldn't attempt to control the way the page looks -- its design -- but should just convey information about the kinds of information contained on the page:  headers, subheads, paragraphs, lists, etc.</p>

<p>So how do you make the page <i>look</i> the way you want it to?</p>
