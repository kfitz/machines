<h2><p>Character-Level Formatting</p></h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll want to put text in <i>italics</i>, sometimes you'll want to put it in <b>bold</b>, and sometimes you'll want to <u>underline</u> something.</p>
<p>Of course, you could <i><b><u>do all three at once</u></b></i>, but I wouldn't recommend it.</p>
<p>You can also affect the formatting of text by choosing to <em>emphasize</em> it, or to make it <strong>strong</strong>.  Some systems (like our blog commenting system) will only allow you to use emphasis or strong (?), for reasons that have to do with designer control over what a page looks like.  As you'll be building your own pages, you don't have to worry about that.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links can send you to <a href="http://www.pomona.edu" title="Pomona homepage">another page</a>, or they can send you to <a href="#anchor" title="anchor">another place on the same page</a>.</p>
<p>The second kind of link uses what's known as an <i>anchor</i>.  You can combine the two forms of link by linking to an anchor on another page.</p>

<a name="anchor"><h2>Images</h2></a>
<p>You can also embed images in your html pages.  For instance, here's a lovely picture of the Pomona logo:
	
<p><a href="http://www.pomona.edu"><img src="pomona.jpg" alt="Pomona logo" /></a></p>

<p>Note that the logo is also a link.</p>
