<h1>bad web design contest</h1>

<p>For today's lab, I want you, first, to read through the resources on DARPA's <a href="http://darpa.pomona.edu/tutorials/bad-webpages/">guide to making bad web pages</a>.</p>

<p>Then I want you, using XHTML and CSS, to make a really, really bad webpage.</p>

<p>Really.</p>

<p>In addition to simply <i>being</i> badly designed, the content on your page should explain what makes the page so bad.</p>

<p>You have until Monday morning before class to post this XHTML page (name the file "badwebpage.html") and your CSS file (named "bad.css") in your MyWebs space.</p>

<p>The worst page, as determined by a non-independent body of judges (i.e., me) will receive a one-half grade bump (i.e, from B+ to A-) to be applied to the grade of the assignment of your choice.</p>

<p>Get to work!  Jason's there if you have questions, but please try to use the resources at your disposal (i.e., the resources linked on the labs home page, and your friend Google) to answer any questions yourself first.</p>

<p>See you Monday.</p>
