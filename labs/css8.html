<h1>CSS, Part 2</h1>

<h2>Get to Work!</h2>

<p>During the rest of today's lab, I want you to work on your website assignment, using XHTML and CSS.  In order to do this, you'll need to create two text documents, one for the page's XHTML-based content (using the file extension .html) and one for the page's stylesheet (using the file extension .css).</p>

<p>Remember that you'll need to include a line in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML page linking to your stylesheet, using something like this:</p>

<blockquote><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css" type="text/css" /&gt;</code></blockquote>

<p>Remember also that your HTML page should only define the kinds of information and the content rendered on the page, and that all of the information about the way the page looks goes into your CSS file.</p>

<p>You should feel free to borrow judiciously from the source code of these lab pages, or of other pages you like, but for the assignment I want you to make the design and content of your page your own.</p>

<p>Your website assignment will be assessed based on:</p>

<ul><li>The clarity of its communication and navigation structures.</li>
<li>The appealingness of its design.</li>
<li>The compellingness of its content.</li>
<li>The correctness of its code.</li></ul>

<p>As you work, explore the resources linked to on the labs front page, and make use of the <em>Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours</em> volume.  I'll be circulating if you have questions.</p>
