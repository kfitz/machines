 <title>Identity and Relationships in Pattern Recognition&#039;s Online Space</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/334</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought one of the most interesting bits of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; was the way people&#039;s online friendships worked out - what with Parkaboy/Cayce and Judy/Taki eventually hooking up in the real world based on affections that were developed almost exclusively through online chatting. Obviously, this stuff says a lot about how Gibson sees the world of 2002 and the relation of technology in it to human interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cayce&#039;s dealings in cyberspace mostly take the form of posts on a publicly-available bulletin board, though she also engages in email. But the way Cayce uses that bulletin board is fundamentally different from the way Case interacts with others online in Neuromancer. That&#039;s because of the nature of the medium. Cayce, like most denizens of the modern web, can&#039;t converse face-to-face with her bulletin-board friends: she doesn&#039;t video-chat, so she can&#039;t sense people&#039;s body language, and she doesn&#039;t even have much idea who most of the people are outside of their commentary on the footage. Even though people have begun to develop communities and human relationships in cyberspace, these relationships and communities consist mostly of exchanges of text. People&#039;s identities are easily obscured, but - in &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; â€“ the relationships they form are nonetheless legitimate and meaningful, often more powerful than predominantly in-person relationships. The deep friendship between Cayce and Parkaboy is the most prevalent example, but perhaps the most intriguing such relationship is between Judy and Taki. Originally, Musashi (Darryl) and Parkaboy are just using Judy as an image to weasel information out of Taki, but when she and Taki start actually talking with each other, &quot;She&#039;s mesmerized by the extent (she says the heartbreaking purity) of Taki&#039;s passion for her&quot; and begins to think &quot;that the love Taki has to offer her is the love she&#039;s waited for all her life&quot; despite &quot;the fact that she knews Taki things she&#039;s a petite Japanese college girl, and that Darryl is translating for her both ways&quot; (232). Gibson uses the book to comment that people are increasingly text-oriented, and the inability to prejudge people in the textual realm based on their race or appearance allows new kinds of relationships to exist, such as the love between Taki and Judy that subsists â€“ at least, initially â€“ on the basis of emotion and writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, that relationship seems to ultimately work out despite the problems it faces initially, as one of the final emails applauds &quot;her enthusiasm for the city (and her boyfriend!)&quot; in Tokyo (364-365). In the world of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt;, not only is it possible to fall in love with someone just by exchanging emails, and ultimately to meet the person in real life â€“ but those relationships seem better than the relationships characters otherwise end up in â€“ as evidenced by the way Cayce ends up with Parkaboy instead of Damien, who is still muddled in a difficult relationship with the daughter of the man funding his documentary project. The happy resolutions point towards a general optimism about humans&#039; ability to adapt to such a text-based culture - maybe even a belief that such a world is better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Reading Response Pass</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I suspected, there&#039;s no way I&#039;m producing a reading response today, between the draft of the final paper and a paper I have to write for another class... Ah well, I saved my second pass because I knew this would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The colors of Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/257</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I might take a look at the use of color in this novel. After all, the story has a lot of powerful imagery, and it was originally meant to be a &quot;computer-generated graphic novel&quot;, so the design of the imagery must have demanded a lot of attention. Even the title of the book, &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; is a term with some intrinsic color qualities. A snow crash displays &quot;white noise&quot;, &quot;a pattern of black-and-white pixels&quot; (73-74). The black-and-white of the snow crash is a very bad thing: it&#039;s associated with nonsense, an extremely primitive fault with a machine. If you see a snow crash, you&#039;ve witnessed a &quot;system crash... at such a fundamental level&quot; that the graphics output fails (42). It&#039;s both menacing and something to scoff at, a simple failure; a properly-protected computer shouldn&#039;t suffer a snow crash, but if it has been infected with a virus, it might. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also the black-and-white avatars, which tend to draw suspicion and distaste from everyone else. These are &quot;persons who are accessing the Metaverse through cheap public terminals... a lot of whom are run-of-the-mill psycho fans&quot; (41). The grainy black-and-white avatars represent a sort of lower class of Metaverse user, and that lower class apparently consists of generic yet obnoxious characters. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you took a hypercard from a black-and-white person,&quot; Hiro says to Da5id, implying that Da5id would have to be very stupid to do that. It implies that black-and-white people are dangerously unaccountable, and consequently something to distrust or scorn. This is pretty consistent with the black-and-white of the snow crash: in both cases, the grainy mixture of black and white is associated with something both mundane and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, black by itself, or rather, black &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; itself, is associated with power within the novel. The uniform Hiro wears when he is The Deliverator is &quot;black as activated charcoal&quot; (1), making him &quot;a grim vision in ninja black&quot; (5), and &quot;his car is an invisible black lozenge, just a dark place that reflects... the loglo&quot; (7). The equipment of the Deliverator is associated with efficiency, danger, and power. He is stealthy, very fast, and wields tools that are immensely powerful, and all of these tools are black. Similarly, the Metaverse&#039;s number one hacker hangout is &quot;a squat black pyramid&quot; with &quot;a matte black hemisphere... set in the front wall&quot; - &quot;THE BLACK SUN&quot; (39-40). It&#039;s another case of black-on-black, a combination that (unlike black-and-white) is associated with the few most powerful, most dangerous individuals in the Metaverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the colors of advertisements and other businesses. The Kourier service wears a combination of &quot;orange and blue&quot; (13), and the Enforcers uniform is an &quot;acid green uniform&quot; (122). Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong, one of the safest parts of town, is signified by &quot;a green-and-blue sign, soothing and calm in a glare-torn franchise ghetto&quot; (83). The various franchises, and their meaning to the main characters especially, are reflected in the colors they choose for their advertising. Green is security; blue is calm; and orange is flashy but still hip when combined with blue. On the contrary, &quot;cheap, nasty franchises all tend to adopt logos with a lot of bright, hideous yellow in them&quot; (145). These bright, ugly logos are like &quot;radioactive urine&quot;  (145) â€“ associated with the disgusting human waste, and probably something that would be dangerous to be exposed to. In other words, all kinds of bright colors are associated with different franchises, but the colors used tend to say something useful about that franchise. This view is both somewhat anticorporate (the distaste for certain franchises) and simultaneously rooted in the kind of psychology that corporate consumerism requires (the association of colors with brands, with the hope that brands can identify themselves as high-quality simply by choosing the right colors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even the colored uniform of of the couriers, &quot;fly as it may be&quot;, is not always advantageous (259). Even Y.T., who&#039;s normally a very brightly-colored person, between her blond hair and the Kourier uniform, resorts to becoming a &quot;black angel&quot; when it comes down to dangerous business (259). This is when the power-of-the-hackers black convention meets the bright-franchise-colors convention: when Y.T. is working for her franchise, she uses the colors, but when she wants power she reverts her clothing to black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So throughout the book, lots of colors have pretty strong associations. Black-and-white noise is cheap, mundane, yet dangerous; yellow is disgusting and unhealthy; green is security, and blue is placidity. And of course, though I haven&#039;t discussed it here, red is danger. These associations mostly hold pretty consistently throughout the novel, which both makes it powerful as a visual experience and acts as a subtle but defining feature of the corporately-defined system of &quot;government&quot; and lifestyle that is at the core of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Katerine the Corporate Monster</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/247</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicola Griffith&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Slow River&lt;/em&gt; is an acclaimed piece of science fiction, and insofar as it has realistic portrayals of the interactions between chemistry, biology, corporations, and the environment, it&#039;s a very successful book. But when it comes to the personal and family intrigue, the book has problems. Too many times, the characters&#039; motivations are in question, so the plausibility of the novel suffers. Katerine, especially, is a character whose actions are never fully explicated, who serves as a major antagonist without a cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first encounter Katerine as the one who resisted her husband&#039;s push to have their genes returned to normal. The gray hair is a way of &quot;saying to the world, look, I&#039;m so rich I can afford to have this expensive anticancer treatment&quot; and even though Oster thinks they should turn the gene back on, Katerine &quot;want[s] [Lore] to have all the visible trappings of the rich and powerful&quot; (52). It&#039;s not entirely clear why this is the case. In fact, it seems rather narrow-sighted, or selfish, for Katerine to do this, though plausible that she&#039;s doing it for the sake of her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the important scene where Lore wakes to &quot;the monster... breathing hot fire on her neck and groaning like a beast&quot; (68). Katerine in this scene makes a small effort at being comforting, but really she just seems to dismiss Lore&#039;s bothers, asking &quot;How could it have got in?&quot; and calling it &quot;Just a dream&quot; (68). We later discover that this is because Katerine herself is the &quot;monster&quot; and she must be trying to hide it. But we never find out why she does this. Presumably Katerine has some sort of perverse sexuality, but there&#039;s never a scene where she explains how she fought against it, or came to accept it, or how she developed it in the first place. Oster, in the same scene, is comforting and helpful. He &quot;takes her hand&quot; and tries to soothe her, offers to &quot;find a lock&quot; for her door immediately, while Katerine is heading off for some &quot;net conference&quot; the next morning (68-69). It is stated that Oster&#039;s actions, throughout the book, are motivated in part by competing with his wife for Lore&#039;s affection, but his behavior (unlike Katerine&#039;s) tends also to be the nurturing love of a parent, whereas Katerine seems caught up in the corporation all the time, and spurns family matters that don&#039;t interact with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is significant that Oster, not Katerine, is the one who &quot;is fond of saying&quot; that &quot;the company is not the same as the family&quot; (103). This is because, for Katerine, they are the same. When Katerine wants to spend family time with Lore, she &quot;scribbles some catalytic reaction equation on a napkin&quot; and sends &quot;case studies... over the net&quot; while her father &quot;suggests they go look for tree frogs&quot; or &quot;talks... about the new species of carp&quot; (108). Katerine seems focused on training her daughter to be the perfect member of the van der Oest business, not so much on letting her develop as an individual. Katerine&#039;s idea of family fun time is the same as school time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Katerine is totally consumed by her business, and placed in stark contrast with Oster, who barely involves himself in the family business, instead concentrating on whimsical pet projects; but when Lore has a difficult time, Katerine is the one at fault, and Oster is the one who supports her. This speaks to the problems of being so consumed by work that one loses everything else, and that is the only thing approaching an explanation for what makes Katerine a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Art, Culture, and Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/160</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oankali in &lt;em&gt;Lilith&#039;s Brood&lt;/em&gt; are distinctly alien, in many ways â€“ but the difference which persists longest and is most troublesome is their culture â€“ or apparent lack thereof. The Oankali apparently take the view that biology is everything â€“ that, given the scale of a group of humans throughout a lifetime, the genes they have within them ultimately decide the fate of the entires species. They believe that they can predict the lifestyle of the children their ooloi mix before the children are even born. But this sort of dramatically confident view is also one-sided: it ignores the existence of culture, the influence of society, and what Hobbes calls &quot;the Social Contract&quot;. The Oankali perceive a predictability in humans&#039; genetic makeup that persists whether the humans exist in a &quot;state of nature&quot; or not. Granted, the behavior of the humans we see in the book seems &quot;nasty, brutish, and short&quot; except on account of the intervention by Oankali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also suggestions that the Oankali view is not all-encompassing. The Oankali claim that the &quot;Trade&quot; with humans is in part an exchange of cultural practices â€“ but it doesn&#039;t seem like the Oankali have a culture outside of their biology. They have no written records â€“ in fact, they do not wish for Lilith to have writing implements intially, either â€“ but instead rely only on their infallible memories. They have no tradition of fiction, myth, or lying. The closest they come to art is in the shaping of new creatures to serve their needs â€“ and even that seems painfully utilitarian. And even though they claim to be interested in human culture, they really seem to fear it. Take this episode, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:1em; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding: .5em;&quot;&gt;&quot;The music would soon either drive the storytellers into one of the houses or, more likely, bring them into the singing and dancing. Oankali did not like music. They began to withdraw into the houses â€“ to save their hearing, they said. Most constructs enjoyed music as much as Humans did. Several Oankali-born construct males had become wandering musicians, more than welcome at any trade village.&quot; (Butler 439)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oankali willingly walk away from human culture, ignore it as best they can. They have no use for it. The reasons for this aren&#039;t clear: but my best guess is that it&#039;s not biological enough for them. It is as if the Oankali&#039;s ability to perceive biology so completely blinds them to the worth of non-biological practices. Their ability to communicate directly to one another through sense-tentacles could be related: Akin admits that acting at least is &quot;like when [the Oankali and Constructs] touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (Butler 409). Actually, this description of acting resembles Ursula Le Guin&#039;s explanation of fiction as a method of &quot;describing certain aspects of psychological reality in the novelist&#039;s way, which is by inventing elaborately circumstantial lies&quot; (&lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, Introduction). So if fiction is a method for abstractly conveying difficult information, then Constructs should have no need for it, and in fact this is true. But at the same time, the Constructs enjoy music as much as humans. And even though natural Oankali are not musical, what the Ooloi do is &quot;almost like making music â€“ balancing endorphins, silencing pain, maintaining sobriety... Ooloi made great harmonies, interweaving people and sharing pleasure&quot; (512). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Oankali, then, biology does not simply replace art; biology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; art, and other forms of art are unnecessary. They do not partake in the trade of books and paintings, and they seem to scarcely acknowledge their value, even though they also claim that human culture is greatly significant. In the end, it may be significant because it is the one aspect of humans they least understand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Y - The Last Man</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&#039;s a comic book series called &quot;Y - The Last Man&quot; that&#039;s actually pretty related to the topics we&#039;ve been discussing lately. But unlike Left Hand of Darkness, which shows us a world where the two sexes as we know them have been sort of combined, this series shows us a world where one sex just ceases to exist. &lt;!--break--&gt;The story is about an English major named Yorick, and his pet monkey Ampersand, who are (apparently) the last remaining male mammals on planet earth after a catastrophe instantaneously wipes out all the others. Here&#039;s the description from the back of the first chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 4em&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Unmanned World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/2469/ythelastman00132ii4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid #888888&quot;/&gt;In the summer of 2002, a plague of unknown origin destroyed every last sperm, fetus, and fully developed mammal with a Y chromosome (with the apparent exception of one young man and his male pet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;gendercide&quot; instantaneously exterminated 48% of the global population, or approximately 29 billion men. 495 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are now dead, as are 99% of the world&#039;s landowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States alone, more than 95% of all commercial pilots, truck drivers, and ship captains died... as did 92% of violent felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally, 99% of all mechanics, electricians, and construction workers are now deceased... though 51% of the world&#039;s &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; labor force is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 nations, including Spain and Germany, have women soldiers who have served in ground combat units. &lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt; of the United States&#039; nearly 200,000 female troops have ever participated in ground combat. Australia, Norway, and Sweden are the only countries with women serving on board submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, all women between the ages of 18 and 26 have performed compulsory military service in the IDF for at least one year and nine months. Before the Plague, at least three Palestinian suicide bombers had been women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, 85% of all government representatives are now dead... as are 100% of Catholic priests, Muslim imams, and Orthodox Jewish rabbis.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&#039;m not sure if the &quot;29 billion men&quot; statistic is meant to be 2.9 or if it&#039;s referring to the male mammals also exterminated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series presents a pretty interesting view of what would happen. There&#039;s a fair amount of comic-book-ized material, like the badass secret agent who helps protect Yorick, and lots of somewhat cheesey, somewhat witty dialogue... but it&#039;s good. Some interesting phenomena that pop up: the &quot;Amazons&quot;, a cult whose philosophy is that men were punished and that the world is better off; Congress faces issues putting itself back together, because the remaining members are overwhelmingly Democrats, which the remaining ones see as unfair. Oh yeah, and there&#039;s less sex than you&#039;d think, because as it turns out, Yorick is trying to find his fiancÃ©, who was studying abroad in Australia when the Plague hit - unfortunately, it&#039;s not easy for anyone to find a boat or an airplane after the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Weather Versus Ambisexuality in The Left Hand of Darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/137</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ursula Le Guin, though she makes a big fuss out of the &quot;thought-experimental&quot; nature of her novel, and explicitly says that she&#039;s not trying to make a political statement such as &quot;we damned well ought to be androgynous&quot; - but even so, she seems to intentionally pad levels of ambiguity â€“ maybe even excuses, plausible deniability â€“ into any possible &quot;message&quot; of her novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest features of Gethenian society that seems to contain a hidden moral supposition is this: &quot;they [do] not go to war&quot; (48). The clarification: &quot;they behaved like animals, in that respect, or like women&quot; (48) â€“ the mention of women especially hints that Gethenians are incapable of going to war because they are too feminine, and women don&#039;t go to war. (Personally, I don&#039;t take that for granted, but for the sake of argument, I&#039;ll let it go.) The problem is that their peculiar androgyny is not the only defining feature of Gethenian culture â€“ they also live in probably the coldest environment among the novel&#039;s known inhabited planets. It is a well-supported theory in life outside this novel that geography and environment are determining features of culture (see: &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;); and that makes it believable that the Gethenian inability to mobilize is the result of their weather. Consider: going to war is an enormous undertaking; oftentimes in the past, wars had to be postponed during winter months. Part of what made Hannibal an amazing general is that he managed to cross the Alps, which are snowy all year round, and even then his army suffered massive losses. The Gethenians would have to face that sort of weather everywhere, almost all the time; war would be a massively wasteful, unproductive undertaking for them, in comparison to our wars (and that&#039;s assuming that real wars are productive!). It&#039;s impossible to rule, therefore, that their androgyny is what makes Gethenians unwarlike; but it&#039;s also impossible to rule out that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within the novel, &quot;it seems likely that [the Gethenians are] an experiment&quot; (89). But what kind of experiment are they? If they were meant to be set up in opposition to other humans, then the experiment is critically flawed, because there is no strict control â€“ there are two variables, ambisexuality and extremely cold weather. For a realistic scientific experiment, the constraints are too loose, for the reasons I&#039;ve already spelled out. However, the idea that Gethenians exist on account of &quot;human genetic manipulation&quot; (89) is a convenient one for avoiding difficult issues such as proposing that such an evolution from humans is possible, likely, or natural. Otherwise, one might suppose that Ursula Le Guin was suggesting that humans would eventually become this way; or that humans could just have easily turned out this way. But instead, she sets down the opposite notion: that this sort of thing is nigh-impossible, and exists by mere contrivance. She calls attention to the falseness of the situation in such a way that it seems to discredit value judgments of any kind. The Gethenians are not explicitly better or worse, by any standards, than normal humans; they are just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this sort of thing is all over the novel. It&#039;s almost as if Le Guin knows she&#039;s treading on sensitive ground here, and so she restrains herself from making any claims that could be construed as outrageous. Whether in doing so, she undermines the meaningfulness of her novel or allows it to be all the more insidiously thought-provoking is anyone&#039;s guess.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as Hope in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/105</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/99&quot;&gt;dreamfall17&#039;s comments about the loss of hope in Children of Men&lt;/a&gt;, I did some thinking about hope in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and stumbled on the idea â€“ which I presume to see, at least â€“ that sex is the predominant source of hope in this novel. Constantly, various male characters in the book seem to be offering illicit intercourse to Offred â€“ from the doctor offering to impregnate her (60-61) to the young Guardian who looks her in the eye, implying some sort of sexual possibility (21). Even though she does not take them up on these offers, they provide her the opportunity to imagine having the freedom to do so. These &quot;moments [that] are the rewards&quot; Offred keeps &quot;like the candy [she] hoarded as a child&quot; (21) â€“ just the minuscule breaking of rules which permits Offred to imagine &quot;what if&quot; they secretly met romantically. Similarly, the way she can make &quot;the full red skirt sway&quot; like &quot;teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach&quot; is a source of &quot;power&quot; (22). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Nick and Fred provide similar hope: the pleasure of Nick&#039;s approach in the sitting room is a refreshing pleasure: &quot;It&#039;s so good, to be touched by someone, to be felt so greedily, to feel so greedy&quot; - almost as if Luke had returned to her (99). Every encounter like this provides a hint that the desexualized â€“ or rather, desensualized â€“ society of Gilead isn&#039;t inevitable, that there are others like Offred who want to have â€“ dare I say â€“ &quot;sexy encounters&quot; with each other and will go to great lengths to do so. Just like the scene where Fred hands her a preserved copy of Vogue and watches her read through it. It&#039;s not sex â€“ but with the content of those magazines being what they are, it&#039;s still a &quot;naughty&quot; pleasure beyond just breaking the rules (157).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only actual &quot;sexual act&quot; regularly occurring in Offred&#039;s life is not hopeful. It is &quot;performed... in a perfunctory way&quot; (160) with only the emotion of embarrassment. So it&#039;s sex, but it&#039;s not sexuality. In reality, the true hope in the book is not the act of intercourse, but the act of &lt;em&gt;lovemaking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Breaking Down Cyberpunk: Matrix and Disillusionment</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/69</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer is widely known as the defining novel of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; subgenre (of which I am particularly a fan) â€“ so, regardless of what has happened in science fiction since then, the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; was specifically applied to this novel as a defining mark. Therefore, disassembling that word should provide some insight into the defining features of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a composite of two terms - &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;, the sources are obvious. The &quot;cyber&quot; doubtlessly refers to &quot;cyberspace&quot;, the term coined by Neuromancer for describing the world in which people enter when they plug into the &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; of the matrix. Much of the novel is set in this realm: if we count time spent on simstim, Case is in cyberspace probably more often than everywhere else combined. So that much is obvious â€“ the &quot;cyber&quot; means that the characters live in a universe where a digital communication network is as important â€“ if not more important â€“ than the physical world, otherwise known as &quot;meatspace&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other part, the &quot;punk&quot; half, is perhaps more interesting. The characters of Neuromancer, Case especially, aren&#039;t good guys. Case doesn&#039;t work for charity, he doesn&#039;t fight for what&#039;s right, and his only motivations appear to be self-preservation, the pursuit of the next high, and simple hatred. But that&#039;s simplifying things. For a moment, Case is something different, when he spouts at 3Jane: &quot;What&#039;ll ever fucking change for you? You&#039;ll wind up like the old man. You&#039;ll tear it all down and start building again! You&#039;ll build the walls back, tighter and tighter....I got no idea at all what&#039;ll happen if Wintermute wins, but it&#039;ll change something!&quot; (260). For this moment, it seems like Case is hoping for a better future, not just for himself, but for 3Jane and everyone else. But that&#039;s not what happens. In the end, &quot;Things aren&#039;t different. Things are things,&quot; and that&#039;s all that Post-Wintermute has to say about it. And after that final revelation, Case gives up and reverts to his previous self, blowing his reward cash on a new pancreas and liver that will allow him to receive normal effects from the amphetamines to which he is addicted.  Case undergoes a transformation from criminal, to idealistic hero, back to disillusioned criminal.  In this way, the cynical message of the book can be seen to represent the &quot;punk&quot; aspect â€“ and this is the attitude which defines not only Neuromancer, but the cyberpunk genre in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bugs in Starship Troopers as Nature, not Race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that it&#039;s a common trope in science fiction for ideas about divisions of race to be transplanted to racial boundaries â€“ as if the authors are saying, &quot;Look, if they can get along with wookies, why can&#039;t we humans all get along among ourselves?&quot; It&#039;s such a common device, in fact, that it becomes difficult to recognize when alien species are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent ethnicities. However, the Bugs from &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; may actually be something different â€“ for lack of a better term, I&#039;ll describe their presence as a force of Nature, not Race (with a capital R) in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the relationship between the humans of the Terran Federation and the Bugs doesn&#039;t resemble racial conflict â€“ the only interactions between the two are acts of destruction. Historically, racial conflict doesn&#039;t take the form of immediate, all-out war: the Europeans and American Indians were able to participate in trade and exchange of ideas before prejudice and hatred built up to cause the two sides to begin fighting each other; trade in slaves from Africa was facilitated at least by the cooperation of some leaders within that continent; even the American Civil War was not fought as a battle of &quot;black versus white&quot; at all. However, in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;, the two sides are not just completely at odds with each other militarily: the Terran Federation &quot;[understands] [the Bugs] as little as [it] [understands] termites&quot; (222). The Terran Federation doesn&#039;t even have the faintest idea what the Bugs&#039; motivation is for fighting or when it might be possible to declare peace â€“ they don&#039;t even really know how bugs live, other than the very basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bugs and the humans appears most obviously in Johnny&#039;s proof about war as a cause of population pressure: &quot;Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us outâ€“because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate&quot; (186). This begins to resemble the conflict between American Indians and Europeans, but in the case of the American Indians, as members of the same species, they ended up becoming somewhat mixed in with the European population that invaded â€“ no such thing is possible (as far as we can see) with the Bugs. The conflict is meant to be seen in a similar situation as that of the &quot;retarded&quot; wildlife of Sanctuary - &quot;When types that had evolved on a planet enjoying high radiation and fierce competition were introduced, the native stuff was outclassed&quot; (155). The humans and the Bugs in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t communicate, they don&#039;t intermarry and they certainly don&#039;t hold Thanksgiving dinners together before killing each other: they&#039;re opposing species from different environments, and when they come into conflict, it&#039;s kill or be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>How to Build a Universe That Doesn&#039;t Fall Apart Two Days Later</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/18</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a great essay by Philip K. Dick (an excellent and important writer whom our reading list kind of grazes) about the purpose and meaning to be found in science fiction. He doesn&#039;t directly tackle issues of race and gender, but his interpretations of the purpose of science fiction are fascinating and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting subjects touched on in this essay: Disneyland and &quot;fake fakes&quot;, universes that DO fall apart, and poor translations of his novels. The main thrust of his argument is that science fiction is passed off as patently, unabashedly spurious, and yet there&#039;s some parallel way in which many of the things in science fiction are true - sometimes in ways the author could never have predicted. In some ways, he sees a more complex picture than the idea of science fiction as thinly-veiled political writing, which we&#039;ve already covered as the blanket interpretation of the genre. Though, honestly, as the essay progresses, it becomes more and more clear what a disturbed person Philip K. Dick is, but his persistent wit makes it worth checking out anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://deoxy.org/pkd_how2build.htm&quot;&gt;How to Build a Universe That Doesn&#039;t Fall Apart Two Days Later&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;ll probably take you less than an hour and it&#039;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
