 <title>What did the bugs represent to you?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/12</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was reading this book it occurred to me that the the &quot;bugs&quot; that the humans are fighting could potentially represent some different themes.  The ones that I could quickly come up with are: (1) there were some obvious communist references to the bugs&#039; way of life and getting rid of the &quot;bugs&quot; or commies might be something Heinlein is trying to say.  Considering the book was written in 1959 I think this could make sense. (2) As was briefly mentioned in class on Wednesday, when inter-species extermination is involved, racial purification might be implied.  Especially since the humans were portrayed as better than the bugs. (3) I&#039;m more inclined to believe that it doesn&#039;t really matter.  Heinlein needed some type of enemy so that he had a forum to lay out his political beliefs.  Much to my surprise (and disappointment) this book did not really contain that much action (unlike the movie) and to me it felt like this book was more of a political statement (i.e. pro military, kind of fascist etc...) than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Those were the main ones I could come up with and I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas/thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
