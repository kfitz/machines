 <title>Am I the only one...?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/366</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one in class who does not like BSG? I have made it through the miniseries and first half of the first season and just can&#039;t seem to feel any interest in the happenings of the show or the lives of the characters. Frankly, I don&#039;t really care what happens and find it all rather boring. Perhaps I am just shallow, but there is something about the whole political-drama-in-space thing that really puts me off when it comes to SF TV and movies. I&#039;ve always liked comedic stuff with lots of space battles and explosions!!!  Action-adventurey shows I supposeâ€¦ Indiana Jones in space! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&#039;t have any particular reason for this weird double-standard about SF TV (which I didn&#039;t even realize I had until trying to watch BSG). I&#039;m sure I am now going to be eaten alive for not appreciating this and that and all the intricacies of the show and whatnot, but I don&#039;t think I am going to be getting over this double-standard anytime soon.  So I was just curious as to if there is anyone else who isn&#039;t enjoying BSG thus far and if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pigoon Platoon... a last minute response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/356</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this response has nothing to do with pigoon platoons (although that bit where they trapped Snowman in the guardhouse was a bit unnerving) it just seemed catchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I actually want to discuss is sort of a response to a comment made in class (I think). I seem to recall someone mentioning something about Snowman being able to handle the whole apocalypse situation oddly well and the more I thought about it the more I started to think he wasn&#039;t really handling it that well at all. From the beginning we know that he is hearing voices which aren&#039;t even Oryx, for &quot;Oryx is no longer very talkative&quot; (11). He hates these voices and is staring to behave like the &quot;crazed lice-infested hermits in their caves and deserts&quot; who used to also hear such voices (11). When it comes to alcohol &quot;his impulse (is) to drink it up as fast as possible, turn all memory to white noise,&quot; not exactly the frame of mind of someone who is handling a situation well so much as making do in a pretty horrific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does at times seem to be taking good care of the Crakers, or at least not abandoning them. My thoughts about that are because he sees so much of Oryx in them. They have that innocence that she had and because of her connection to them I think it would be very hard for him to just leave them to their own devices. They also give him something to do. As was pointed out, he basically made his living just making things up and now is doing exactly the same thing and also learning from it. They also keep him company as best any living thing can at this point and he is afraid to &quot;lose his audience&quot; and that &quot;they&#039;d turn their backs on him, they&#039;d wander away&quot; (104). He needs some contact and has to make do with them even though they cannot understand so much and their questions can be frustrating at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also isn&#039;t doing well physically. The food he eats seems to come primarily from cans of left over from before and filled with such tasty things as &quot;SoyOBoy wieners&quot; and &quot;Sveltana No-Meat Cocktail Sausages.&quot; He doesn&#039;t hunt anything or even fish, and only gets this fish from the Crakers who bring it to him once a week. He looks for mirrors whenever he cans and what is sees is &quot;Increasingly â€¦ a shock. A stranger stares back at him, bleary-eyed, hollow-cheeked, pocked with bug-bite scabs. He looks twenty years older than he is&quot; (231).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that he is more a man who is making do as best he can, although there are probably people who could have done much better than he is. For instance, the humans he almost meets at the very end are at least cooking for themselves. Just some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>pattern recognition response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/325</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it&#039;s been a while since I last posted a response, so here are some thoughts about Pattern Recognition. Two aspects of this which I thought were quite interesting were the ideas of mirror worlds and soul-delay.  What struck me as particularly interesting about mirror worlds was that, in a way, I read the book as thought it was set in a mirror world to our own.  It is a world we more or less know, but the manner in which Gibson presents it is quite foreign. There are Starbucks on street corners, familiar cities and recognizable brand names are everywhere. It&#039;s a version of our world, only tweaked slightly. There are other corporations as well and the use of technology, while it seems quite commonplace in 2008, was something not unheard of, but pretty new back in 2002. I found that the notion of &quot;cognitive estrangement&quot; worked well in this regard since its just similar enough to home that the differences can be off-putting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of soul delay I also thought was intriguing. Cayce explains that &quot;Damien&#039;s theory of jet lag is correct: that her mortal soul is leagues behind her, being reeled in on some ghostly umbilical down the vanished wake of the plane that brought her here, hundreds of thousands of feet above the Atlantic. Souls can&#039;t move that quickly, and are left behind, and must be awaited, upon arrival, like lost luggage&quot; (1-2).  She seems to be very concerned with soul-delay. I thought it was interesting so I made little ticks when it was mentioned and ended up making about two dozen ticks. In fact, she seems to be concerned with souls in general. When discussing how people of the future will look on people of her time she says that they won&#039;t think about  &quot;ordinary actual living souls&quot; (58) And that her father&#039;s colleagues were not &quot;felled by anything more sinister than stress and overwork, and perhaps by a species of depression engendered by too long and too closely observing the human soul&quot; (227) Interestingly, despite constantly discussing souls and soul-delay she claims that she doesn&#039;t know if she really believes in human souls. Perhaps it&#039;s the same way she doesn&#039;t actually believe in the EVP messages her mother is constantly sending her but which do &quot;creep (her) out&quot; (275) There seems to be a definitiveness about death, especially of the death of her father, which she doesn&#039;t want to accept and souls (and EVP) are a way to extend the life of someone, so to speak, although they aren&#039;t always believed to actually exist in a technologically and scientifically based world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Random thoughts on subscripts...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/193</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was browsing the blog and felt like I would try and comment on dragongrrl&#039;s note about hoping someone comments about the subscripts. My initial reaction was that they seemed a bit silly. As though Delany was somehow trying to make the novel look more scientific by adding subscripts in like one would add subscripts to variables or chemical equations. I was a bit disappointed by this, but as the story went on I came to understand that use of subscripts was an interesting was to differentiate between the type of relationship a person has with her different occupations. (Also, I couldn&#039;t get the subscripts to actually be subscripts, but oh well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the use of the subscripts was interesting basically because to me it seemed to imply different levels of connectedness between the person and their occupation. The first level was just what we would think of as a job. The place we go each day to make a living. For Marq, work1 was her job as an Industrial Diplomat, traveling about and getting various jobs completed.  When the students are introduced, it is mentioned that two of them have jobs1 as evelmian ethnologists. The relationship between an occupation1 and what we would consider an occupation seemed fairly straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was Marq&#039;s job2. I&#039;m still not totally sure what this was but it came across as something much more intrinsic than her job1 as an Industrial Diplomat. It almost seemed to me as though this was something that Marq had been expected to do for all of her life.  My impression of this comes from a part on page 108 when Marq is talking to Alsrod about how she has been trying since childhood to get the statue of Mother Dyeth to turn on. According to Alsrod, Marq was just doing part of her job2.  This mention of her job2, as well as other mentions, made me think that this occupation2 related in some way to an understanding of her home and family as well as a passing on of that knowledge. For instance, orientating the new students was considered Marq&#039;s job2, rather than job2 and the orientation sessions are referred to as sessions2 (191).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there was a certain level of occupation that each person had which was more intrinsic than what we would normally consider a job was quite interesting. People seem to have a job2 which they are expected to work towards for their entire lives, perhaps indicating that one&#039;s occupation2 and self are more closely connected than what we might normally consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a third level of job. Marq mention that her hands are &quot;of a fairly small, somewhat hairy fellow who only uses them for manual labor one job2 out of three&quot; (201). Unfortunately for me I didn&#039;t write down any other mentions of this third occupation although I think there was one place where a job3 was referred to.  My question about this job3 is; what could be deeper to Marq than her job2? Her job2 already seems to be an essential part of her character and something she has been doing her whole life, so I am curious as to what could be even more a part of her than this.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Liliths - Response 5</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/161</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My reaction to Lilith&#039;s Brood after just reading the title was to think, &quot;Lilith! What a terrible name for parents to give their child!&quot; I didn&#039;t know too much about Lilith, other than that she was supposed to be the first wife of Adam, according to apocryphal texts, and that she supposedly killed children. From where I was coming from, that didn&#039;t seem like the best name for parents to give their daughter, although I was intrigued as to how the choice of name would play out in the three books. For instance Tino, upon hearing her name, remarks that it is an &quot;unusual name loaded with bad connotations&quot; (285). I have to agree, although it could very well be that he is just referring to the stories he as heard about Lilith Iyapo. Nonetheless, many of the stories of Lilith Iyapo have interesting parallels with various stories of Lilith. So, I it would be a good idea to read up a little more on the background of Lilith and the various stories surrounding her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that she was much more than just the child killer and first wife of Adam that I had originally thought and that many of the earlier traits ascribed to her are clearly reflected in the character in the text.  In early Sumerian texts she was a demon who would visit men in the night and have children by them. This notion of her as a child bearing demon continues into the Talmudic period where, according to Raphael Patai, she was unhappy as Adam&#039;s first wife so she fled and went to the Red Sea where she &quot;engaged in unbridled promiscuity, and bore  a demonic brood of more than one hundred a day&quot; (Patai 296). Woah!  A brood! Lilith&#039;s bearing of a demonic brood relates very well to the perception of Butler&#039;s Lilith by the resisters.  Lilith herself raises the objection early in Dawn, terrified after learning how her children will no longer be human, she fears that the Oankali will &quot;make mules of our children sterile monsters&quot; (55). The resisters see the children as just that, monsters, the demon brood, and they perceive her children as the end of the human race. They are not human and they are the ones who are going to repopulate the planet, not the human race which the Oankali claim to have been saving. Having been previously unaware of this aspect of the story of Lilith, I thought it was very interesting that the title seems to suggest there is possibly something demonic, or at least unhuman, about her children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith is also concerned with childbirth. According to sources cited by Patai, women would recite certain incantations to protect themselves from the complications that she could cause in child birthing. In fact, it was possible for her to cause sterility. In a way resistors blamer her for much of what has happened. She is there Judas goat (245) and it is because of her, or at least can be seen to because of her, that the human race will no longer survive. The human race is now sterile without the Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also texts which tell of Lilith as being the wife of Samael (Patai 308).  Where Adam was, at least, human, Lilith is now the wife of a demon. The Oankali in the minds of the resistors? And here again there is the fear that they might fill with world with &quot;their demonic brood&quot; so God takes it upon himself to castrate Samael. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels with the different religious and mythological Liliths and the role of Lilith Iyapo as seen from the resistors point of view was an aspect of Dawn and Adulthood Rites that I thought was very interesting, especially not knowing much about the history of Lilith. The demonic aspect of her through history and her demonic children who threaten to fill the world, fit well with the fears of the resistors who believe that the construct children are not human and yet they will be the ones to inherit the restored Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the link to the article I read which does a great job tracing the changes of Lilith:&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>A mob scene</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/108</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading The Handmaid&#039;s Tale I noticed that there were many instances in which the mentality of the mob took control over that of the individual. This served as another way for the Handmaids to lose some of the individuality to the theocracy of the Republic of Gilead. What struck me most, however, was that there are also references to the mob mentality in the context of the actions of Offred&#039;s mother in the time before the republic. That the mob mentality is seen in both eras was quite an interesting similarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways in which this mob mentality is represented in The Republic of Gilead. The Prayvaganzas and Particicution are two of the most obvious ways this mob mentality is represented. Offred herself even admits says that &quot;despite myself I feel my hands clench,&quot; and she knows she wants &quot;to tear, gouge, rend&quot; at the man (279). She understands, on the one hand, that she is being drawn into all of this, but falls for it anyway. I suppose that is all part of the mob mentality.  Another instance where I thought the effects of a mob mentality were particularly evident was the Janine/Ofwarren&#039;s birthing. The other Handmaids &quot;lean forward, tensed, the muscles in (their) backs and bellies hurt from the strain&quot; (125). They are actually experiencing, to an extent, the birth for themselves, losing themselves completely in the process. A mob or herd mentality is certainly one way for people to lose individualism, as they just become part of the crowd and follow the crowd&#039;s actions despite what they may or may not believe themselves. Through use of activities that encourage this mob mentality it seems like the theocracy of Gilead is doing a rather good job of stripping the Handmaids of some of their individualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also mentions of the mob mentality as it existed in &quot;the time before.&quot; The most notable of these is when Offred recalls the political activism of her mother in feminist activities of the late 1970s. The first instance is when she recalls the book burning that took place at the park where she though her mother was taking her to feed the ducks. There were men and women around the bonfire, &quot;some of them were chantingâ€¦ Their faces were happy, ecstatic almost&quot; (38). She evokes an image that seems reminiscent of book burnings from Fascist regimes. The second time she mentions it is in a flashback to a Domestic Science class. Her mother is in the video they watch and eventually just &quot;is part of the crowdâ€¦, (she) can&#039;t see her anymore&quot; (120). Here there is a definite sense of a loss of identity and individualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to me that Atwood would include this in both the before time and the time of the Republic of Gilead. The mob mentality seems to survive, although what it becomes in the theocracy is the opposite of what it stood for in the democracy from before. The rallies and large social gatherings are no longer for women to come together in support of new freedoms, but to come together in very traditional settings. In either case, there is a loss of self to the crowd in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t actually know anything about feminism or its history. I would like to find a way to connect this with a possible critique of the feminism of the late 1970s and early 1980s. That Atwood used a book burning I thought was very interesting, because those have such strong connections with oppressive regimes. I suppose this is another point I&#039;m interested in discussing, but don&#039;t know enough about to actually discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Case the Cowboy</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/81</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After class yesterday I realized that we didn&#039;t really talk much about Case as a cowboy and the fact that Gibson chose that term for the people who make a living hacking into cyberspace. I think someone mentioned how cyberspace could be seen as the wild west as it is a new frontier, and someone also mentioned how the physical descriptions of Case aren&#039;t what a reader would normally associate with cowboys. This got me to thinking that Case&#039;s work as a hacker into cyberspace doesn&#039;t really seem to fit with the term cowboy. On the one hand I think of cowboys as guys who went west in the 19th century and worked with horses and cows, rode in rodeos, and basically did a lot of physical work. Quite the opposite of Case whose employment depends on his ability to use his mind. I also tend to think about cowboys as they appear in westerns, particularly those of the 1950s, like Zorro, Roy Rogers and the Lone Ranger. These men go about and are a, as the theme to Zorro says, &quot;friend of the weak, and the poor and the meek.&quot; Once again, I don&#039;t really see Case in this light either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that he seems more like a bandit or bushranger, albeit one who has skills for hire.  He&#039;s a bit of a loner, although he has his girl occasionally and he will work in teams when necessary. The part where the pull of the robbery of Sense/Net to get the Dixie Flatline struck me as a heist and in terms of the wild west, a bank robbery. The Flatline is locked in a vault for starters and then when Molly gets stopped by a guard who asks if she is an employee she responds  by &quot;driving the first two knuckles of her right hand into the man&#039;s solar plexus.&quot; It&#039;s not shooting him, but it takes him out violently, like bandits sometimes did to people who got in their way. Still though, Case doesn&#039;t have the physicality associated with bandits and bushrangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious about what other people think. Whether Case is closer to a cowboy or a bandit in term of the wild west analogy. And how Molly would fit into that analogy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Space-rastas and Doctor Who (aka Response #2)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/47</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just finished reading Neuromancer, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I&#039;ve never read any cyberpunk before, so it was certainly an interesting read.  For some reason I am drawn to the idea of an imperfect future where things are grungy and gross and the people are flawed. I suppose it seems to me like a more realistic version of the future than one in which everyone gets along and there is no poverty and crime (i.e. the Star Trek universe). Perhaps I have little faith in humanity?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple things that interested me in Neuromancer. The first was the role of the Rastafarians. It almost seemed like they were the religious aspect of the story.  At the very least, Gibson certainly seemed interested in bringing certain aspects of that culture into his story.  For instance, there are many references to Babylon. The Founders of Zion are willing to help Molly and Case because they will &quot;bring a scourge on Babylon&quot; and &quot;may serve as a tool of Final Days&quot; (109-110).  In Rastafarian culture Babylon is corrupt society (I suppose in the book it would be the Sprawl and other Earth and non Rastafarian cultures in general), whereas Zion (in the book the home of the Rastafarians) is good. Zion also has connections to Africa which in turn makes me think back to Marcus Garvey and the Back-to-Africa movement. I don&#039;t remember my history too well here, but since the name of the tug was Marcus Garvey I think I am making a valid connection. There was also a connection made between Molly and &quot;Steppin&#039; Razor&quot; which was a song by Peter Tosh who was a reggae musician (109). On the other hand, the Rastafarians seemed rather one-dimensional and stereotypical. They were constantly getting high and spoke with very thick accents and they just didn&#039;t seem to have too much substance.  They&#039;re characters seem set in their ways and just less fleshed out than the others. This has led me to wonder exactly what Gibson&#039;s purpose was in using the Rastafarian culture as part of his story. He delves into many other cultures and subcultures in particular the Panther Moderns, but I&#039;m unclear as to what made him pick Rastafarians in particular as the allies of Case, Molly and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I also really liked the use of technology. It kept amazing me that the book was written back in the early 1980s. The whole concept of the matrix and cyberspace and virtual reality has always been something I thought of a relatively new, so his use of these ideas in the early 80s I thought was very forward thinking. The idea of hacking into systems and spreading viruses seems so current! One thing that I wasn&#039;t too keen on, however, was the all the product placement (for lack of a better term). There was Sony here, Hitachi there, and then there were the little microsoft slivers used by the Panther Moderns.  On the one hand I found this annoying because it made the universe that Gibson created seem less foreign. On the other hand the dominance of certain corporations in the technology industry can&#039;t be denied and the use of big company names seemed to make that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I suppose, I am left with two questions. Why did Gibson choose to use Rastafarian culture so prominently in the novel? While he certainly brings out many aspects of Rastafarian culture and religion, he never goes much deeper into the characters themselves which is disappointing. Second, why the brand names? Was it meant to make a connection between their time and ours? Or to show how technology as an industry is dominated by large corporations? I&#039;m just uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as I was writing this I remembered a Doctor Who serial which features a computer program called the Matrix! In the show it was a sort of virtual reality that a person could &quot;jack into&quot; using a big thing that came down over their head. I&#039;m pretty sure that this episode was from the mid 1970s which would predate the novelâ€¦ interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Response!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/29</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So here it is, my very first reading response for my very first lit class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was reading Starship Troopers over the weekend, I found that I was rather surprised with the parallels between the Bugs and the people of the Terran Federation. There seemed to be this common need to put the needs of the group in general before the needs of the individual. This in turn, I found a bit strange because I was under the impression that Heinlein was opposed to communism which is almost what he was advocating. Anyway, there were two parallels in particular that caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first parallel has to do with citizenship. To earn it, a person has to put in their two or more years of federal service, in the military or otherwise, and only then are they entitled to vote. According to Colonel Dubois, &quot;citizenship isâ€¦an emotional conviction that the whole is greater than the part&quot; (163).  Rather than the importance of the individual within society, it is the society, or at least a larger group than just the individual, that matters. This is, apparently, even mathematically provable according to Juan&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy class. &quot;All correctâ€¦ moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level -- as in a father who dies to save his children&quot; he says (185). The greater good being more important than that of the individual seems to be true of the Bugs as well, although they don&#039;t ever question these actions. Certain castes are simply destined to carryout whatever actions they are delegated. They are, in essence, programmed to die so that their race can survive. Interestingly, in both instances the behavior stems from instinct despite the two races being quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also leads me to think about the instance in which Juan determines that it is worth going to war to save just one man. This seems to counter the previous belief as here a greater group is worth sacrificing just to save one man who &quot;may not deserve it â€¦ [or] may die in the meantime&quot; because &quot;thousands of people get killed every day in accidents&quot; (178).  I suppose this has to do with the military belief that no man should be left behind, but the fact that it opposes what has been established as human instinct strikes me as rather interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second comparison between MIs and Bug society is to do with the hierarchy established by each. It almost seems at times that the ideal MIs structure is close to that of the Bugs. The people at the bottom have their orders and are expected to carry them out, if not, they run the chance of suffering the same fate as the Third Lieutenant who fought in the Napoleonic Wars, who &quot;was tried for `deserting his post of duty as commanding officer in the presence of the enemy.&#039; Convicted. Cashiered&quot; even though he had been trying to save his commanding officer (194).  The worker Bugs on the other hand are &quot;hardly more than animate machinery&quot; and cannot disobey and warriors are &quot;are almost as stupid without a director as workers&quot; (194). What the MIs strive for is what the Bugs are born with although both have an instinct to place the needs of many above the needs of few.&lt;/p&gt;
