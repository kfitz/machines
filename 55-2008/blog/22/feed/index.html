 <title>Oryx and Crake...Apocalypse or Rebirth?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/349</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The central event for the novel Oryx in Crake is the advent of a mega-virus, named JUVE, which nearly completely obliterates the human population.  All that remains after it sweeps the world are Snowman, aka Jimmy, and a bunch of &quot;Crakes&quot;...genetically engineered humans designed to live easily and peacefully.  Oh, and apparently some other humans...but we don&#039;t find that out till the end (and book doesn&#039;t say much about them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the novel is divided into two distinct parts -- before and after this apocalypse respectively -- that are interwoven together such that we alternate between the past and the present Jimmy/Snowman.  The &quot;before&quot; period shows Jimmy&#039;s life and work with Crake up until the virus, and the &quot;after&quot; Jimmy&#039;s (now called Snowman) life as the only surviving regular human (so he believes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description aside, one of the more interesting aspects of this event is the fact that a new species of humans comes out of it nearly alone.  These Crakes are an interesting sort, and before the catastrophe were intended just to be models of how humans could be improved...and become self sufficient.  However, Crake himself apparently had other ideas in mind and intentionally killed off pretty much all of the world&#039;s population in what appears to be an attempt to restart the human race...hence making the Crakes immune to his virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now: did he succeed in his aims?  From what I can tell, Crake had some sort of conviction to fix the way humans lived and interacted with the environment.  He viewed the current human society as wasteful, destructive, and violent....and he wished to change those tendencies.  Case in point, the Crakes.  Totally docile, self sufficient, and easily adaptable...these new &quot;humans&quot; were his attempt to create a perfect sort of race that could live in harmony forever.  His virus was the method by which to remove the flawed humans to give way for new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did it have the desired effect?  Personally, I would say yes....and no.  Yes, he did eradicate nearly all humans and created a self-sufficient peaceful group of humans.  Yes, his plans fell into place as he expected.  NO, because of Snowman.  Much as Snowman is only one human and will not reproduce...he still exists to propagate the old human way.  He is still an influence on the Crakes, teaching them random things that they would otherwise not care for.  Snowman&#039;s recollections and descriptions of the Crakes contrast jarringly...showing just how simple and almost animalistic they are.  Perhaps this was the idea, but one could argue that this demeans humanity more than it improves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll put this simply.  While Crake may have removed many of the flaws inherent to humans, he also removed most (if not all) of the things that make them truly human.  Sure, they can talk and be curious about things...but will they ever discover, design, invent, be creative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have intelligence, but because of Crake it is put to no use.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Forum in Pattern Recognition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/318</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon reading William Gibson&#039;s novel &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, I noticed that the main character Cayce&#039;s life is sort-of divided into two different &quot;realms&quot;.  The first is reality, or better put her life outside in the city meeting people, working, discussing trends, etc.  The second, and the one that caught my interest, is her life and interaction on the forum, Fetish:Footage:Forum, which almost ends up being another world for Cayce and the other major posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum itself simply deals in what is called &quot;footage&quot;, essentially what seems to be porn videos of various forms and makes, but from the way that Cayce and other regular posters interact on the forum its more than just a fetish gallery.  Praise, arguments, friends, foes....the forum is a gathering place for more than just fetishists (so it seems...its not like Cayce is continually obsessed with that stuff in the novel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about the forum though, I tend to compare it to the forums that I have seen, read, and participated in...of which there are many.  Some have been for clubs and educational purposes, while others were for games and still others for random chat.  There are definitely similarities to the F:F:F (not in topic mind).  When something big comes up, the posts really do go &quot;flying&quot; (47).  I have yet to see a forum without some sort of Off Topic section as well.  And of course, the ever-popular flame wars...much like the ones between Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with forums might seem just like having conversations with people in real life, and it is true that the only physical differences are time delay and typing instead of speaking.  However, one thing I notice a lot of the time is that forums tend to bring out the extremes in people.  For some reason (and not totally unexpected), people tend to speak their minds more...oppose and argue with others to a greater degree...create topics that just keep going and going and going and never stop unless someone stops posting...(generally the flame wars, and most of the ones I&#039;ve seen never really get resolved....they just die).  So, perhaps the forum is not an ideal direct parallel to real life conversation...but it does tend to bring out the best and worst in people that one wouldn&#039;t see normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned, its to not get too involved in random forum...because it is sooo easy to spend half a lifetime in them (kinda like Cayce is here).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response for Midnight Robber...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two long essays, a couple other assignments....I really don&#039;t have time for this tonight, so I&#039;ll take my second pass now in hopes that I shouldn&#039;t have a problem doing them the rest of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Parallel &quot;realities&quot; make for some interesting experiences...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/274</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Snow Crash takes a very interesting approach to the future...namely, an evolution of what we&#039;d consider the internet.  However, this web of information is more than just a bunch of pages to look at...its a whole new reality whatsoever, with people interacting, sharing, and doing stuff almost as if it is the real world....with some modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the setup of the Street and The Black Sun bar that Hiro frequents.  The Street itself is basically a hub...information and people gather in great amounts there, and they filter off/leave for sub-streets for various reasons.  The metaphor here of streets implies a distinct parallel to the real world...in fact, could even be called a reality of its own with city streets, and a central &quot;main&quot; street where lots of people gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black Sun is a sorta-typical bar, with the difference being that some of the best hackers in the world hang out there, along with several other important figures.  In a way, it is a parallel to some sort of exclusive night club or bar, and that fact that such a things exists (and has drinks of its own) shows the extent by which this alternate universe has developed.  If you think about it, why would there be a need for drinking where information is exchanged and presented? (and drugs for that matter, like Snow Crash itself).  Our current internet does that decently enough as is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its the differences from reality that kinda make me realize why such unnecessary things exist.  The fact that Hiro wrote the algorithms for sword-fighting....and even DEATH by such combat...shows the level of control hackers like Hiro have over the &quot;reality&quot; of the Metaverse.  In essence, the Metaverse serves as a new world of its own...tailored to the needs and wants of its people to a larger degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me a bit towards some of our discussion in class, primarily Second Life.  This program was brought up because it draws its inspiration from the novel and tries to mimic such an environment.  Out of curiosity, I decided to try a free account just to see what it was about and how close it came/comes to realizing the picture Snow Crash portrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of exploration and messing around, I found it to be quite an experience.  The similarities and parallels to the Metaverse in Snow Crash are quite astounding, and the possibilities look endless.  Perhaps our future might end up this way, as the technology is already there to a degree (and developing).  Granted, something like Second Life would take ages to get to that point....but I&#039;m somewhat thrilled by the thought that it might happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The timeline of Slow River....isn&#039;t really a line...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/243</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As was already shown in class by the presentation, the events of the book Slow River, while mixed up and shown out of order, can be lined up to form the majority of Lore&#039;s life.  Beginning in Chapter 2 when Lore is at the age of 5, and ending with her rejoining her Father again at the end of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on first glance it seemed like these events were just thrown together in random order....in a sort of flashback-y way.  A little rough, but not terribly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out though, a closer inspection reveals what I would call a pattern in the chronology.  Or rather, several patterns that relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, it seems that there are two to three separate time-&quot;lines&quot; going, as the story rotates between Lore&#039;s early life (age 5 to her kidnapping and escape) her time with Spanner (beginning with being taken in from the street and ending with Lore leaving the flat) and her life as Sal Bird.  Although I haven&#039;t taken the time to check in detail, these seem to rotate in a sort of order (usually early, mid, then late) with each section bringing another portion of the particular time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting setup to watch in action, and I found it even more so with the fact that the &quot;sections&quot; started getting relatively shorter and closer to the other time periods.  In my mind, I pictured the three timelines as &quot;strands&quot; of time weaving through space, though they weaved together closer and closer until they finally met in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of an odd way to put it I suppose, but that really is what went through my mind.  That and the fact that I could finally put together the entirety of Lore&#039;s life and thus understand the story a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good read....though I wish a little that we could find out more of what happened in the end, even if it was only a sort of epilogue....&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gattaca......?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/219</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#039;m missing something, but I haven&#039;t seen any topics about Gattaca so far...and its a bit hard to find individual comments about it when there is no tag for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve watched it three times now....twice in the past, and once this week....and I personally find the movie quite engaging to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a particular reason I&#039;m not seeing much discussion for it?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Resistance</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/158</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m about two-thirds of the way through &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; now, and while &quot;Dawn&quot; seemed to focus a bit more on the alien aspect (the Oankali) this second part seems to shift towards the humans, both resister and &quot;trader&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, a majority of the humans of Lilith&#039;s Brood are really not that unusual...they like to build and create, they like their individuality and freedom, and they have their squabbles and disagreements.  The little town of Phoenix is a prime example of this, and it is quite easy to draw parallels to our own societies and history from the descriptions given of this town (Butler 345).  And it is hardly surprising, considering that these people are attempting to restore the old world that they had lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is both surprising and absurd how these people can still refuse to give up their &quot;humanity&quot; as they call it.  Alright, so maybe it seems like the people would be giving up their humanity by going to the Oankali...what with bearing offspring that possess traits of both....and anyone with a bit of sense would be hesitant to trust such a situation.  Really....who would want to completely change the way humanity lives and reproduces at the drop of a hat...no questions asked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it would seem that in &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, choosing humanity over the alien has even worse consequences.  The people of Phoenix are no longer able to reproduce and force themselves to steal or buy stolen children in order to avoid &quot;going with them&quot;.  In such a society, the people are prone to hurting one another...a prime example being when Tino&#039;s parents tear apart Tate&#039;s home to kill the raiders (355).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the people of resister towns such as Phoenix are either slowly dying without hope of offspring or killing each other off over various grievances.  Oddly enough, this draws parallels to the war that started it all....with humans of all sorts killing each other.  In a way, this is the Oankali versus the humans in another war that could tear the world apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder really....wouldn&#039;t these people have learned their lesson already?  I mean, they nearly killed everyone once as it is....why continue on a path that could repeat this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe the answer, while not entirely clear, is something not unfamiliar.  That concept of humanity...the xenophobia that inhabits nearly all human beings to some degree (though we may not express it).....  That fear of the different that causes Lilith so much trouble getting used to Jdahya in the beginning of the trilogy...  Simply because we use appearance as an indication of allegiance, these humans fail to see some of the reason the Oankali put forth (though I will say that I&#039;m still not 100% sure about them).  This same feeling which causes racism and stereotyping....which causes humans of all kinds to make decisions without knowledge or reason.  A terrible thing, but one that we cannot be totally rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have not finished the trilogy, I do not know what this feeling will cause....will all humans eventually accept the Oankali or not?  Guess I&#039;ll find out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>An Interesting Ending to and Interesting Novel...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/127</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Le Guin&#039;s novel seems to be an interesting, if strange, subject -- bisexual individuals -- yet it seems that a majority of the sort of &quot;oddness&quot; that appears is either random differences from humans -- for example, not being able to say the &quot;L&quot; sound (Le Guin 30) -- or in the developing relationship between Genly and Estraven in the later parts of the novel.  Other than that....most of the events and societal customs observed seem either familiar or not very outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the whole gender-neutral aspect seems to be focused on very little...with only random thoughts of Genly to remind a reader that these people are, indeed, alien.  At least how I read the novel, these individuals could easily pass as normal people, and the only defining characteristic that marks the world as alien is the endless cold and snow that permeates nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the way it is described for the beginning of the novel, Gethen is not a very interesting place compared to Earth....and could almost be the same.  As time goes by however, primarily beginning with Genry and Estraven&#039;s journey across the ice, things seem to change.  Suddenly the &quot;interesting&quot; qualities of Estraven are more apparent (what with the two of them alone out there) and for probably the first time it is easily apparent both to Genry and us as readers how alien and different such a characteristic (bisexualism) really is.  While for most of the novel the various people appear as solely male...Estraven slowly but surely shows his feminine side during the times in the tent on the Gobrin ice, especially when he comes to be in kemmer (232).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several chapters of stark contrast, the novel ends similarly to how it began....but the effect of that time the pair spent on the ice is still there, and even Genry notices how much the natives have changed him...seeing his own kind as strange (296).  As a result, even though the topic was avoided for a majority of the novel, the dual feminism and masculinity of the people of Gethen seems all the stranger...yet much more interesting for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Better Protected or More Oppressed?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/94</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously the central issue of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale has to do with the role of women in society, especially in the future, considering how much of a stark contrast there is between the world of today and the world of tomorrow portrayed in Atwood&#039;s novel.  However, to actually quantify and sort out the differences between these two situations takes a bit more thought and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we could easily catalogue the concrete changes: women cannot own property or have a job, and are thus basically restricted to the home...either as a servant, a wife, or a handmaid (in coarser terms, a baby factory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand are the implications that some of these changes have had on the role of women.  However, I think that the way women have taken the change...and how they feel about their places....is probably the most important topic here, because the novel can easily be interpreted differently depending on how the people involved accept things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime example: Offred.  As a handmaid whose sole purpose in society is to reproduce, it would seem to us that she as a person has been desecrated by the established regime.  In our eyes, she is basically used by people of power around here simply for the &quot;gift&quot; she has (if one can call it such), her ability to reproduce.  For anyone with an ounce of morality, this situation just seems wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is the accepted norm for everyone....even for the handmaids themselves it seems.  Or at least, the established society would make one believe so.... However, Offred tells us in subtle ways that perhaps things are not so beneficial.  She continually has thoughts of the &quot;old days&quot; back with her husband Luke, when she had freedom, despite never outright saying she wished better for herself.  ....Until, that is, Ofglen steps across the line, clearing stating her rebellion on page 168, and it is obvious that Offred agrees with Ofglen fully....and not just a passing &quot;Wish things were better&quot; attitude that appeared in earlier chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, it seems that at least some of the women do not enjoy the change in role.  Considering that the structure of society is advertised as being safer and better protective for women, it is ironic that the same structure would put them into an even worse form of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that the society IS optimal considering the circumstances...but to me it does not appear that much, if any, benefit has come from the differences in Atwood&#039;s novel.  One would hope (and probably assume) that her intention for writing it was to promote gender equality or at least freedom...and not captivity as Offred experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So apparently, I made a mistake on the first response and made it a comment under my test entry instead of a blog entry...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in case it got missed last week....it&#039;s still there as the one comment to my test post.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gibson&#039;s Mysteries</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/61</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the oddest books I have read...Neuromancer was a swirling melting pot of futuristic visions and stereotypes, having connotations in the area of future politics, the role of women, and the overall predictions for the future world.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I found that the novel caused me to ask more questions than it attempted to answer...the first off being what Linda&#039;s role is supposed to be not only in the context of the book, but also in Wintermute/Neuromancer&#039;s plot.  I could sense the obvious connection Case had with her, but I really couldn&#039;t tell how truly attached he was to her from the start.  Certainly he could have had a nice life with her, but was that actually in his mind beforehand?  Did he ever intend to &quot;get together&quot; with her?  And even more puzzling is how her face popping up now and again seems to haunt him, despite little evidence that Case was really attracted to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More puzzling to me were the actions of the AI&#039;s, as even after reading it and skimming over the book again...I can&#039;t understand what the motives were of Wintermute and what the intended results were.  I suppose these were intended to be....sort of...beyond our knowledge as humans, but it still leaves me hanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good read, but it&#039;s left my mind swirling for quite a while with the mysteries it leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
