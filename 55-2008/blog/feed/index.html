 <description>&lt;p&gt;What should we read this summer?&lt;br /&gt;
(e.g. if you liked Starship Troopers, you should read the Foundation series by Asimov)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>One last response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/367</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Contains season 2 spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my last shot at extra credit, though BSG is still fresh and new enough in my mind that I&#039;m pretty hesitant to dissect it.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen three texts so far this semester that deal with the almost total extinction of the human race.  Of the three, to me it seems that Battlestar Galactica presents the best case that the humans are worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;
In Xenogenesis the resisters fight for the preservation of humanity, but the version of humanity they represent really doesn&#039;t seem worth preserving.  They exhibit violence and racism. They turn on even the other humans, raid their camps and steal their women.  Some of them refuse to fraternize with humans of different skin tones, even when there are so few humans left at all.  In Oryx and Crake the humans also seemed beyond redemption.  They had reached new lows in depravity, in science (the ChickieNobs &quot;chickens&quot;) and recreation (Crake and Jimmy&#039;s internet hotspots).&lt;br /&gt;
	Battlestar Galactica is the first time that we seem (a non-mad-scientist) human really realize the flaws within the human race, and come to the conclusion that we might not be worth saving.  And yet I think that it&#039;s the most hopeful in that respect of the three texts.  The survivors are generally speaking pretty likable, more so than the resisters in Xenogenesis and Oryx and Crake&#039;s Snowman.  I&#039;m only partway through season two, so I don&#039;t have a fully developed picture of the Pegasus crew yet, but so far they really reinforce just how likeable the other humans are.  They serve as a foil for the Galactica crew in multiple ways.  They show just how little the Galactica crew uphold the hierarchical aspect of human nature.  As military establishments go Galactica&#039;s is very relaxed.  They are less robotic, and more human, as D&#039;anna Biers pointed out in her documentary.  The Pegasus crew&#039;s disturbing nonchalance toward the abuse of the 6 aboard their ship also shows just how little the Galactica crew members give in to typical military machismo.&lt;br /&gt;
	It also seems that the humans can be taught acceptance and understanding.  For all the 6&#039;s claim that Gaius isn&#039;t really a (human) man until he has killed, the trend in the show is more toward acceptance than destruction.  Helo completely accepts his love for Sharon.  He looks forward to her bearing their hybrid child.  Then in an ultimate act of loyalty, he and the chief kill for her.  Even Gaius honestly seems to love his 6.  Though admittedly most of his professions of love stem ultimately from his ongoing instinct for self-preservation rather than an expression of any conscious feeling, he&#039;s on the verge of tears when he sees her in pain aboard the Pegasus.  The people who do mistreat the Cylons are the &quot;bad&quot; humans: Case, Thorne, the crew members of the Pegasus.&lt;br /&gt;
	Though the humans in BSG are clearly not in the midst of a utopian society, the series seems to present the idea that if given a second chance, they might be able to establish a functional relatively accepting society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Am I the only one...?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/366</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one in class who does not like BSG? I have made it through the miniseries and first half of the first season and just can&#039;t seem to feel any interest in the happenings of the show or the lives of the characters. Frankly, I don&#039;t really care what happens and find it all rather boring. Perhaps I am just shallow, but there is something about the whole political-drama-in-space thing that really puts me off when it comes to SF TV and movies. I&#039;ve always liked comedic stuff with lots of space battles and explosions!!!  Action-adventurey shows I supposeâ€¦ Indiana Jones in space! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&#039;t have any particular reason for this weird double-standard about SF TV (which I didn&#039;t even realize I had until trying to watch BSG). I&#039;m sure I am now going to be eaten alive for not appreciating this and that and all the intricacies of the show and whatnot, but I don&#039;t think I am going to be getting over this double-standard anytime soon.  So I was just curious as to if there is anyone else who isn&#039;t enjoying BSG thus far and if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Just watched the Miniseries</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/365</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished the Battlestar Galactica miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I am extremely sad I hadn&#039;t found this show earlier, as I would have been watching it the whole time.  It really is a great science fiction epic.  The little touches make it seem far more real than straight space westerns do.  There is less sound in space than in other parts of the show, which is gotten wrong by almost every space media.  However, there is still some sound, which I see as a nod to the fact that without it the show would be boring.  The ships seem more realistic than the regular star fighters in most shows.  While they do still have shapes that seem better suited for air than space, they at least have jets on every side of them so that they can maneuver more easily and correctly in space.  Battlestar has so far been far better at showing inertia in space, and not making ships stop instantly whenever they want to or their engines fail.  The situation where the mark VII vipers lost power against the cylons was great because of that fact, that the ships kept moving forward even after their engines stopped.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts of Battlestar that I really liked were the flaws in so many characters.  While it seems requisite to include flaws in your characters, Battlestar has so far seemed to create realistic ones.  Adama isn&#039;t perfect, but he listens to reason.  He drove his son away with his high expectations, but he is willing to make amends.  Roslin is an extremely interesting character.  She has steel in her that seems out of place, until you realize that it comes from her cancer.  She knows she will die, so she is free to make difficult decisions, especially the one where she abandons the sub light craft to make sure the FTL craft can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbuck reminded me greatly of Tank Girl.  Their personalities seemed very similar, especially when Starbuck was fighting and flying.  Anyone else get that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I trail off a little towards the end, but I want to watch more Battlestar, so more thoughts in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Problems with race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/364</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, the representations of gender in the show are pretty sophisticated, I was impressed in that respect.  I&#039;m much less impressed with their treatment of race.  In particular, why are all the most religious characters black?  I&#039;m delving a little into the beginning of season two here, but there&#039;s Roslin&#039;s (spiritual?) adviser (the one who realizes the importance of the 12 serpents),  her guard in the brig, and the quorum member from Gemenon.  It makes me a little uncomfortable...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>oryx and crake vs. handmaid&#039;s tale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/362</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since both of these novels are by Atwood, I immediately began noticing similarities (and more often, differences) between them when I started reading Oryx and Crake. The two greatest similarities seem to be: the meandering narrative style, which is not my personal cup of tea but is certainly better than being dry and dull; and the overall dystopian viewpoints of the books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Handmaid&#039;s Tale, religious extremism is the big &quot;Thing&quot; that has moved the world from contentment into despair; and the most destructive product of that fanaticism is the subjugation of women. In Oryx and Crake, it seems that scientific development is the big evil at first; but when you look below the surface I think it&#039;s really corporate control OF science that it&#039;s trying to criticize. The Crakers themselves, with their &quot;perfected&quot; human genetic composition and general plasticity, seem to be the biggest example of this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crake is a negative personification of the ideal of progress...or rather he is what happens when someone gets too strongly behind the idea of always moving forward. While walking around Watson-Crick, he keeps pointing out different technologies and saying &quot;wave of the future&quot; or &quot;the latest&quot;I found it so interesting that Crake is also basically programmed with a disrespect for life by playing violent video games, watching live executions, and another called &quot;Extinctathon&quot;, which while it doesn&#039;t directly contribute to mistreating the environment, perhaps encourages it? Yet, I didn&#039;t find myself hating Crake; rather feeling intimidated that he is the future of our planet...the progress-blinded, drunk-on-technology non-human with no respect for the earth, or no need for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose one could notice that both novels are decidedly heterosexual, and do not really explore non-traditional gender relations, but sticking to a few strong topics almost makes Atwood&#039;s critiques more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Battlestar</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/361</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gawker, the king blog for sarcastic, jaded 20-somethings, adores Battlestar Galactica in a way I thought impossible for a bunch of bloggers so mired in their own ironic-ness.  Anyway, their recaps of its goings-on are hilarious, or at least I think they are hilarious.  If anyone is interested:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Evolution</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/360</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to discuss the significance of Crake&#039;s decisions on how to modify humanity.  It seems to me that, while his modifications were aimed at eliminating strife, the main result of his modifications were that he eliminated the part of humanity which causes strife, the main things he did was to eliminate the human capacity for progress.  This emerges in his discussion with Jimmy about sex.  Jimmy argues that by eliminating sexual frustration, he is eliminating art.  I think this actually applies to nearly all human endeavors, including government, science, commerce, etc.  Crake even confirms this indirectly by saying something like, wouldn&#039;t you always rather be fucking?  He ultimately implies that if there wasn&#039;t a sexual urge to make yourself more attractive, you wouldn&#039;t do it, and art, and by extension all other human endeavors I mentioned, wouldn&#039;t be made.  By limiting this capacity of humanity, it seems that he is dooming humanity to the same fate as the rest of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Military Question</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/359</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a embarrassing revealing of my lack of knowledge on the workings of the military, but does our military use &quot;sir&quot; to address women in command?  Or is that a convention invented for the show?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Religion is frustratingly necessary</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/358</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crake constructs a new genetically engineered human race to live more &quot;in harmony&quot; with the earth and each other by removing the human propensity for violence, meat-eating, religion, etc. etc.  Unfortunately, a lot of those are a more intrinsic to the human makeup than Crake originally guessed.  The Crakers are alone, in a world they can no  longer understand now that Crake has taken science away from them.  The only connection they have with the old world is Snowman, so naturally they go to him for answers.  Snowman becomes their guru, their demigod, who in turn raises Oryx and Crake to the status of gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake, through Snowman, provide a greater truth and reason for the Crakers than they can access with their own senses.  The three members of the old human race can answer questions for the new ones.  It is a natural, essential part of any conscious being, this need to find these answers.  I remember reading a Newsweek cover story when I was in high school â€“ which was apparently a long time ago, because I can&#039;t find the article anywhere on the Internet â€“ on the theory that the need for religion is hard-wired into our genes.  We can&#039;t help but want to believe in a greater power, though in the modern age that &quot;greater power&quot; can be science, as well as a god/dess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I suppose that the above claim is a hard one to prove, given that the only (proven) conscious beings we know about are us, and having a sample size of one is not a particularly accurate way of drawing conclusions.  However, a being that does not want to find answers to the unknowable world around it cannot possess curiosity, and a being without curiosity will not learn and will not have any new thoughts, and a being that does not think and learn can hardly be conscious.  So, as someone said in class yesterday, the only way Crake could have defeated the need for religion would have been to replace humans with a new race of monkeys.  So, conscious beings need answers. Since the Crakers do not have hard science to provide these answers for them, they have to start back where the ancients did â€“ with creation stories, fables, and myths, a primitive religion constructed around father and mother deities, Crake and Oryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, religion comes along with a whole bundle of less savory things, as history has proven time and time again.  The Crakers will become more passionate about their deities.  As the religion becomes more and more complex, discrepancies will arise (look at how simple the original difference between the Sunnis and the Shi&#039;ites was), which will lead to argument, which because of the passion behind it will lead to hate, which will lead to war, with which comes the need to construct a hierarchy (someone has to win, which means that a whole bunch of someones will be better than a whole bunch of other someones).  And, we&#039;re back where we started, basically, except now there are a whole bunch of little herbivores running around destroying each other, and the world with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy&#039;s life pre-apocalypse serves as a way to remind us of how difficult, how impossible, it is to live without some kind of higher power to look up to.  For a child, their parents are the end-all, be-all â€“ I know when I was a kid, at least, whatever my father said was absolute truth, and anyone who said otherwise could go suck it.  (I don&#039;t think I would have phrased it in exactly that way when I was seven, however.)  Jimmy&#039;s parents are too transparently flawed for Jimmy to be able to look up to them, to be comforted in the knowledge that they are looking out for him and protecting him always.  The accounts of his early childhood are saturated with pervasive feeling of loneliness, reminding the reader of how natural that need is, and how desolate it feels to be without it.  When the childlike Crakers ask Snowman for answers, therefore, it is all the more understandable for the reader.  It&#039;s nice to feel like there&#039;s some sort of reason and plan behind all this nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I hope that grace days count for the blog, too, because I totally used mine for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>oryx and crake response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/357</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For my Oryx and Crake presentation, I focused on how I saw Oryx and Crake to be like an updated version of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and I wanted to go further in depth on this topic for my reader response. Some of this is kind of rehashing what I said earlier, so I apologize for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading Oryx and Crake, I kept thinking back to The Handmaid&#039;s Tale. I haven&#039;t read any Margaret Atwood novels besides these two, so I&#039;m not sure if the similarities I saw between the two novels are actually trademark Atwood devices that she uses in all her novels, but I felt that there were some pretty significant similarities that tied the two novels together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that jumped out at me was how both stories used the same narrative style. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, Offred, the main character, is currently in the future and spends the story both retelling her past and describing her present circumstances. In Oryx and Crake, Snowman, the main characterâ€¦is currently in some future world and reminisces about his past while trying to survive in his current world. Both books use sort of a nonlinear structure to slowly unravel aspects of the story. In both cases, the reader initially does not know how the future world came about â€“ this, along with background story on the main character, are slowly revealed through flashbacks. This nonlinear method of storytelling is a pretty jarring aspect of both novels and introduced intriguing dimensions to the story. It is interesting to first meet Snowman when he is in his adult years and then read about how his character developed through his flashbacks; the same goes for Offred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other significant similarity is the concept of both novels. In both stories, the main characters are set in a future world in which something terrible has happened to humanity. Atwood tried in both cases to make the formation of this future world as believable as possible. Of course, the future world itself of Oryx and Crake will seem extremely outlandish, but the characters behind this future catastrophe and the events that transpire all seem to be very rooted in reality. What Atwood does in both novels is analyze the current state of the world at the time that she&#039;s writing the book and then try to make logical extrapolations from that current world. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, we see a corrupt government take over Offred&#039;s country and then transform it into a dystopian, totalitarian regime. This is a timeless concept, as the idea of a corrupt government laying waste to a country has been used constantly throughout literary history. The agent of destruction in Oryx and Crake, however, is biotechnology, which is why I see it as an updated version of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale. Once again, Atwood is analyzing the current state of the world at the time that she&#039;s writing the novel and speculating about where humanity could go from here with what it has. Technology has advanced significantly since the writing of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and with the advent of biotechnology, humanity now has even more ways to screw itself up, which is what Atwood explores in Oryx and Crake. The future world of Oryx and Crake is much more dire than that of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale because we are led to believe that humanity has simply been wiped out rather than subjected to a totalitarian government, reflecting the higher stakes of today&#039;s world. Thus, in the end, I saw Oryx and Crake as Atwood returning once again to analyze the world and give us her take on what we currently have and where we could go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pigoon Platoon... a last minute response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/356</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this response has nothing to do with pigoon platoons (although that bit where they trapped Snowman in the guardhouse was a bit unnerving) it just seemed catchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I actually want to discuss is sort of a response to a comment made in class (I think). I seem to recall someone mentioning something about Snowman being able to handle the whole apocalypse situation oddly well and the more I thought about it the more I started to think he wasn&#039;t really handling it that well at all. From the beginning we know that he is hearing voices which aren&#039;t even Oryx, for &quot;Oryx is no longer very talkative&quot; (11). He hates these voices and is staring to behave like the &quot;crazed lice-infested hermits in their caves and deserts&quot; who used to also hear such voices (11). When it comes to alcohol &quot;his impulse (is) to drink it up as fast as possible, turn all memory to white noise,&quot; not exactly the frame of mind of someone who is handling a situation well so much as making do in a pretty horrific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does at times seem to be taking good care of the Crakers, or at least not abandoning them. My thoughts about that are because he sees so much of Oryx in them. They have that innocence that she had and because of her connection to them I think it would be very hard for him to just leave them to their own devices. They also give him something to do. As was pointed out, he basically made his living just making things up and now is doing exactly the same thing and also learning from it. They also keep him company as best any living thing can at this point and he is afraid to &quot;lose his audience&quot; and that &quot;they&#039;d turn their backs on him, they&#039;d wander away&quot; (104). He needs some contact and has to make do with them even though they cannot understand so much and their questions can be frustrating at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also isn&#039;t doing well physically. The food he eats seems to come primarily from cans of left over from before and filled with such tasty things as &quot;SoyOBoy wieners&quot; and &quot;Sveltana No-Meat Cocktail Sausages.&quot; He doesn&#039;t hunt anything or even fish, and only gets this fish from the Crakers who bring it to him once a week. He looks for mirrors whenever he cans and what is sees is &quot;Increasingly â€¦ a shock. A stranger stares back at him, bleary-eyed, hollow-cheeked, pocked with bug-bite scabs. He looks twenty years older than he is&quot; (231).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that he is more a man who is making do as best he can, although there are probably people who could have done much better than he is. For instance, the humans he almost meets at the very end are at least cooking for themselves. Just some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>mythologizing SF in o&amp;c</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/355</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The author of an article I read for my term paper writes that SF and myths operate similarly.  Both are a reflection of man&#039;s thirst for knowledge about his origins and his fate; SF is considered a more self-conscious form of myth-making.  This is especially prevalent in Oryx &amp;amp; Crake, during those instances when the Children of Crake ask Snowman to tell them creation stories.  Oryx and Crake are likened to Godlike beings: &quot;Crake made the bones of the Children of Crake out of the coral on the beach, and then he made their flesh out of a mango.  But the Children of Oryx hatched out of an egg, a giant egg laid by Oryx herself&quot; (96).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowman, in this story, represents the last remnants of mankind, though at times, he loses sense of who and what he is/was.  I thought it was interesting that the female Children of Crake were disturbing to Snowman.  &quot;They&#039;re every known colour from deepest black to whitest white...each one of them is admirably proportioned.  Each is sound of tooth, smooth of skin.  No ripples of fat around their waists, no bulges, no dimpled orange-skin cellulite on their thighs...They look like retouched fashion photos&quot; (100).  In other words, these women are &quot;perfect.&quot;  Despite their perfection, Snowman does not find them sexually attractive.  As cliche as this may be, flaws individualize people and make them special; imperfection gives more personality to a face than perfect symmetry does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These women are too perfect.  &quot;These new women are neither lopsided nor sad: they&#039;re placid, like animated statues&quot; (100).  The Children of Crake are too well created for this post-apocalyptic environment.  They may look human, but they aren&#039;t human.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Crake: The Ultimate Environmentalist?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/354</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crake succeeded in saving the environment of Earth.  By killing all humans and replacing them with a species specifically designed not to get out of control and expand further than sufficiency, Crake did the best possible thing he could for the environment.  Obviously, there are only a few humans who would agree that extinction and replacement is the way to save the earth, but one cannot deny that in terms of effectiveness of the measure, Crake&#039;s plan was the best.  Humans in any form do not have the restraint to refrain from expanding to the point where they harm the environment, according to Crake, and this could never change.  The solution to the problem is surprisingly similar to several voluntary extinction programs that believe that humans should allow themselves to die off.  Few are advocating killing everyone off, but that is what happens when you get a mad scientist.  Crakers as a species are also a great environmentally conscious race because of their eating habits.  They are completely vegetarian so they do not have to kill off any animals.  They eat parts of plants that are hard to digest and so they don&#039;t have to farm food for themselves the same way humans do, and they do not cook food so they do not have to make large fires and cooking methods in order to eat.  This makes Crakers &#039;in tune&quot; with nature.  Thus, Crake was the ultimate Environmentalist.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Different Post-Apocalyptic Lifestyle</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/353</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While Snowman, as many people have pointed out, has a very grim life ahead of him, I found James Cole&#039;s life in 12 Monkeys considerably more disturbing. He experiences just about everything that could go wrong in a dystopian future: his life is manipulated by far more powerful people, he loses his grip on what is real and believes himself to be insane, and ultimately becomes a witness to his own death. As with many time-travelers, he is ultimately helpless in the past even though he has such extensive knowledge of it; Cole&#039;s story employs the Cassandra myth to find tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tragedy of the film occurs when Cole realizes that his recurring dream is linked to his childhood, and that as a child he witnessed his own death at the airport. Here, even his personal memory of the past has failed him, and his life takes on a sort-of ouroboros configuration, where his final moments are taken in by his childhood-self, who will then go on to perform exactly the same actions decades later that will place him in the airport again. As finales go in time-travel movies, I think this is one of the most effective and disturbing tragedies possible; while time-travel movies may end up with the hero having to sacrifice himself to maintain the timeline (e.g. Donnie Darko, Terminator 2), here the character condemns his life to an endless cycle of helplessness and tragedy. We naturally think of time as linear, which is what makes time-travel movies such fun escapism; when the hero dies at the end, in some ways this returns us to a linear conception of their timeline, with a definite beginning and end. Here, Cole does not leave us with this satisfaction, and the murkiness of his timeline (and sanity and top of that) is unsettling, effective, and a unique comment on time-travel&#039;s complex effect on the lives of its users.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>terrible humanity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/352</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What ended up sticking out to me most while reading Oryx and Crake was how little good was attributed to the human race (&quot;homo sapiens sapiens&quot; [Atwood 99]). It was rather strange that despite hearing the story from a human&#039;s point of view, from Snowman&#039;s reflections on the past, the reader is presented with quite a terrible view of humanity. One of the first things that was mentioned was about one of the questionable games Jimmy and Crake would play: Blood and Roses, Blood representing the terrible deeds people have done in the past and Roses representing human achievements, like literature. But as Jimmy points out, &quot;it was easier to remember the Blood stuff&quot; (80) This could be because humans have a tendency toward remembering shocking things, violent things, atrocious things more than mild and pleasing things. Alternatively, it could be because there truly have been more Blood events in history than Rose events. In either case, humanity is not represented in a very appealing light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, there are all the sites Jimmy and Crake surf amongst for entertainment when they are still teenagers: the &quot;Noodie News&quot; (81), &quot;Felicia&#039;s Frog Squash,&quot; &quot;hedsoff.com,&quot; &quot;alibooboo.com&quot; (82), &quot;shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and deathrowlive.com,&quot; and &quot;nitee-nite.com&quot; (83). The Noodie News is just kind of silly, with all the news reporters reporting while naked, but the other sites are not very pleasant. Felicia&#039;s Frog Squash is about exactly what it sounds like, and it is not alone it its type. Even more gruesome are hedsoff.com and alibooboo.com, where one can watch live executions and stonings from Asia and the Middle East. Similar sites representative of America are shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and deathrowlive.com, where, strangely, the men getting executed make a big show for the known viewers while the few women are killed in a very solemn affair, as if reminding everyone else that this punishment should not be entertainment. But the website that takes the cake, as it were, for showing how ridiculous people are is nitee-nite.com, where Jimmy and Crake can watch assisted suicides. The event is turned into a grand affair, and Snowman later reflects that &quot;killing yourself was something you did for an audience,&quot; and if he did it now, with no one around to see, the act would be without &quot;elegance&quot; (344). Since when is suicide an elegant affair? The ease with which movies are made and uploaded onto the Web seems to have prompted everyone to go after their fifteen minutes of fame--sometimes in less thoughtful ways. Using suicide as a way to finally get noticed seems to go quite against the point, and truly all of these sites portray the rather shallow side of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Crake is not shocked at this, and himself views humanity with not a little contempt. &quot;Monkey paws, monkey curiosity, the desire to take apart, turn inside out, smell, fondle, measure, improve, trash, discard--all hooked up to monkey brains, an advanced model of monkey brains but monkey brains all the same&quot; (99). While great minds of the past have often raised humanity on a pedestal above all other animals, Crake has a more cynical, and probably more realistic view of human capabilities. Our being basically monkeys is not necessarily a bad thing, though it is a blow to our ego to think that we&#039;re no better than animals when as a society we have believed this for quite a while. But Crake doesn&#039;t stop here; he sees so many imperfections and unnecessary evils in humans that he believes will soon destroy us that he creates an entirely new species that is so much better. Gone is hierarchy, religion, all the bad that has ever surrounded sex. Many of Crake&#039;s instructions to Jimmy/Snowman about taking care of the Crakers include watching out for emerging human traits, like developing art and symbols, because these are supposedly a sign of evil to come. Truly, I think this depressing view of humanity is encapsulated in poor Snowman&#039;s thought when describing his name: &quot;He&#039;s kept the abominable to himself&quot; (8). He feels that while he teaches the Crakers, he must keep his central human-ness away from them and not influence them to become just like the race that Crake had so despised.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Isn&#039;t Crake a Savior?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/351</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Crake believes that in order for the human race to survive, it has to become essentially non-human. He is doing what he believes is necessary to save what he considers to be the best parts of humanity. Barring the methods by which he achieves it, I think that it is interesting to examine this motivation as it stands, outside of the context. Personally, I do not agree with what Crake considers to be the best parts of humanity, just as I don&#039;t agree with Butler&#039;s argument that the &quot;hierarchical impulse&quot; is entirely bad. Just like Butler would remove this impulse, Crake removes the qualities that make the crakers able to joke â€“ &quot;For jokes you need a certain edge, a certain malice&quot; (306).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, I don&#039;t think that human ambition is a bad thing. Ambition is what has allowed us to pull ourselves out of lives that, no matter how idealized, were still nasty, brutish and short. Ambition is what has given us all the technology, all the power over the natural world that we now enjoy. Ambition requires self-interest, it requires that little bit of malice that makes jokes possible. I don&#039;t think that we are human without ambition, and I think that the most damage that Crake inflicts upon the idea of Humanity in the Crakers is his removal of the entirety of their ambition. They don&#039;t want anything more than what they have. With that attitude, what will they ever create?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the question becomes: Is Crake&#039;s way the only way for the human race to survive? Is there something inherently suicidal about the way that we act? I believe that Crake saw it this way, and was tormented by his vision, even if he would not admit it to himself. When Jimmy visits him at Watson and Crick, he hears the dreams that Crake has every night, and the terror that this inflicts upon him (218). I think that this scene brings (ironically) a real humanity to Crake. He is struggling with his decision, whether he wants to admit it or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crake, in the end, is not more than human. His creations are not perfect, no matter how far from human he has pushed them. By the end of the novel, they have created an effigy of Sandman, and are thus implied to be on the way back to humanity (361). Crake&#039;s last gesture is not godly, or superhuman, but simply another act of hubris, assuming that he can distill humanity into its most perfect parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this idea is central to why it is difficult to classify him as good or evil. We know that we are imperfect, as part of the human condition. Improving upon this condition must be something noble. If it assists in our ability to survive, and it can be applied to the entirety of humanity in one fell swoop, then isn&#039;t Crake a savior? This impulse conflicts with our ideas about making fundamental changes to our humanity in order to survive. Is it worth it? Is there something intrinsically noble about the human condition as it stands that should not be modified, no matter the benefits? Even if we pull Crake&#039;s decision out of the necessity for the eradication of all living humans, it is still an impossible decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ChickieNobs, PETA, and Crake.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/350</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Crake is an extremely interesting character in the novel, even more so after the discussion we had in class about him being a mad scientist/super genius.  Personally, I think he is a mad scientist, because he took the route that, in his view, promotes &#039;the greater good&#039;, with the end justifying the means.  But past this, I think what he did is something that anyone is capable of doing, given the circumstances.  He is extremely intelligent, and gets the best education; he has the drive to see his projects through, and develops the ego necessary to completely believe in his vision.  What I want to know though, it how he developed both the lack of empathy he shows towards not only the animals he experiments on, but also the countless people he kills as well.  It is this lack of care that places him beyond the usual clichÃ© of the scientist mistreating the animals he or she is experimenting on; he obviously cares for the planet.  His whole mission is to stop the pollution, influence, etc., that he thinks humans continue to cause just by existing.&lt;br /&gt;
	I remember it being brought up in class that PETA is offering a reward for anyone who can create a Petri-grown chicken substitute; perhaps this is the view that Crake takes, especially in regard to the ChickieNobs.  If I remember, he says it is easier to just imagine them as sea anemones.  Since they are not &#039;real&#039; animals, they do not deserve the same protections as animals.  On a side note, I wonder about how PETA will react to large-scale, perfect-genotype cloning, if we even get that far.  Will they offer the same protections to these animals (since they are animals in every since except their conception) as they do to &#039;normal&#039; animals?  If anyone knows, I would like to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;
	But back to ChickieNobs, with the disgust and revulsion I feel for the ChickieNobs organisms, I wonder if I could justify killing them.  This is too similar to the stance Crake takes; could I kill these things for the greater good, for their own good, without any way of getting their own opinions?  I still think Crake is at fault for being a part of their creation, but I think we have to be careful in condemning him and undoing his work, as we may end up being just as arrogant as he in thinking we are justified in killing them.  They are alive, if not completely sentient, and we harvest their products at constant detriment to themselves, (though the same things can be said about honeybees.  It is a tricky subject to approach, and one just can&#039;t say, &quot;Better they were never created at all,&quot; since it is all to easy to say that, by the amount of destruction and mayhem humanity has caused throughout its existence, we deserve the same fate.  Perhaps this is where Crake go this idea in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Oryx and Crake...Apocalypse or Rebirth?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/349</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The central event for the novel Oryx in Crake is the advent of a mega-virus, named JUVE, which nearly completely obliterates the human population.  All that remains after it sweeps the world are Snowman, aka Jimmy, and a bunch of &quot;Crakes&quot;...genetically engineered humans designed to live easily and peacefully.  Oh, and apparently some other humans...but we don&#039;t find that out till the end (and book doesn&#039;t say much about them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, the novel is divided into two distinct parts -- before and after this apocalypse respectively -- that are interwoven together such that we alternate between the past and the present Jimmy/Snowman.  The &quot;before&quot; period shows Jimmy&#039;s life and work with Crake up until the virus, and the &quot;after&quot; Jimmy&#039;s (now called Snowman) life as the only surviving regular human (so he believes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description aside, one of the more interesting aspects of this event is the fact that a new species of humans comes out of it nearly alone.  These Crakes are an interesting sort, and before the catastrophe were intended just to be models of how humans could be improved...and become self sufficient.  However, Crake himself apparently had other ideas in mind and intentionally killed off pretty much all of the world&#039;s population in what appears to be an attempt to restart the human race...hence making the Crakes immune to his virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question now: did he succeed in his aims?  From what I can tell, Crake had some sort of conviction to fix the way humans lived and interacted with the environment.  He viewed the current human society as wasteful, destructive, and violent....and he wished to change those tendencies.  Case in point, the Crakes.  Totally docile, self sufficient, and easily adaptable...these new &quot;humans&quot; were his attempt to create a perfect sort of race that could live in harmony forever.  His virus was the method by which to remove the flawed humans to give way for new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did it have the desired effect?  Personally, I would say yes....and no.  Yes, he did eradicate nearly all humans and created a self-sufficient peaceful group of humans.  Yes, his plans fell into place as he expected.  NO, because of Snowman.  Much as Snowman is only one human and will not reproduce...he still exists to propagate the old human way.  He is still an influence on the Crakes, teaching them random things that they would otherwise not care for.  Snowman&#039;s recollections and descriptions of the Crakes contrast jarringly...showing just how simple and almost animalistic they are.  Perhaps this was the idea, but one could argue that this demeans humanity more than it improves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll put this simply.  While Crake may have removed many of the flaws inherent to humans, he also removed most (if not all) of the things that make them truly human.  Sure, they can talk and be curious about things...but will they ever discover, design, invent, be creative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have intelligence, but because of Crake it is put to no use.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The World According to Asperger&#039;s</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/348</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crake&#039;s placement at &quot;Asperger&#039;s U&quot; naturally begs the question of whether or not Atwood was implying that Crake had Asperger&#039;s Syndrome.  Looking at Crake&#039;s mental offspring, I believe the answer to be &quot;yes.&quot;  While Crake&#039;s genetic modifications of humans into Crakers was ostensibly aimed at eliminating traits that would lead to long-term self-destruction or adding traits that increased survivability against wolvogs and the like, there seems to be another element.  Crake appears to have created a society in which the more subtle nuances of human communication are no longer used.&lt;br /&gt;
	When Snowman first speaks to the Crakers, we find that they are completely blunt.  &quot;From an ordinary man Jimmy would have found it brusque, even aggressive, but these people didn&#039;t go in for fancy language: they hadn&#039;t been taught evasion, euphemist, lily-gilding.  Their interactions are similarly simplified whenever we encounter them.  Their mating ritual is structured such that its rules are completely clear, and can be described with perfect accuracy.  The structure eliminates jealousy, but if Crake and his team could ensure that no jealousy existed after the ritual, they could also have ensured a lack of jealousy within various monogamy or polyamory based structures.  What he&#039;s done is to create a society with as few individualized relationship, and thus as little need to build them through interaction, as possible.  On one level, it&#039;s like Aperger&#039;s paradise.&lt;br /&gt;
	On the other hand, the trade-off of Asperger&#039;s as presented by Atwood is the focus available for continued intellectual pursuits.  In this new world, where a life&#039;s academic exploration is necessarily short, and most of the modes in which it could be pursued have been destroyed, walking this far down the Asperger&#039;s path seems rather unnecessary.  Perhaps Crake created his children in his image for the same reasons that anyone reproduces biologically, and this part of his plan had less to do with utility (for he seemed to know that he wouldn&#039;t see this bright new world of his), and more to do with a fundamental need to see one&#039;s self placed within the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>jimmy/snowman&#039;s dependency on oryx</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/346</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Snowman is one of the most heartbreaking characters I have encountered in fiction.  Within the first few chapters, with no knowledge of Snowman&#039;s history or even personality, I felt such pity for him.  He can do nothing but waste away in his loneliness and gloom.  While the character of Jimmy is hardly a vision of integrity, he is a good person.  He is a confused, insecure man whose soul has been scarred since the day his mother disappeared.  Considering Jimmy&#039;s fascination with words, I found it interesting that his memory of his mother&#039;s good-bye note consists of little more than blah, blah, blah.  It is simply too painful for him to articulate the pain he experienced when his mother abandoned him.  He constantly wants Oryx to verbally articulate her traumas and yet he is unwilling to come to grips with his own.  Yes, he uses the story of his mother as a tool to land girls but his scornful apathy towards the incident is indicative of his buried pain.  Not to psychoanalyze Jimmy too much, but his issues with commitment must somewhat stem from the fact that the most important woman in his life left him with nothing but a note.  Jimmy may act as though he does not need his mother but she continually appears in the story long after her physical departure.  There is of course something to be said about the fact that the final words that run through Snowman&#039;s head before heading down to the beach are those of Oryx and his mother.  Oryx says, &quot;Oh Jimmy you were so funny.&quot;  His mother&#039;s voice reiterates what she had said to him in the video: &quot;Don&#039;t let me down.&quot;  This command is symbolic of what Snowman understands to be his relationship with his mother.  Even though this is never actually written, it is inevitable that Jimmy feels somewhat culpable for his mother&#039;s departure.  He disappointed her and never earned the chance to redeem himself.&lt;br /&gt;
	   Jimmy tries to replace this void with Oryx.  Here is where I feel as though Snowman is not an entirely reliable narrator.  Due to the lack of a maternal presence in his life, Jimmy quickly clings onto Oryx, who naturally invokes a motherly persona.  She is brought on to Crake&#039;s project to essentially raise the Crakers and Jimmy ends up needing her to take care of him as well.  In many ways, Jimmy projects his insecurities onto Oryx.  &quot;There was Crake&#039;s story about her, and Jimmy&#039;s story about her as well, a more romantic version; and then there was her own story about herself, which was different from both and not very romantic at all&quot; (114).  Jimmy desperately needs Oryx to be a certain way so he creates his own image of her.  He wants her to be this broken person that he can repair when in reality, he is the one who needs to be mended. I don&#039;t know if Jimmy actually ever loved Oryx; it is obvious he was fixated with her but did this have more to do with the actual Oryx or Jimmy&#039;s emotional problems?  Perhaps the saddest part about the story of Jimmy and Oryx is that I doubt Oryx every truly cared for Jimmy.  &quot;&#039;Crake lives in a higher world, Jimmy,&#039; she said.  &#039;He lives in a world of ideas.  He is doing important things.  He has no time to play.  Anyway, Crake is my boss.  You are for fun&quot; (313).  While Oryx means everything to Jimmy/Snowman, he is little more than a means of entertainment.  While Crake is busy, she passes the time with Jimmy.  I could be completely off with this reading, but I do believe that Jimmy&#039;s obsession with Oryx allows Snowman to remember their past through a filter.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Time Trauma Fiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/345</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There was much talk--and there might easily have been more--about Pattern Recognition&#039;s being legible as a 9/11 novel. The event is manifestly significant for the novel plot-wise, but also to the extent that it informs the book&#039;s disrupted sense of history. It&#039;s interesting, then, that Oryx and Crake was conceived under similar circumstances--might it then be possible to read this book as a response to 9/11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in our first class on Pattern Recognition, the composition of Gibson&#039;s book was interrupted by the attacks on the World Trade Center towers. In &quot;My Life in Science Fiction,&quot; Atwood gives a similar account. What&#039;s of note, then, is how differently the writers respond, how differently they adapt their respective works in progress to reflect what feels to them a different world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think I need to say much about how significant Gibson&#039;s work clearly thinks 9/11 is. Although it&#039;s only, like, a thirtieth of the book, it pervades the rest in really palpable ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Atwood responds by taking a culturally inward turn. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, the closest we get to the quasi-apocalyptic act that catalyzed the sociopolitical lockdown that&#039;s the novel&#039;s main interest is a vague reference to Islamic terrorists. As Atwood notes in her essay, though, &quot;It&#039;s deeply unsettling when you&#039;re writing about a fictional catastrophe and a real one happens.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, this novel works pretty similarly to the earlier one. We&#039;re immediately plunged into a nightmare scenario. There&#039;s cognitive estrangement to the extent that the reader is madly palpating the conventions and limits both official and personal in this new and utterly bizarre world. As in THT, we&#039;ve the general sense that something really, truly awful happened that precipitated the mess we&#039;re witnessing; as in THT, we&#039;re given no clues as to what that might be. At least to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this formal structure, one would assume that the nature of the event itself--whatever it was that gave rise to the new order as it exists in the novel--would be rather more malleable. In which case--and given Atwoods concerns as voiced in her earlier novel--isn&#039;t it all the stranger that Atwoods imaginary apocalypse in Oryx and Crake comes from within, rather than from without?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the result is much the same. For Gibson, 9/11 causes a rupture in history. When he represents the event in his novel, he switches tenses. London functions as a displaced metropolis--the novel is really about New York. The book does everything it can to disconnect us from time and space, as mimetic of mass trauma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake does basically the same things. On the first page, time is the primary question. A question of basic orientation, of order--&quot;Out of habit he looks at his watch&quot;; &quot;It causes a jolt of terror to run through him, this absence of official time&quot;; &quot;Nobody nowhere knows what time it is.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether she chooses to represent the events themselves or no, I&#039;d suggest that Atwood observes a mass dislocation of space and time as a consequence of 9/11 as Gibson does.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Math vs Language</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/344</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key theme in Margaret Atwood&#039;s Oryx and Crake  is the conflict between that which is empirically provable, and that which is a construct of the human mind.  This manifests in  a variety of ways: numbers vs. words, emotion vs. survival, art vs. science.  The protagonist, Jimmy/Snowman, is wrapped up in this conflict, because he is an advocate of the side which believes in the intangibles of human nature, but he feels like his side is losing, or has lost, depending on whether we address him before or after the catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;
	The conflict first emerges early in Jimmy&#039;s life in the guise of an innocent qualification.  He notices at a young age that Ramona talks as if she isn&#039;t very intelligent, but Jimmy&#039;s dad explains it away by saying that, &quot;she didn&#039;t want to put her neuron power into long sentences.&quot; (25)  Apparently, most people working at OrganInc behaved similarly, and it was because &quot;they were numbers people, not word people, [but] Jimmy already knew that he himself was not a numbers person.&quot; (25)  This statement seems innocuous at first: just a child realizing his strengths in language and weaknesses in mathematics.  Yet, as the story progresses, the emphasis on mathematical and logical competence in the compound increases.  As mentioned before, most of the employees of the compounds were oriented towards mathematical rather than verbal prowess, and as such, their children end up with the same orientation.  It&#039;s frequently mentioned that the schools he attends are saturated with genetic science or math geniuses.  The atmosphere is one where Jimmy&#039;s talents aren&#039;t valued, and he knows it.  He knows that his father, mother, and peers accept him as merely sub-standard.  This situation, combined with his desire to justify his own interests and be appreciated for them, is the main root for his perception that the practices of rational thought and artistic thought are at odds.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, once Crake enters Jimmy&#039;s life, the perceived dichotomy deepens to include more than just the two sides of academia.  Crake is the epitome of these math geniuses that make Jimmy&#039;s abilities fade into the background. Crake is characterized by his capacity for rational thought.  He is a remarkable student, who takes his capacity for logical reasoning beyond academia.  He applies it to social philosophy and uses it to dissect the meaning of human actions and their fundamental flaws.  Yet, this application of &quot;rational&quot; thought causes Jimmy to see another side of his own skills.  When hypothesizing about the new human race he would create, Crake addresses the issue of reproduction by effectively limiting romance to brief hormonal periods of fertility, claiming that the sexual frustration of humanity has caused more suffering than necessary.  Jimmy immediately picks up on this as an elimination of something very precious and unscientific: art.  Jimmy says &quot;[romantic frustration] has been an inspiration, or that&#039;s what they say.  Think of all the poetry--&quot; in an attempt to express the value of the &quot;free choice&quot; of romance. (166-7)  Yet, Crake, in his rational mindset, is unable to see art the way Jimmy does.  He responds to Jimmy&#039;s protests by saying, &quot;people can amuse themselves any way they like.  If they want to play with themselves in public, whack off over doodling, scribbling, and fiddling, it&#039;s fine with me.  Anyway it serves a biological purpose.&quot; (167)  He clearly cannot view art in terms of anything but scientifically verifiable value, and for that reason is very dismissive of art.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a trend throughout the entire story.  Jimmy&#039;s value are repeatedly marginalized.  Yet, the outcome cannot be ignored.  The outcome of supposedly perfectly rational thought is apparently apocalypse, and the replacement of humans with some hormonally driven human imitation.  Yet, in this new world, Jimmy is the only suvivor, and he does so through his connection to his extinct culture.  He repeats obscure words as mantras.  But more importantly, the result to Crake&#039;s scientific endeavor is a wholly unscientific people, who despite their programming, are developing mysticism around the legend of Crake and Oryx.  There seems to be a flaw in Crakes rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Oryx and Crake: Once again, Science is Evil</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/343</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a common trope for fiction writers to hate science and technology. The idea that knowledge is a recipe for destruction is deeply rooted in the past, dating back to at least Prometheus&#039; punishment for stealing fire from Mount Olympus. But the more blunt examples are those in the mad scientist category; the Frankensteins, the Jekkyl and Hydes, the Dr. Moreaus, the Lex Luthors, etc. By taking their pursuits of science to unethical extremes, these characters not only wreak havoc, but shame the entire concept of science. Never mind that technology is what has allowed human beings to survive this long, can dramatically improve the length and quality of life, and ( for the &quot; first world &quot;, at least ) has done so repeatedly; all it takes is one guy inventing one monster, and the whole fictional world slides into a Luddite bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake is no different, with its dystopian setting founded on consumer technology run amok. Biotechnology has led to monstrous creations that probably would have led to antibiotic-impervious diseases, information technology and new media have resulted in instant and accepted access to the barbaric, and the resources of the world are dwindling rapidly. There is no suggestion that humanity is trying to improve itself, but merely sleepwalking towards oblivion. Meanwhile, the amoral genius Crake determines that the only way to save society is to replace it with a group of docile, intelligently designed primates with no concept of art or progress. Everyone else is apparently a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we don&#039;t get the Star Trek type view of technology as a faultless elixir for all of humanity&#039;s ills, it would be nice to see a more balanced viewpoint. Atwood is incredibly effective at pointing out the ways technology can be used for destructive purposes, but not so much at showing constructive uses for science. There is no entertainment of the idea that Crake&#039;s science could have saved humanity, merely that the damage that his predecessors did to themselves was irreparable. Apocalypse is a forgone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downfall of society in Oryx and Crake is ultimately not the fault of the technologies, but the people and cultures that abused them-- people like Crake, who hides his sociopathy behind his claims of empirical evidence. When a religion is criticized for the acts of a few fundamentalists, others are quick to point out that the majority of believers are decent, law-abiding citizens. Perhaps a large section of fiction writers need to apply the same logic to science and scientists?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Last Man Standing</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/342</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What I found most captivating about Oryx and Crake was the total sense of isolation that saturates the book.  The narrative helps in creating this sensation of loneliness because the reader is kept ignorant of the most recent events of Snowman&#039;s past up until the very last pages of the book.  As we go along, we have the two separate periods of narration â€“ Jimmy&#039;s childhood and family issues, leading to meeting Crake and school, etc. and then Snowman&#039;s present.  As we get glimpses of Snowman post-apocalypse, we also relive with him his nostalgia and visit to the events of the past with each memory in chronological order.  Until finally, Jimmy becomes Snowman and the two narratives find one another in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire book is narrated by Snowman, and aside from superficial insights into the characters of Oryx and Crake (and perhaps even the parental figures of Jimmy and Crake), his is the only point of view we experience throughout the book.  When we see him react to creations like the ChickieNobs, we understand how to react.  And in his adolescent period when he is playing games with Crake and watching bizarre porn and executions on the internet, the reader sees that there are distinct differences between our reality and his.  While Snowman is not the most agreeable or inspirational character, the reader identifies with him, partly because we adore flawed heroes, but also because, honestly, he&#039;s our only choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Atwood depicts this type of post-apocalyptic devastation creates a truly haunting vision of the future, that is a little too easy to picture.  The sensations of being abandoned by one&#039;s entire species can really be felt by the reader because the only characters we ever meet are in Jimmy&#039;s head and they are repeatedly made surreal and mirage-like.  The Crakers only help in the most primitive way, appealing to Snowman&#039;s need to be with others, feel human touch, and to speak, to remember the words he used to worship (even though the Crakers have no understanding or context for most of them).  Atwood beautifully conveys the emptiness that Snowman feels, realistically simulating the waves of semi-contentment and total despair at the reality of his situation.  It seems to be a common trope of science fiction, but also the genre of zombie movies, to create a fiction in which the hero is alone, isolated, and facing the extinction of all human beings should he/she fail.  In the film Resident Evil: Extinction, there is a similar landscape, dry and exceedingly hot, with supplies, food, and weapons rapidly diminishing while the enemy grows.  Snowman&#039;s only enemies were hunger, madness, and the wildlife (including the marauding bands of pigs with people parts).  Obviously, within the context of action films the main character, Alice, has superhuman characteristics and the audience knows from the start that she will triumph over her obstacles.  Part of the appeal of Snowman is that he is Everyman, John Smith, a neurotypical, with absolutely no exceptional skills, no super-attuned senses of physical abilities and there is no certain prediction for his future within this miserable shell of the former world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems particularly upsetting that there is no Hollywood resolution to this book, although it would be difficult to imagine how such a fictional space could have a happy ending.  Even though the book ends incredibly abruptly, with many possibilities and questions for the immediate future, the resolution of the two stories into one at least provides a narrative closure and a degree of satisfaction with how the story concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m going to use my last &quot;freebie&quot; blog post and cop out on this one, because I have two term papers due this week as well as a video production project, and all of my ideas about this novel were pretty thoroughly dissected in class. I will be making several comments on others&#039; posts to contribute, though. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Crake vs. the Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/340</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we very briefly touched on this in class today, but I was interested in the parallels between Oryx and Crake and Xenogenesis.  Clearly, the biggest parallel was that the human race ends up wiped out and reformatted against its will, for its own good (or so someone claims).  The narration of both novels takes place at least mostly in the immediate aftermath.  The initial struggle for survival removes the capacity to act in the ways that initially caused the downfall of the human race, but in both novels, there&#039;s the suggestion that this fix is temporary, and the situation will degenerate in to what it was before.  This shows up through the reappearance of guns in Xenogenesis, as well as the overall degeneration of the resister colonies into violence.  In Oryx and Crake it manifests in the effigy the Crakers build of Snowman.  Crake &quot;programmed&quot; them through genetic engineering not to have the capacity to create abstract art, because he thought it was tied in to a tendency to invent religion, and then to wage war. Even if he&#039;s wrong in making that connection, the fact that they do have the capacity create these abstract figures suggests that he may not have successfully removed more explicitly harmful human characteristics.  &quot;Next they&#039;d be inventing idols, and funerals, and grave goods, and the afterlife, and sin, and Linear B, and kings, and then slavery and war&quot; (361).  Then the mass slaughter of humanity would have occurred for absolutely no reason at all.  Both books present the &quot;better&quot; reconstructed human race as transient, suggesting that the efforts to fix us are futile.&lt;br /&gt;
I think the most important difference between the two novels is what happened before the restructuring of humanity occurred.  Both the Oankali and Crake saw the destruction of the human race as inevitable, before it happened.  Crake make a preemptive strike and he wiped the human slate clean before it imploded so he could impose his own perception of what humanity should be.  The Oankali recognized the fatal flaw of the humans before the nuclear holocaust happened, but did not step in to prevent the damage.  They waited out the inevitable death and destruction, and then swooped down on the planet and performed their human reformatting, and which point they could present themselves as the saviors of the human race, as they performed their biological imperative.  They seem more like the vultures that plague Snowman as he walks across the newly formed wasteland than saviors.&lt;br /&gt;
So which is worse, the actions of Crake, or the inaction of the Oankali?  Both are delusional in that they believe they are acting in the best interest of humanity.  But Crake at least realizes to a certain extent that he may have gone a little too far.  He can&#039;t let himself see his own creation.  He put in an official standing order for Jimmy to take over if &quot;anything happens&quot; to him and mentions that at that point Oryx wouldn&#039;t be around either, suggesting that he planned his suicide long before the actual event (320).  Some form of guilt or uneasiness had to have overcome his megalomaniacal tendencies not to get the satisfaction of watching his children flourish.  The Oankali experience no such pangs of guilt, they are happy not to even leave any human akjai before Akin fights for that right.  And though they did not orchestrate the mass murder of millions of humans in the same direct manner that Crake did, they certainly did nothing to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;
So I&#039;m curious, who do you guys think is more nefarious?  Crake or the Oankali?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gender Inequality in Oryx and Crake.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/339</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our brief discussion of how Snowman is a corrupting influence on the Crakers started me thinking about how Snowman teaches human principles of ranking. He introduces the concept that men and women should behave differently, picking the men to lead the trek and surround and protect the women and children. Biological sex differences may lead to men and women taking different roles, but Snowman assigns these roles of different value without explaining why, simply citing it as &quot;the proper way&quot; (350). The &quot;women and children&quot; are grouped together without question, and the narration implies that they *clearly* need protection, which is only available from the men. I don&#039;t know how a non-monogamous society would raise its young (I wonder if there are any non-extinct animals that work like that?), but it seems like it might break down existing gender roles, not re-enforce them more strictly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of comparison, consider the treatment of race. &quot;[R]acism â€“ or, as they referred to it in Paradice, pseudospeciation â€“ had been eliminated in the model group, merely by switching the bonding mechanism: the Paradice people simply did not register skin colour. Hierarchy could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes that would have created it&quot; (305). The Crakers are, in fact, color-blind when it comes to race. Unless the scientists were to completely make-over the reproductive process (a lÃ¡ Butler), gender differences will remain. So, can you have differences without an attached system of ranking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the words of sociologist Robert W. Fuller in his novel on &quot;rankism,&quot; a blanket term for all cases of abuse within a system of power differences (e.g. racism, sexism, classism, etc.): &quot;It is crucial to get one thing straight from the start: power differences, in themselves, are not the culprit. To bemoan power differences is like bemoaning the fact that the sun is brighter than the moon. And rank differences merely reflect power differences, so rank differences are not the problem either, any more than color or gender differences are used as an excuse to abuse, humiliate, exploit, and subjugate. So it is with power and rank&quot; (&quot;Somebodies and Nobodies&quot;, 4). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the conceptual idea for the Crakers is similar. The idea was that they would be so perfectly engineered that &quot;hierarchy could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes that would have created it&quot; (305). I just don&#039;t quite understand how this could be possible. They were supposedly so perfectly engineered for their environment that they wouldn&#039;t need to make weapons, but they seemed pretty helpless without Snowman&#039;s gun. I think the context of real life outside of a predator-less biodome really calls these engineered assumptions into question, and that includes the existence of gender roles and sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ahahaahaa last minute</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/338</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading, I noticed several self-referential comments woven into the narrative, remarks that seemed to comment back on Neuromancer and the academic work surrounding it.  Though apparently Gibson is less aware than I thought him to be â€“ how did he not notice that he had created another character with the name Case? â€“ my personal opinion is that reader interpretation is as important, if not more important, than authorial intent.  I think that what I found was interesting, even if it was not planted there by Gibson to be found.  Or, perhaps, I am just recognizing false patterns, in which case this becomes interesting on an entirely different level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the academic work that has been done on Neuromancer discusses the mind-body divide, and how it plays out in cyberpunk in general and Neuromancer in particular.  The concept that we have both a body and a consciousness separate from it â€“ the mind or the soul â€“ is a philosophical construction dating to ancient Greek.  In Western culture, particularly, the mind became more and more privileged over the body, culminating in Neuromancer&#039;s fantasy of total escape from the body and into cyberspace.  The body becomes &quot;the meat thing,&quot; something to be disdained entirely (Neuromancer 55).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pattern Recognition, Gibson begins with his own assessment of Neuromancer&#039;s style of science fiction: &quot;We have no idea, now, of who or what the inhabitants of our future might be.  In that sense, we have no future.  Not in the sense that our grandparents had a future, or  thought they did.  Fully imagined cultural futures were the luxury of another day, one in which the &#039;now&#039; was of some greater duration&quot; (Pattern 58-59).  Rather than fantasize about an alternate dimension of disembodied minds that may never be, Pattern Recognition demonstrates how that feeling of escape from the body can be enacted with the technology we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he clarifies that an actual escape of the mind from the body is neither possible nor desirable â€“ he grounds consciousness more securely in the organs of the body.  Again speaking through Bigend, Gibson writes, &quot;what we think of as &#039;mind&#039; is only a sort of jumped-up gland, piggybacking on our reptilian brainstem and the older, mammalian mind, but our culture tricks us into recognizing it as all of consciousness&quot; (Pattern 71).  After reading article after article about the mind-body gap in Neuromancer, this appeared to me to be a direct reply from Gibson to all the academics who had been discussing his book amongst themselves for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he includes a mention of Parkaboy &quot;railing on about Mama Anarchia&#039;s tendency to quote Baudrillard and other Frenchmen who annoy him so deeply&quot; (Pattern 50).  Baudrillard&#039;s work on &quot;hyperreality&quot; was mentioned often in the articles I read about the disembodied mind, and though I obviously cannot be sure who the other Frenchmen are, the &quot;father of modern philosophy,&quot; Rene Descartes, the man responsible for the modern formulation of the divide between mind and body, was French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many of the mentions Gibson makes in the beginning of the book seem critical of the concept of cyberspace, Cayce experiences the internet very much like Case experience the matrix.  Sure, she does not attach any electrodes to her head and go rushing around in receding city lights, but the internet provides her life with more meaning than the real world ever does.  The internet gives her the footage to obsess over, the catalyst for the sort of quest for truth that she embarks on, and Parkaboy, a better and truer match for her than anyone she could find in the real world by herself, as Boone Chu attests.  Though embodiment is not criticized in Pattern Recognition, as it is in Neuromancer, the mind is still the important bit of that partnership, capable of finding meaning in life much more profound on its own than fettered by the body.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m taking my second pass on Gibson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, how awesome is watching Battlestar Galactica for class? I&#039;m definitely not going to make it through four seasons, but I&#039;m pretty hooked...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The End of the Past and Seeing Beyond</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/336</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I was a bit confused about why The Matrix was our movie to watch with Pattern Recognition, but having thought about it I think there are two major themes that run through both works, though Pattern Recognition clearly tries to stay grounded roughly in the present, while The Matrix extrapolates them to  far more extreme situations. Both works, though, demonstrate the key challenges of defining history, through a character&#039;s ability to &quot;see beyond&quot; reality to some hidden truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that Pattern Recognition is in large part a response to 9/11, and Gibson clearly considers that event a major demarcation of history into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;. To this end, the many cultural references Gibson makes to technology and fashion serve to ground the world&#039;s chronology in a very exact and careful way; while some critics claimed that Gibson&#039;s style in this book would &quot;date&quot; it, this is in fact exactly what he must do to make his point. He is emphasizing that as of now, we cannot tie our culture back to the one of a few years prior, and thus our only way of defining the world is to use whatever cultural markers we have today. The rupture in cultural development has set us adrift, and we have only the most trivial methods of defining ourselves. This &quot;rupture&quot; is immediately obvious in the Matrix as well, where all of human experience hit an abrupt &quot;reset&quot; button, when the world simply became an endless computer simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response to this rupture and lack of total comprehension is a character who understands reality, albeit intuitively rather than consciously, on a deeper level, to see the hidden machinery that most people accept blindly. Cayse and Neo are both heroes in these worlds because they can somehow tap into the forces of the world that would otherwise hinder them: Cayse the cultural flow of trends and fashions, Neo the computer code of the Matrix. While they cannot return to the pre-rupture world, they are nonetheless able to ground themselves in some deeper reality while most people are simply floating through a world newly separated from its own history.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/335</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Pattern Recognition Science Fiction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think so.  Of course Science Fiction is already a fairly ill defined genre.  However, I would define Science fiction as having a What if? Statement that is explored in the novel.  For example, The Left Hand of Darkness asked what if there was a planet of androgynies.  Neuromancer asked what if there were a world wide information network and AIs in habiting it.  Pattern Recognition doesn&#039;t make any such supposition to me.  It seems like a perfectly acceptable story that could really happen in real life, and for me that means that it is just fiction.  Everything in Pattern Recognition was based in reality in a way that Science Fiction doesn&#039;t seem to be.  The most far fetched thing was Cayce&#039;s allergy to trademarks and brands, but as a psychosomatic disorder,  it seems like it could happen.  The rampant use of email can be used as an example of science in the fiction, but it appears just like normal life.  Had this book been set 10-15 years ago, I could see email being as ubiquitous as it is in the novel as a argument for science fiction, but because people actually use email as often as it is used in the book it no longer seems out of the ordinary.  Meeting people from forums is also old hat.  The story of people meeting online, dating, and then falling in love and marrying is now a common place story.  Pattern Recognition is a good book, but I can&#039;t consider it science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Identity and Relationships in Pattern Recognition&#039;s Online Space</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/334</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought one of the most interesting bits of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; was the way people&#039;s online friendships worked out - what with Parkaboy/Cayce and Judy/Taki eventually hooking up in the real world based on affections that were developed almost exclusively through online chatting. Obviously, this stuff says a lot about how Gibson sees the world of 2002 and the relation of technology in it to human interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cayce&#039;s dealings in cyberspace mostly take the form of posts on a publicly-available bulletin board, though she also engages in email. But the way Cayce uses that bulletin board is fundamentally different from the way Case interacts with others online in Neuromancer. That&#039;s because of the nature of the medium. Cayce, like most denizens of the modern web, can&#039;t converse face-to-face with her bulletin-board friends: she doesn&#039;t video-chat, so she can&#039;t sense people&#039;s body language, and she doesn&#039;t even have much idea who most of the people are outside of their commentary on the footage. Even though people have begun to develop communities and human relationships in cyberspace, these relationships and communities consist mostly of exchanges of text. People&#039;s identities are easily obscured, but - in &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; â€“ the relationships they form are nonetheless legitimate and meaningful, often more powerful than predominantly in-person relationships. The deep friendship between Cayce and Parkaboy is the most prevalent example, but perhaps the most intriguing such relationship is between Judy and Taki. Originally, Musashi (Darryl) and Parkaboy are just using Judy as an image to weasel information out of Taki, but when she and Taki start actually talking with each other, &quot;She&#039;s mesmerized by the extent (she says the heartbreaking purity) of Taki&#039;s passion for her&quot; and begins to think &quot;that the love Taki has to offer her is the love she&#039;s waited for all her life&quot; despite &quot;the fact that she knews Taki things she&#039;s a petite Japanese college girl, and that Darryl is translating for her both ways&quot; (232). Gibson uses the book to comment that people are increasingly text-oriented, and the inability to prejudge people in the textual realm based on their race or appearance allows new kinds of relationships to exist, such as the love between Taki and Judy that subsists â€“ at least, initially â€“ on the basis of emotion and writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, that relationship seems to ultimately work out despite the problems it faces initially, as one of the final emails applauds &quot;her enthusiasm for the city (and her boyfriend!)&quot; in Tokyo (364-365). In the world of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt;, not only is it possible to fall in love with someone just by exchanging emails, and ultimately to meet the person in real life â€“ but those relationships seem better than the relationships characters otherwise end up in â€“ as evidenced by the way Cayce ends up with Parkaboy instead of Damien, who is still muddled in a difficult relationship with the daughter of the man funding his documentary project. The happy resolutions point towards a general optimism about humans&#039; ability to adapt to such a text-based culture - maybe even a belief that such a world is better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Movies in Pattern Recognition.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/332</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One element of Pattern Recognition that struck me was the use of movie titles or directors in descriptions of both people and places in the novel.  While I did not enjoy the novel much as a whole, I liked how Gibson included these contemporary tidbits of information.  It really helped clear up some of the environments that Cayce was in, and gave the novel a more realistic narrative feel.  I noticed references to The Matrix and to female characters in general in most role-playing games on page 187. And to director Ridley Scott&#039;s sets on page 248.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first, Cayce&#039;s description of Marina, wearing &quot;whatâ€¦is this season&#039;s Prada exclusively, everything black&quot; and looking like she is &quot;Caucasian in some primordial, geological sense&quot; immediately brings black-leathered, pale angular-faced Trinity to mind, even without the direct Matrix reference.  It fits in well with the feelings of &#039;soul-delay&#039; and wide-ranging unreality that Cayce is experiencing here.  Adding to this, Cayce then asserts that, &quot;if her boobs were bigger, she could get work on the covers of role-playing games for adolescent boys of any age whatever.&quot;  I thought this was a hilarious statement, having often shaken my head at the ridiculous proportions and clothes some of the cover woman on those types of games have.  One simple Google search of Everquest, with no mention of cleavage or feminine attributes whatsoever came up with this image including both World of Warcraft and Everquest woman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&quot;&gt;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This brought back memories of our class discussions on the first Street Samurai badass Molly in Neuromancer as well.  It is almost as though Gibson is making a parody of Molly here, with her leather pants and dangerous, attractive body.&lt;br /&gt;
	The last reference to Ridley Scott brings up a wealth of science fiction scenes to mind, not the least of which are Blade Runner and Alien.  The &quot;sunlight, shafting dramatically in through a few small holes {in the ceiling]â€¦giving the space the look of a Ridley Scott set&quot; sets the mood for the odd conversation between Cayce and Baranov very well.  The dark, cigarette smoke-filled is transformed with this element included, conjuring images of spotlights illuminating a dirty, futuristic Los Angeles street, or of patches of light shining through the floor grates and air ducts of the Nostromo.  The mood becomes that much more sinister and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unrepresentable</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/331</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that struck me while reading Pattern Recognition is that it must be impossible to convincingly describe rapturous aesthetic experience. Or to represent an aesthetic work within an aesthetic work. I&#039;m thinking of the &quot;footage&quot; in the novel and how basically unappealing it sounded to me whenever described. Or, rather, it wasn&#039;t so much that I found it unappealing, but that I had serious difficulty imagine anyone having such a strong aesthetic reaction to it as to, you know, devote hours every day to scouring the web for more footage, or obsess endlessly--see &quot;Zaprudered&quot;--over the already discovered chunks. It just didn&#039;t sound that cool to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the first description: &quot;Light and shadow. Lovers&#039; cheekbones in the prelude to embrace.&quot; Gibson often writes fragments like these; usually they&#039;re meant to convey a sense of kinesis--like, if somebody&#039;s running down the street observing things, those things will then get referred to in sentence fragments. Here, I guess the fragments are meant to convey the movement or progress of the film itself. Also: they&#039;re not very pretty sentences. Rather than try to represent the aesthetic quality of the film via any sort of high lyricism, Gibson&#039;s made the more conservative move: just describe what Cayce sees on the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what does she see? Two people hugging against a black background. The description makes it sound as if the film were in black and white, although that&#039;s never explicitly stated--all the &quot;light&quot; v. &quot;dark&quot; stuff sounds like a BW chiaroscuro. Something like German expressionism, I guess; a Murnau film of two people hugging. And then the kiss, and the flash and white-out. And this sends Cayce into rapture? After she&#039;s seen it twice, she&#039;s so exhausted that she has to go to bed--granted, she was tired before watching the film, but then she gets all hopped up on coffee in order to watch it. I just don&#039;t buy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think I&#039;m simply being an uncharitable reader, though. As I said, I think Gibson&#039;s problem is bigger than just his having written some uninspired description. I think something similar happens in David Foster Wallace&#039;s book Infinite Jest, actually. For those of you who haven&#039;t read it, one of the several plots has to do with this mysterious movie made by an artsy filmmaker that&#039;s so unbelievably captivating that anyone who watches it never wants to stop and so essentially goes into a coma--people die in front of their screens because they can&#039;t stop watching the movie. Obviously, it&#039;s a joke--Infinite Jest is part science fiction in that it&#039;s extrapolative; the whole bit with the movie is taking idea of &quot;mindless&quot; entertainment and positing a world in which entertainment really had the ability to make people mindless. So the world of Infinite Jest is actually less governed by the rules of the empirical world than that of Pattern Recognition; it&#039;s easier to believe that Infinite Jest the movie has the kind of power over people that Wallace says it does simply because his world isn&#039;t the same as ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, though, whenever IJ gets around to describing scenes from the movie--which happens, I think, maybe in an endnote somewhere around page six-hundred--it really just doesn&#039;t sound that cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace does the same dancing around the actual description of the film that Gibson does in this book. Before we have any idea what Infinite Jest the film looks like, we know that people become fatally addicted to it; before we have any clue at all as to what the &quot;footage&quot; is of, we know that there&#039;s a significant underground of hardcore devotees. In both cases, then, the expectation of the film&#039;s aesthetic content is pretty astronomically high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in both cases--it seems to me--the representation of a representation is doomed to fail. Plato already knew that, though.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hubertus and Cayce.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/330</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the analysis that I performed on Pattern Recognition in my final essay, I concluded that Cayce was almost asexual in the novel, and that any graphic or direct depictions of sex had an adverse effect on the commitments that Cayce had made or wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over the novel, in revising my paper, I&#039;ve realized that Cayce is far from asexual. In fact, I feel like her sexuality is a really fundamental piece of her personality, but, like everything about her and the novel, it is understated to the point that it is difficult to notice. One of the major interactions that I failed to consider in my first analysis was the interaction between Cayce and Hubertus, when they go out to the bar and Hubertus proposes the Footage project (61-73). Throughout the interaction, Cayce feels Hubertus&#039; presence: his voice is &quot;strangely compelling&quot; (62), he is &quot;undeniably good-looking&quot; (67), she feels herself &quot;held by those eyes, against all conscious will&quot; (64), she even flirts a little bit at the end of the night, showing Hubertus how to put on his cowboy hat properly (73). Cayce is clearly attracted to Hubertus, somehow, but it is a definitely physical attraction. Though it may not be directly sexual, it is definitely not intellectual, and in fact goes counter to Cayce&#039;s natural impulses. Sex is one of the first things on her mind when she interacts with Bigend (she&#039;s suddenly on &quot;full sexual alert&quot; (63)), so she is clearly not asexual. She understands and realizes her own reactions to Bigend, but she keeps them hidden and does not outwardly react to them. But nevertheless, this desire, this outward sexuality is associated with Bigend, who Cayce never completely trusts (also partly because of the sexual betrayal that he has inflicted on her friend from New York). Throughout the novel, it is the handsome men, the ones that she feels some sort of desire for, that Cayce distrusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my reconsideration of the overall tone of the novel, and of Cayce&#039;s attitude towards sex, I still think that the direct appearance of sex is closely associated with the breaking of commitments and a lack of trust. There is one major counter-example to this argument, that was pointed out by both professor Fitzpatrick and my peer reviewer. In my rough draft, I mentioned the example of Donny, who is mentioned at length only twice in the novel, both times regarding sexual experiences that Cayce had with him. I regarded both of these experiences as essentially the same: direct portrayals of sex, and a direct associations between sex and Donny, who Cayce rightly broke up with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reviewers pointed out that the real reason that Cayce broke up with Donny was not because of the overt association between him and sex (Cayce is &quot;more or less happy&quot; lying underneath him, after all), but instead because of the association of Donny with extremely violent behavior (finding the gun taped conveniently behind his headboard) (41). I agree with this argument, to some extent. However, I think that the association between this breakup and sex is inescapable. It could have been any other time that Cayce could have realized that Donny was a violent person. He could have hit her, he could have gotten unreasonably angry, she could even have found the gun while she was stretching to wake up in the morning next to him. But she found it during sex. Her breakup with this person, no matter the actual reason, occurred during the one and only semi-graphic portrayal of sex in the entire novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m sure that there were good moments with Donny, just as there are redeeming factors to Boone Chu and Hubertus, but in the way that Cayce&#039;s attraction to all these men is associated with lack of trust and the breaking of commitments, the novel discounts these good qualities and returns to my main point: sex must be secondary in Cayce&#039;s interactions with others, or there can be no trust between them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narration in Oryx and Crake</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/329</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Going along (sort of) with my response, I wanted to add in the idea of the narrative voice in Oryx and Crake.  Obviously, it varies from Jimmy to Snowman, but there are also moments in which another narrator supercedes both of the protagonist&#039;s voices.  Examples: &quot;So who is he to blame them? (He blames them)&quot; (page 67); &quot;Jimmy didn&#039;t envy him. (He envied him.)&quot; (page 250).  At other times, this new narrator knows things that neither Jimmy nor Snowman could: &quot;(Jimmy&#039;s dad refused to pay...he and the dentist had a shouting match later, over the phone.) (page 62).  At first, I thought that these parenthetical statements were simply Snowman inserting comments over Jimmy&#039;s storytelling, but sometimes they&#039;re things that Snowman really couldn&#039;t have known.  Is this just a goof on the part of Atwood? Or is there another narrative voice that only pops up at certain times?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 10. Or maybe 9. Pattern Recognition.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/328</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A Few Thoughts on Pattern Recognition (potentially scattered, I apologize.)&lt;br /&gt;
One of the things that interested me most in Pattern Recognition was Gibson&#039;s recycling of his protagonist&#039;s name.  I know that we talked about this a little bit in class, but it was definitely one of the things that stuck out to me most about the novel (shoot me, I&#039;m not a Gibson fan!).  Also, I know that Gibson claims that he didn&#039;t do it on purpose.  But, I mean, come on! There are millions of names in the world and he has enough imagination to come up with whole new science-fiction realms.  I would think that he could at least think of a new name.&lt;br /&gt;
	So I decided to look up who exactly the Cayce who the Cayce of Pattern Recognition was named for.  Apparently, Edgar Cayce was a psychic from the early 20th century.  In that way, Cayce seems like a perfectly appropriate name for the protagonist of Pattern Recognition.  Obviously, her abilities are paranormal, although apparently coolhunter is not an expression invented by Gibson, but is actually a fairly common term for someone who is hired to predict trends (who knew?).&lt;br /&gt;
	I find myself wondering whether or not the use of the name Cayce was actually a pattern intended by Gibson.  Or is it simply a flash of apophenia?  By using the name again, Gibson seems to be inviting his readers to draw a connection between the two protagonists.  And their lives are, at times, disturbingly similar: two seemingly free-spirited professionals (one hacker, one coolhunter) are offered contracts. Action ensues.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, the novels&#039; endings are different enough that I didn&#039;t find myself immediately wanting to write Cayce&#039;s story off as the feminine version of Neuromancer.  (Obviously, there are tons of other differences--over-simplification for the point of a reading response.)  The end of Neuromancer intentionally veers away from a fairy-tale ending: Molly leaves Case, eliminating any possibility of a future between the two of them.  In contrast, the ending of Pattern Recognition seems to veer in the opposite direction: everything is worked out rather neatly, and Cayce finds romantic happiness and comes to terms with the disappearance of her father.  The ending might be why I found myself not liking Pattern Recognition as much as Neuromancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 9</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/327</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading Oryx and Crake, I was fascinated by the narrative structure that Atwood uses to tell her characters&#039; story.  At first, it was extremely confusing: it was difficult to tell the point at which Jimmy stopped and Snowman began.  However, once I acclimated to this technique, I found it really interesting.  After recognizing the differences between Jimmy and Snowman, I realized that pretty much every character has at least two identities, although they are not necessarily as clear-cut as those of the narrator.  Crake is another such character, although his latter identity essentially overtakes the former: &quot;Snowman has trouble thinking of Crake as Glenn, so thoroughly has Crake&#039;s later persona blotted out his earlier one&quot; (Atwood 71).  Oryx is just as fragmented as Snowman and Crake, in many ways: &quot;How long had it taken him to piece her together from the slivers of her he&#039;d gathered and hoarded so carefully? There was Crake&#039;s story about her, and Jimmy&#039;s story about her as wellâ€¦and then there was her own story about herselfâ€¦There must once have been other versions of herâ€¦&quot; (Atwood 114).  Snowman himself seems attached to this idea that humans have dual identities.  When presented with the character of Jack, the pornographer from Oryx&#039;s childhood, he demands to know not just the name by which Oryx knows him, but &quot;his other name&quot; (Atwood 143).  Atwood links the concept of identity with name, suggesting that a name has an underlying power to create one&#039;s identity.  She also interconnects the concept of self-identity with that of identity presented by others, implying that multiple stories co-exist within one person.  However, it seems unclear whether or not these identities can actually co-exist.  Are they, instead, exclusive?&lt;br /&gt;
	Snowman and Jimmy seem to be one example in which two separate identities cannot co-exist.  Instead, at the moment when he meets the Crakers, he decides that &quot;he no longer wanted to be Jimmy, or even Jim, and especially not Thickneyâ€¦He needed to forget the past--the distant past, the immediate past, the past in any form&quot; (Atwood 348).  However, Snowman is unable to fully escape his past, even at the very end of the novel.  The last page illustrates this as Snowman hears echoes from his past: &quot;Oh Jimmy, you were so funny&quot; (Atwood 374).  Even at the very end of the novel, Snowman is unable to let go of his identity as Jimmy.&lt;br /&gt;
	In contrast to Snowman, whose present identity seems consumed by that of his past, Crake&#039;s past seems completely overwhelmed by his future.  To Snowman, Crake&#039;s past identity as Glenn is nothing more than &quot;a disguise.&quot;  Unable to reconcile the persona of Glenn with that of Crake, Snowman claims, &quot;The Crake side of him must have been there from the beginning&quot; (Atwood 71).  However, this idea of Crake&#039;s latter identity as omnipresent clashes with Snowman&#039;s own desire to reject and forget his past.  Atwood seems to imply, through Crake&#039;s persistent identity and Snowman&#039;s own inability to actually forget his past, that identity is an underlying facet to one&#039;s personality, something that cannot actually be changed.&lt;br /&gt;
	The character of Oryx is an interesting mesh of identities, since her actual character seems rather vague throughout the entire novel. I found her identity especially interesting because she means so many different things to so many different characters. Snowman himself has an entire persona built up around the picture of her that he printed off from a porno site when he was fourteen, but Oryx seems unsure of whether or not it is actually her.  At times, Oryx seems like nothing more than a construct, some sort of idealistic girl dreamt up by Crake and Jimmy when they were fourteen.  The Crakers&#039; association with her does little to dissuade this image, since she becomes a sort of goddess in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>recognizing names</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/326</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I found interesting about Pattern Recognition--especially as it includes a world of screen names--is the use of names. Obviously we touched on Cayce in class, but only briefly. What struck me most about Cayce was that, just before she explains the pronunciation of her name, she actually tells Voytek, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; (Gibson 32). Never having actually read Moby Dick (my high school was rather terrible), I would have just been confused by this statement except that in another of my classes, we just recently read a different novel with a very similar reference. For those of you in the dark, like I was, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; is the first line in Moby Dick. What we immediately know about Ishmael--and Cayce?--is that he is a survivor of the story he is about to recount. I suppose this is encouraging as far as Cayce is concerned because her story is told in present tense, as if it is all happening *right now*. The idea that she will survive the events of the novel, whatever they may become, is nice to note. The other interesting thing about this line is that, from the way it is phrased, the reader can never know whether or not Ishmael is the narrator&#039;s real name. This certainly ties into the idea that &quot;Cayce,&quot; according to her, should actually be pronounced &quot;Casey,&quot; but she says it as &quot;Case.&quot; This, coupled with the fact that the only other Gibson I&#039;ve read featured another Case as narrator (interesting pun), adds to the ambiguity of her actual name. To go even further, it can be said that no one has any one true name, as the nature of names is that they are ambiguous: is our narrator Cayce, Cayce Pollard, or CayceP? And those are only the names we are given in the novel--we aren&#039;t told her middle name (unless I missed that somewhere), and she might have other nicknames as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Cayce is not the only name of interest in Pattern Recognition; certainly the title suggests the reader will be looking for connections and importance in all names (as well as other things). We are very briefly introduced to Parkaboy on page four, the name not really fitting with his description later on as &quot;a man with reddish, receding hair, combed straight back,&quot; who purposefully describes himself as a &quot;middle-aged white guy&quot; (337). His &quot;real&quot; name is Peter Gilbert, which does seem to fit this description better. Interestingly, however, &quot;Parkaboy&quot; appears very fitting to his online personality, the way he writes in emails and forums--kind of silly but with a solid intelligence behind it. It makes me want to think of the physical person as Peter Gilbert and of the personality as Parkaboy; yet of course, they are one and the same. It does show, however, that if we were left to pick our own names, we might pick names that more accurately fit who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is Hubertus Bigend, who seems to fit his name in some perfect way: &quot;a nominal Belgian who looks like Tom Cruise on a diet of virgins&#039; blood and truffled chocolates&quot; (7). His girth apparently fits his name, though he either does not see the humorous connection or (more likely, given pattern recognition) he refuses to acknowledge it. Cayce also knows Bigend as a &quot;Lombard,&quot; &quot;which Cayce had at first thought might be a reference somehow to his Belgian-ness, until learning, upon finally asking, that it was Margot&#039;s acronym for &#039;Loads of money but a real dickhead&#039; &quot; (57). In this case, of course, the name is quite applicable, and once again goes to show that names made up later in life better portray the person than names given at birth (though Bigend&#039;s name comes close to this). This does point out the problem with trying to give associations to people&#039;s names in novels--for a character&#039;s name to mean something about him or her, it actually must be a name that would not be theirs in reality. What I mean is, in the real world, names don&#039;t usually say something about a person&#039;s character, the way they often do in a novel. Thus, the more &quot;realistic&quot; a novel is, the less the names will mean. How disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>pattern recognition response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/325</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it&#039;s been a while since I last posted a response, so here are some thoughts about Pattern Recognition. Two aspects of this which I thought were quite interesting were the ideas of mirror worlds and soul-delay.  What struck me as particularly interesting about mirror worlds was that, in a way, I read the book as thought it was set in a mirror world to our own.  It is a world we more or less know, but the manner in which Gibson presents it is quite foreign. There are Starbucks on street corners, familiar cities and recognizable brand names are everywhere. It&#039;s a version of our world, only tweaked slightly. There are other corporations as well and the use of technology, while it seems quite commonplace in 2008, was something not unheard of, but pretty new back in 2002. I found that the notion of &quot;cognitive estrangement&quot; worked well in this regard since its just similar enough to home that the differences can be off-putting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of soul delay I also thought was intriguing. Cayce explains that &quot;Damien&#039;s theory of jet lag is correct: that her mortal soul is leagues behind her, being reeled in on some ghostly umbilical down the vanished wake of the plane that brought her here, hundreds of thousands of feet above the Atlantic. Souls can&#039;t move that quickly, and are left behind, and must be awaited, upon arrival, like lost luggage&quot; (1-2).  She seems to be very concerned with soul-delay. I thought it was interesting so I made little ticks when it was mentioned and ended up making about two dozen ticks. In fact, she seems to be concerned with souls in general. When discussing how people of the future will look on people of her time she says that they won&#039;t think about  &quot;ordinary actual living souls&quot; (58) And that her father&#039;s colleagues were not &quot;felled by anything more sinister than stress and overwork, and perhaps by a species of depression engendered by too long and too closely observing the human soul&quot; (227) Interestingly, despite constantly discussing souls and soul-delay she claims that she doesn&#039;t know if she really believes in human souls. Perhaps it&#039;s the same way she doesn&#039;t actually believe in the EVP messages her mother is constantly sending her but which do &quot;creep (her) out&quot; (275) There seems to be a definitiveness about death, especially of the death of her father, which she doesn&#039;t want to accept and souls (and EVP) are a way to extend the life of someone, so to speak, although they aren&#039;t always believed to actually exist in a technologically and scientifically based world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unfortunately uninspired</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/324</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So as much as I enjoyed the book I can&#039;t think of anything to add to what I said about it last Monday in class.  As much as I would love to scrutinize the mantra &quot;He took a duck in the face at two hundred and fifty knots&quot; I&#039;m finding myself particularly dry on creativity (101).  I think it&#039;s all been poured into my thesis.  I promise I&#039;ll have something fascinating to say about Oryx and Crake :-D&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition: brands</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/323</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a lot of different ways, Pattern Recognition reminds me of some postmodern books I&#039;ve read, especially Infinite Jest.  IJ also exhibits signs of our society&#039;s preoccupation with brands (Large corporations advertise by sponsoring/subsidizing a year.  For example, &quot;Year of Dairy Products from the American Heartland.&quot;)  Also, during the discussion of Slow River, conspicuous consumption.  These are themes that also pop up in PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is set in the futuristic present, which is definitely preoccupied with labels, brands, and name-dropping.  Gibson casually references DKNY, Michelin, Louis Vuitton, and others.  The brands he mentions are brands from all over the world, and this emphasizes the ongoing globalization of a mass market.  The signs of this are everywhere.  Damien&#039;s flat has German and Italian appliances; Cayce has German locks installed; the coffee is from Colombia.  This is different from the concept of England as a &quot;mirror-world.&#039;&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;mirror-world,&quot; everything is slightly familiar and recognizable, yet different.  It is a foreign atmosphere with new species of brands to be wary of.  (Additionally, Cayce is thrown out of her element because she is unaccustomed to the British lifestyle: people drive on the opposite side of the road, the food looks and tastes different, etc.)  England&#039;s difference is attributed to the fact that its products are made and assembled within its borders.  &quot;They invented that here, probably, and made it here.  This was an industrial nation.  Buy a pair of scissors, you got British scissors.  They made all their own stuff.  Kept imports expensive...All their bits and pieces were different, from the ground up&quot; (108).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With outsourcing and such, products that are recognizably American are actually made in a different country.  As Boone Chu mentions, &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be that way much longer.  Not if the world&#039;s Bigends keep at it: no borders, pretty soon there&#039;s no mirror to be on the other side of&quot; (108). Cayce&#039;s beloved Buzz Rickson&#039;s, for example, are the Japanese reproduction of classic American WWII leather jackets.  &quot;It is an imitation more real somehow than that which it emulates&quot; (11).   What does this imply about the future of culture?  How will we be able to distinguish what is &quot;us&quot; and what is the &quot;other&quot; if the &quot;other&quot; is more &quot;us&quot; than we are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;
Since I&#039;m currently working on a paper for lit theory, Pattern Recognition also made me think of Cleanth Brooks and Roland Barthes, especially after the conversation in class about the author&#039;s intent.&lt;br /&gt;
The global fascination with the film clips is reminiscent of &quot;The Entertainment&quot; in Infinite Jest.&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s incredibly ironic that Cayce has this strange allergic reaction to brands, yet Bigend wants her to help him ultimately monetize the Footage, essentially making it into a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Doer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/322</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just thinking about the discussion of how Cayce does or doesn&#039;t fit the role of the female in science-fiction in respect to how things happen to her vs her happening to things.  I want to point out the fact that she transcends these categorizations in her professional life.  On one level, she very much makes the world revolve around her, as just a simple yes or no qualifies the value of a Logo into which a lot of time and money has been put.  However, it isn&#039;t quite her that does those things.  She frequently seems more like a vessel for her perceptive logo abilities than a wielder of them. For that reason, it&#039;s hard to categorize her into either stereotypical role of active agent or reactive agent.  Indeed, I think this also plays into the fact that a lot of of people have trouble gendering her while reading the book.  Maybe the fact that she doesn&#039;t fit into the stereotypical character roles also makes it harder for her to fit into the stereotypical gender roles.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition: An Outsider&#039;s Viewpoint</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/320</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world of billboards and ad spots, and more to the point, a world of product placement, growing ever more subtle, as demonstrated by Trans in Pattern Recognition, it seems that there&#039;s no way to understand Western culture without being so thoroughly exposed to advertising that corporate mores don&#039;t draw one in to a world where one is an object of the market.  Who then, has the ability to objectively observe markets in action without abstracting them to the degree of economics?  My answer, obviously, is that Cayce, with her absurd sensitivity to trademarks, logos, and anything chic, is the ultimate outsider amidst the commercial world she physically inhabits.  She has the equivalent of a sixth sense, which allows, yea, motivates her to note and avoid that which is intended to implicitly draw her into consumerism.&lt;br /&gt;
	Yet, even with an effectively superhuman ability to avoid marketing, Cayce has to go through an amazing amount of work to maintain her position on the outside.  Her clothes, no doubt difficult to acquire, giving her specifications, must be trimmed and filed carefully (and sometimes confusedly), until they gain the status of CPUs.  Her home, as we hear of it secondhand, is nearly ascetic.  It&#039;s difficult to obtain creature comforts without the logos that mark them as luxurious.  And her outsider status marks her as an outsider.  Her anti-fashion statement may appear indie, but doesn&#039;t blend into any particular culture, and would probably impede any effort she made to gain status in any particular sphere.  It seems that her separation from any one structure, any culture, makes power irrelevant to her world.  She certainly responds negatively, or at best, ambivalently, to any situations where any power differential is imposed on her.&lt;br /&gt;
	Perhaps as an outcome of her separation from the world around her, Cayce can see patterns in the mobs around her.  Her ability to spot emerging trends goes beyond her benevolent pathology to a type of pattern recognition that, while related to her allergy, is consciously cultivated, and at which she also clearly excels.  My question is, then, what would it take for any member of Pattern Recognition&#039;s audience to stand far enough above the fray to note the patterns as Cayce does?  Or is that only a divine perspective now?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>pattern recognition reader response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/319</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading this novel, I kept thinking about how I do not like works of science fiction to be set in the reality of the time it was written in, as was done in Pattern Recognition. If a science fiction story is supposed to be set in reality, then the author will have to incorporate markers of the present reality into the story to give the readers a sense of when it is taking place - in the case of Pattern Recognition, one way in which this was accomplished was constantly dropping brand names and products. I think that it is especially problematic for science fiction works focused on technology to be set in reality because the piece of work will be quickly outdated. Now, I realize that I&#039;m probably just being way too picky because the story can still function in spite of it being dated in some ways, but for me, I would prefer science fiction works to be set in alternate realities. Here, in Pattern Recognition, Gibson tries to have his story so connected to reality that he kind of misses it in the process. As someone said in class, when he talks about the technologies of today, it seems like he does not have a full understanding of what is going on, which, at least for me, detracts from the novel. One example of this is early on in the novel when he is talking about activity in the F:F:F forum. At one point, Cayce sits down in front of Damien&#039;s computer,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;â€¦opens F:F:F and sees that the posts have indeed been flying. But also, to a certain extent, that the shit has been hitting the fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia are flaming one another again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkaboy is de facto spokesperson for the Progressives, those who assume that the footage consists of a work in progress, something unfinished and still being generated by its maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Completists, on the other hand, a relative but articulate minority, are convinced that the footage is comprised of snippets fro ma finished work, one whose maker chooses to expose it piecemeal and in nonsequential order, Mama Anarchia is the consummate Completist.&quot; (Gibson, 49)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this whole sequence was pretty laughable. His dramatic announcement that shit was hitting the fan because Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia are &quot;flaming&quot; each other came off as just ridiculous to me. First off, &quot;flaming&quot; is such an archaic and cheesy term â€“ that&#039;s like a term that was used in the beginning stages of the internet and online chatting circa 1998 or something. To top it off, he gave that sentence its own paragraph to emphasize the gravity of the situation. Next, the idea that some people are so involved and tied up in a simple forum to warrant the serious proclamation that the &quot;â€¦shit has been hitting the fan&quot; also reeks of someone who is ten years behind in internet culture. I think at one point, the internet was seen as this almost mythological place, a whole another world where anybody could talk to anybody, but nowadays the internet is so integrated into daily life that I don&#039;t think forums hold the mystical power that they once did. Thus, the idea that argument within a forum would cause this much distress seems off. Also ridiculous is the premise that there is a serious war being raged online between two intense internet gangs. I don&#039;t know, maybe it&#039;s just because of my own personal bias against the internet that I cannot take anything from it seriously. In the end, I would prefer for science fiction to take place in alternate realities. When the story takes place in an alternate reality, the author cannot really miss with anything because he or she is creating all the rules for the world. However, when the story takes place in reality and the author speculates about various technologies, he or she runs a very high risk of screwing something up, and if that happens, it can detract from the story.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Forum in Pattern Recognition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/318</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon reading William Gibson&#039;s novel &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, I noticed that the main character Cayce&#039;s life is sort-of divided into two different &quot;realms&quot;.  The first is reality, or better put her life outside in the city meeting people, working, discussing trends, etc.  The second, and the one that caught my interest, is her life and interaction on the forum, Fetish:Footage:Forum, which almost ends up being another world for Cayce and the other major posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum itself simply deals in what is called &quot;footage&quot;, essentially what seems to be porn videos of various forms and makes, but from the way that Cayce and other regular posters interact on the forum its more than just a fetish gallery.  Praise, arguments, friends, foes....the forum is a gathering place for more than just fetishists (so it seems...its not like Cayce is continually obsessed with that stuff in the novel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about the forum though, I tend to compare it to the forums that I have seen, read, and participated in...of which there are many.  Some have been for clubs and educational purposes, while others were for games and still others for random chat.  There are definitely similarities to the F:F:F (not in topic mind).  When something big comes up, the posts really do go &quot;flying&quot; (47).  I have yet to see a forum without some sort of Off Topic section as well.  And of course, the ever-popular flame wars...much like the ones between Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with forums might seem just like having conversations with people in real life, and it is true that the only physical differences are time delay and typing instead of speaking.  However, one thing I notice a lot of the time is that forums tend to bring out the extremes in people.  For some reason (and not totally unexpected), people tend to speak their minds more...oppose and argue with others to a greater degree...create topics that just keep going and going and going and never stop unless someone stops posting...(generally the flame wars, and most of the ones I&#039;ve seen never really get resolved....they just die).  So, perhaps the forum is not an ideal direct parallel to real life conversation...but it does tend to bring out the best and worst in people that one wouldn&#039;t see normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned, its to not get too involved in random forum...because it is sooo easy to spend half a lifetime in them (kinda like Cayce is here).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>reading Pattern Recognition as a postmodern novel</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/317</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class on Monday, the issue of genre classification was discussed at length.  The question was posed as to whether &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; should be read as a science fiction novel.  A glance over Gibson&#039;s previous works would have one believe that indeed, &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is a piece of science fiction genius, similar to &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  Besides the obvious observation that &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; differs greatly in style and plot from &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; I would also argue that they do not fit in the same genre.  While reading &quot;Pattern Recognition,&quot; I continually felt as though I was reading a postmodern novel as opposed to a science fiction one.  This should not be so surprising considering that elements of postmodernism and science fiction often overlap.  In fact, we read the article &quot;Cyber-punk and the Crisis of Postmodernity&quot; alongside &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  In the article, Lance Olsen writes, &quot;as Darko Suvin argues, all science fiction is by nature a &#039;literature of cognitive estrangment&#039;; and, as McHale adds, science fiction is to the postmodern what detective fiction was to modernism: it is the ontological par excellence&#039;&quot; (148).       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in 2003, &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is interesting because as opposed to most science fiction novels, it takes place in the present.  Yet the description of the present seems eerily futuristic.  &quot;Hotmail downloads four messages, none of which she feels like opening.  Her mother, three spam.  The penis enlarger is still after her, twice, and Increase Your Breast Size Dramatically&quot; (5).  Anyone who has email recognizes this experience.  And yet it still looks absurd when seen in writing.  We are living in the present but we are unable to keep up.  This disorientation of time is a significant theme throughout the novel as well as in postmodernism.  Bigend believes that we have no future or history because our present is too unstable.  When he claims that &quot;History is a best-guess narrative about what happened and when&quot; (59), I was immediately reminded of Lyotard&#039;s claim that postmodernism signified the &quot;end of metanarratives,&quot; and thus history.  Time can no longer be used as an organizing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This postmodern rejection of history is interesting to look at alongside &quot;Pattern Recognition&#039;s&quot; references to the 9/11 attacks.  For Gibson, this disaster served as a significant shift in time.  One could even read it as his end of history.  Case&#039;s memories of 9/11 coincide with the last time she saw her father.  Case nor NYC will ever be the same again.  Jean Baudrillard, a postmodern theorist who argues that there is no reality, referred to 9/11 as the &quot;absolute event.&quot;  Perhaps 9/11 was the event that threw us into the future before we were ready to deal with our present.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of style, I find &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; to be shamelessly postmodern.  Case&#039;s experiences and observations resemble a Baudrillardian simulacrum.  At one point Gibson even describes something as simulacra of simulacra of simulacra.  Of course, I instantly thought of &quot;Fight Club&quot; when the narrator refers to a copy of a copy of a copy.  Case exists in a dream-like state where reality never seems reliable.  &quot;Damien&#039;s Studio Display fill with darkness absolute.  It is as if she participates in the very birth of cinema&quot; (23).  In a scene such as this, one wonders who needs history when you can experience everything through simulacra?  The most frightening aspect of &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is that it exists in a postmodern world and we are have now entered a post-postmodern existence.  If one is to agree with the tenants of postmodernism, then &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; serves as a frightening reminder that we live in a world where we cannot rely on time or space to understand our identity.  History has ended either with the end of metanarratives or the 9/11 attacks.  Reality has been replaced by simulacra.  While Case&#039;s present may seem like the future to us, our present is in fact the future to Case.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Functionality</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/316</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A significant theme in William Gibson&#039;s &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is the functionality of dysfunction.  Cayce, as the protagonist, establishes this as an important subject.  She is cursed/blessed with strong reactions to corporate logos.  This sort of ability is frequently problematic for her.  Some logos are so offensive that they stimulate a physiological reaction in her.  Ultimately, her ability functioned like an allergy in her younger years.  When she first saw the Michelin Man in a magazine when she was a child, she puked.  And it still affects her that way.  When she &quot;finds a Michelin Man, it&#039;s white rolls executed in felt, garroted to the doorknob with a thick black cord.  Starts to scream but catches herself.&quot; (101)  Clearly there Cayce loses some amount of control because of her ability.  For instance, she frequently has to comfort herself with the mantra &quot;He took a duck in the face at two hundred and fifty knots.&quot; (101)  Really, her reactions seem a lot like psychosis, or some form of OCD.  However, the book presents the notion that these dysfunctions are really an asset.  Cayce&#039;s father starts the trend.  He was severely paranoid, but he saw his paranoia as a source of information.  He controlled his paranoia , and let it tell him things which ultimately helped him in his job.  Cayce then develops her father&#039;s train of thought further.  She believes that there is more information processing happening in the brain that what people are consciously aware of, and she believes that for her, the mammalian brain provides insights which are more than she could manage with just her consciousness. These violent reactions she has are actually the results of another process which she isn&#039;t entirely aware of, but which yields effective analysis of corporate logos.  And, amazingly, this analysis is apparently very valuable to corporations, and provides her with a career in which all she needs to do is give her impressions of logos.  Cayce&#039;s dysfunction is seen as a benefit to her in this book, because of how it is actually a very functional dysfunction.  It is a commodity to both her and the companies she freelances for.  This portrayal creates the impression that functionality takes precedence over most other things, including Cayce&#039;s own comfort.  It reveals that an oddity can be highly valued as long as it creates value.&lt;br /&gt;
	This, however, is contrasted by another theme in the book, which is the value of something that isn&#039;t functional.  This emerges most blatantly in the existence of the math grenades.  These are mechanical calculators, which, for their rarity and oddness, are extremely valuable.  They are effectively, completely obsolete, because of the advent of electronic computing, but they have value despite that.  The math grenades have value because they are historical a peculiarity, rather than anything functional.  This dynamic creates the impression that functionality and history are somehow at odds.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think this also relates to the issue of soul.  A philosophy which focuses on functionality seems like a cold &quot;soulless&quot; one, while one that embraces history seems more empathetic and &quot;soulful&quot;, because it is concerned about roots and origins.  It seems to me that this conflict between functionality and history is paralleled by some conflict in Cayce&#039;s mind about soul.  She repeatedly talks about how jetlag is the results of the soul being left behind, but when asked if she believes in the soul early in the book, she doesn&#039;t know.  It seems that she is struggling to understand whether existence is truly compassionate, or whether it&#039;s truly as lonely and cold and functional as it seems to be when she first arrives at London.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer vs. Pattern Recognition: Evolution towards Ambiguity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/315</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search revealed to me that Pattern Recognition, the eighth novel by William Gibson, was the first to be on the New York Times Bestsellers list, and the first to be set in a contemporary world instead of a fantastical one. The increased overall popularity of the more recent William Gibson novels ( as opposed to Neuromancer, whose popularity was more of a word-of-mouth cult hit ) may be due to this; however, speaking personally, I found the contemporary world of Pattern Recognition less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing about Gibson&#039;s work is that it is so incredibly dense and detailed, convoluted with tech-slang and computer jargon everywhere. &quot; Cognitive estrangement &quot;, as mentioned in the first week; making a fictional world so strange that it forces us to re-examine the way we think about reality. Neuromancer&#039;s early-cyberspace world does this with its advanced technologies and virtual worlds. Pattern Recognition tries to do the same. Unfortunately, Pattern Recognition takes it too far, by creating a world ( ironically, even more &quot; grounded &quot; in our reality ) that&#039;s so alien that the message is lost in its own convolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, may well be the point. Gibson may be trying to show us that the future ( which we are living in now ) is even more alien and disconnected than we ever could have imagined. But the narrative didn&#039;t communicate this to me as well. Neuromancer may have been talking about a profoundly artificial world, but it did so through a more traditional narrative-- a designated ( if not actually ) heroic protagonist on an action-packed adventure, who ends up changing the world at large. The characters may have been thinner and more cliche, but they were identifiable-- familiar &quot; cliches &quot; to ground very unfamiliar ideas. The cast of Pattern Recognition are more complex, but also much harder to define, and thus I think the power of the statements in the book are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit: Case is an anti-heroic super-hacker, a &quot; console cowboy &quot; who could be a typical video game hero. Cayce is a design-sensitive marketing consultant who explores metropolitan board meetings, club scenes, and hotel arrangements in an attempt to find context and understanding in her multimedia world. More complex, but almost paralyzingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>dialect &amp; language in midnight robber</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/314</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, as the end-of-year-tiredness sets in, I keep on forgetting to do these...sorry about that...anyway, I was in the second group of presenters on Wednesday, and I was the one who talked about dialect and the use of language in the novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that I noticed while preparing my topic were the correlations drawn between the colonization of Toussaint, the impregnation of a woman, and planting fertile soil. I used two quotes, one from the very beginning of the novel about the arrival of Granny Nanny on the already-inhabited planet: &quot;...like God entering he woman; plunging into the womb of soil to impregnate the plant with the seed of Granny Nanny&quot;(pp.2) and another in which Tan-Tan is explaining her pregnancy: &quot;[My father] rape me...He put this baby in me...He was forever trying to plant me, like I was his soil to harvest&quot;(pp.260) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I noticed at first is that both images seem to allude to rape, especially since the woman (or female-gendered entity, in the case of the land) is treated as an object to be possessed, such as when God enters &quot;he&quot; woman, meaning &quot;his&quot;. However, I&#039;m aware that this can sound like a sexist assumption against men; particularly since God is the one doing the impregnating in the first instance. But, when we&#039;re talking about colonization, we are talking about something forced. I didn&#039;t get to bring this up in class, but one could argue that organized religion is more of an oppressive force than a compassionate representation of God.&lt;br /&gt;
I think that exploring possible rape is an important part of recognizing the struggles of women in a colonized society; but even more interesting are the references to planting, which suggests a positive, life-giving force connected to the rape. This positive light would make more sense if the colonization and/or sexual acts occurred with mutual consent, but clearly that isn&#039;t the case. Perhaps this alludes to the fact that natives of the Caribbean were considered &quot;savages&quot; and told by colonists that their subjugation to &quot;civilized&quot; society was &quot;for their own good&quot; and meant to help them grow or evolve? I think this sounds plausible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&#039;t get much of a response in class, but I was also intrigued by the stream-of-consciousness, almost hip-hop-like language used by the Robber King that Tan-Tan and her mother run into. What is a reader supposed to take from a sentence like &quot;I wrestle the warptenned flying shit from the ensorcelled dungmaster, the master plan blaster in his silver-fendered stratocaster with wings of phoenix flame...&quot; (pp.56). At first I was completely confused; what do Stratocasters and phoenixes have to do with anything? The narration explains that these speeches were always re-told stories about escaping the horrors  of slavery and surviving after their land had been colonized. In other words, it is like a dialect within a dialect; a way of remembering their struggles that their colonizers will not understand and therefore cannot condemn.&lt;br /&gt;
This extremely high level of adaptability is fascinating; when a group of people (by extension this is probably referring to blacks in America) are colonized, enslaved or taken over, they merely mix parts of the conquering culture with their own and continue as before...they are not broken.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>language in Pattern Recongition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/313</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;ve been reading Pattern Recognition, and I&#039;ve noticed that Gibson writes with what I perceive to be a British tone, with British vernacular - &quot;bin it&quot; rather than &quot;throw it away,&quot; &quot;come round&quot; instead of &quot;stop by&quot; or &quot;go over,&quot; casual use of the often-still-forbidden-in-America &quot;C-word&quot;, stuff like that.  However, he is apparently from Vancouver.  Is he affecting a British tone because it&#039;s set in London, or do Canadians speak/write more British than American?  It seems a really silly/trivial question, but it&#039;s been bothering me and I&#039;m supercurious now.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>little things</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to comment on the time-space things that bothered me in Midnight Robber.  I thought it was interesting how the two parallel worlds developed to be entirely the same, except in one, the humans colonized, and in the other, they didn&#039;t.  It implies to me that there is something about humans which makes them extra-temporal.  Somehow, everything but humans are constrained to carry out the same rolls in these two separate universes.  To me, it implies that there is a physical and tangible aspect to human free-will.  Does this work into the other theme of nanny granny taking playing with human free-will?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>quick question</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/311</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;If we wrote a reading response for Neuromancer, do we write another for Pattern Recognition or no, since it&#039;s another Gibson? (same question goes for Oryx and Crake/Atwood)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gender role confusion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/310</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s an interesting construction of gender roles in Midnight Robber.  Nalo Hopkinson seems to be paying a certain amount of lip service to the idea that in the future envisioned, people will be able to choose their roles and occupations regardless of gender.  She accomplishes this sometimes by reference to olden times in which roles were more stratified, as when the eshu tries to explain to a confused Tan-Tan how once, women weren&#039;t allowed to play the Midnight Robber.  Tan-Tan&#039;s confusion reflects her complete expectation that what she will be able to do will be unrelated to her gender.  Similarly, Hopkinson breaks stereotypes about women&#039;s ability to do hard manual labor with frequent reference to the physical strength of her female characters.  Even Ione is described at least once in terms of her musculature, and the original runner is female.&lt;br /&gt;
	At the same time, Antonio at least has very strong expectations of the roles that will be taken by the women around him.  In Toussaint, he expects his affairs to go unremarked, but explodes over Ione&#039;s.  In New Half-Way Tree, he retires from the fields, but cannot believe that Janisette would want him to take care of chickens, or  a garden.  Originally, it seemed possible that this stratification was limited to him, but the staff of the house in Toussaint, the cultured, and thus presumably more progressive, world, take for granted his dual-standard of sexual behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
	An interesting thing about the move to New Half-Way Tree is that the rougher lifestyle and the need to physically work there seems to bring out the disparities in expectations for men and women.  Men consistently seem to enforce law, instead of the feminized figure of Granny Nanny, and the word slut is used openly.&lt;br /&gt;
	On that level, the douen and the hinte, who have openly, directly separated tasks for men and women based on their physical competencies, seem much more sophisticated.  This is particularly true because they seem to have found a balance of power within their roles, rather than the humans, who live in a much more clearly male-dominated society.  What male domination we see among the douen appears to be an artifact of Tan-Tan&#039;s perspective, having seen the packbirds so long as non-sentient.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>schedule changes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/308</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so as I mentioned in class today, I&#039;ve got to cancel class next Wednesday due to an emergency meeting I have to attend.  I want to propose the following options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  We spend Monday, April 21, discussing Gibson and the secondary criticism as listed on the syllabus, but I order pizza and we stay until as close to 1.15 as we possibly can, so that both Monday&#039;s and Wednesday&#039;s groups can present on Monday, and we can finish with Gibson in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  We leave Monday&#039;s class just as it&#039;s currently scheduled, and instead extend class on Monday, April 28, spending the first chunk of class on Gibson before turning to Atwood.  Pizza, ditto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  We find some time -- Friday, May 2? -- to schedule an extra class session.  Probably a pizza-oriented enticement could be arranged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please register votes (or list additional options) in the comments...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Duality in Midnight Robber</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/306</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the existence of two parallel universes in MR, it&#039;s an enticing idea to contrast the two â€“ each as offering its own different form of oppression, for example. Toussaint, while a diverse, safe (thanks to Granny Nanny), and relatively utopian-like civilization, gives up privacy to the point that one &quot;couldn&#039;t even take a piss without the toilet analyzing the chemical composition of the urine and logging the data in the health records&quot; (10). New Half-Way Tree, in contrast, offers a return to nature where freedom comes with the trade-off of facing myriad wild beasts with less technology at one&#039;s disposal. Opportunities for dualistic analysis appear easy and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, MR follows a generally cyclical pattern that crosses boundaries freely between the two worlds, particularly in relation to the Robber Queen myth and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw-away myths such as that seen in &quot;How Tan-Tan Learn to Thief&quot; link together the characters in ways that inform the reader (consider the foreshadowing of Tan-Tan marrying Antonio or how Tan-Tan forcing her neglectful mother to become her maid reveals hidden resentment) but take place outside of the main narrative. Yet in the cylical interconnectedness of MR, myths of the &quot;Robber Queen&quot; play a large part in Tan-Tan&#039;s childhood â€“ at one point she refuses to change out of a Robber Queen costume for two days straight (30). Faced with abuse by her father, Tan-Tan transforms into the myth herself to be free: &quot;It must have been the Robber Queen who pulled out the knife. Antonio raised up to shove into the person on the bed again. It must have been the Robber Queen, the oulaw woman, who quick like a snake got the knife braced at her breastbone just as Antonio slammed his heavy body right onto the blade&quot; (168). Tan-Tan becomes the myth whose stories shaped her childhood. All of this takes place within the broader context of a cultural tradition of heroes &quot;escaping the horrors of slavery and making their way into brigandry as a way of surviving in the new and terrible white devils&#039; land in which they&#039;d found themselves&quot; (57). Stories from 17th century Afro-Carribean myth, Touissant &#039;real life&#039;, Touissant myth, New Half-Way Tree &#039;real life&#039;, and New Half-Way Tree myth blur into one another, sharing stories, characters, and motifs (e.g. wisdom trumps physicality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Hopkinson&#039;s unique ways of storytelling blend these &#039;separate halves&#039; together. The dialect remains constant throughout, and numerous changes in style (between the boldfaced nanny-narrator, 3rd person, boldfaced douen-speech) blur together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find parallels between this novel&#039;s celebration of a traditionally oppressed culture and the revolutionary picture of gender in Le Guin&#039;s The Left Hand of Darkness. As both break free from restricing systems of oppression, both create worlds in which &quot;the whole tendency to dualism that pervades human thinking may be found to be lessened, or changed&quot; (94).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Time Travel in Midnight Robber?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/305</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing Midnight Robber, I got to thinking.  There is a lot of talk about how New Half-Way Tree is in a different dimension.  What if instead it was in a different time?  I don&#039;t know exactly what that adds to the work, but it seems to fit better, and explain current Touissant more fully.&lt;br /&gt;
I started thinking about time travel instead of dimensional travel when I first read about the shift pods.  While fairly stock, they made it clear that they were not really moving through space.  The explanation was that they moved through dimensions, but it seemed far easier to explain that they were moving back in time.  I think that New Half-Way Tree is Touissant, but back in time a few hundred years.  This makes it more obvious why the myths of the Midnight Robber and Robber Queen spread so easily.  They could easily have been already passed on to the people of Touissant when they arrived, and found there way into myth enough that eventually Tan-Tan had the motivation to perform acts of legend.  This theory also explains why many of the larger animals are extinct on Touissant, and the Mako Jumbie bird had been domesticated.  There is plenty of time to domesticate the bird if New Half-Way Tree is set a few hundred years back.  It also explains the absence of the Douen, because they could have been eradicated by the humans of New Half-Way Tree before the colony ships ever arrived, relegating them to myths before the culture of Touissant could exert itself.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, this explanation is slightly debunked by Hopkinson&#039;s own narrative.  She does talk about the other dimension a lot throughout the work.  Since this is mostly humans talking, there is no problem with just explaining it as human ignorance.  However, Hopkinson also talks about Grammy Nanny searching through the dimensions to find Tan-Tan, a description that wouldn&#039;t make as much sense if New Half-Way Tree was just back in time.  The time difference though does explain why Grammy Nanny cannot affect anything that happens on New Half-Way tree.  Grammy Nanny would not be able to affect anything before she was created.  This would make the scene with the shift pods more believable too, because the eshu kept talking to Tan-Tan for a reasonable length of time while in the shift pod.  If the shift pod was traveling back in time, then the eshu would have a reasonable amount of time before the pod went to a time before it was created.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, in the end, time travel doesn&#039;t seem all that likely.  There is only one reason why Hopkinson would state that it was dimensional travel instead of time travel; to show an interesting recursive myth creation that would not add all that much to the story, and create weird paradoxes.  If the myths that Tan-Tan was told were about her it would create a lot of pre-determinism that doesn&#039;t really fit into the story. I like to think that the time travel works, but it doesn&#039;t add enough to the story to justify me shoehorning it into Hopkinson&#039;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>deities in &quot;midnight robber&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/303</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting, yet very briefly discussed, differences between the inhabitants born on Toussaint and those whose ancestry traces far back on New Half-Way Tree is the concept of a higher power, the god-figure.  The humans have Granny-Nanny while the douens have Father Bois.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, this difference can be attributed to the realities from which each species originates.  The douen live in a massive tree that provides them with food, shelter, and water.  If the tree did not take on some level of godhood, it would be confusing.  The humans, contrastingly, are in a technological world, where Granny Nanny is literally inside your head, inescapably from birth.  The Eshu in some respects reminded me of angels.  They are the mouth pieces for Granny-Nanny, who is somewhat incapable of directly speaking to the humans (i.e. the eshu are Alan Rickman in Dogma).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something deeper than this, though.  When the humans are sent to New Half-Way Tree, they are very clearly severed from the Granny-Nanny network, yet they still invoke Granny Nanny much the same people in our world today invoke God in times of mild frustration, taking the name as an oath.  Granny does, however, manage to break through the dimensional barrier (again, godlike omnipresence) and implant herself in Tubman, sowing the seeds for a somewhat perverted messianic story.  The fact that Tubman is a child of incest, and thus of only one parental bloodline, also feeds into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The douens, on the other hand, see Father Bois as a benevolent figure who simply nurtures and loves.  Chichibud says to Tan-Tan when he finds her under her dead father, &quot;Papa Bois see what really happen in that room, Tan-Tan.  He ain&#039;t judging you&quot; (172).  When he takes her to the home tree, the incarnation of Papa Bois, Chichibud tells Tan-Tan to come in peace and go in friendship (179).  When the douen feel forced to cut down Father Bois, the tree reincarnates with unbelievable speed, creating a strong sense of the a messianic creature, but different from Tubman.  Where Tubman is a bridge, the tree seems to be what is waiting on the other side of the bridge, the incarnation of the return to paradise when creatures are redeemed from The Fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when Father Bois interacts with the mythic Tan-Tan and Antonio and creates the original Half-Way Tree, there is something vengeful in him at that moment as well.  It seems that there is something inherent to the humans that prevents them from experiencing unconditional benevolence and love from any deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this dichotomy parallels the versions of God in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  The humans are associated with the vengeful, powerful God of the Old Testament, whereas the douen are a far more peaceful people in and of themselves, and thus can better accept and comprehend the loving, forgiving God of the New Testament.  Taking things away from the Christian Bible, the douen also seem to have developed more f a oneness with nature, whereas the humans fight it, and thus incite conflict from the forces that surround and govern them.  It seems that once again man&#039;s inherent hierarchical tendencies and the violence that springs from these tendencies will be his downfall and stumbling block, no matter where he goes or how low he is dragged down.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>race war?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/300</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;From the start, the relationship between humans and douen bears strong overtones of real-life race relations. Characteristic of both white-black and European-Native American relations are played out, although in each case the analogy is imperfect. Both are represented by the quick judgment by humans that the douen are inferior. Antonio, for example, starts out his relationship with Chichibud by calling the latter a beast, to which he responds &quot;Oonuh tallpeople quick to name what is people and what is beast.&quot; (92) This is certainly reminiscient of justifications for slavery, which tended to emphasize the inferiority and essential inhumanity of the slaves. Similarly, the subjugation of Native Americans was freqently justified by essentially racist ideas like manifest destiny, which was based on the presumption that land was the white man&#039;s to do with as he wished. The humans at the first settlement have similar ideas, as they expect duoen to call them &quot;boss&quot; and laugh at the idea of calling them Compere (which I assume is a term of respect, like &#039;sir,&#039; although I&#039;m not really sure).&lt;br /&gt;
	The duoen are clearly fearful of this type of human attitude, as Chichibud reveals right after Tan-Tan stmbles upon the foundry: &quot;Tan-Tan, if douens don&#039;t learn tallpeople tricks, oonuh will use them &#039;pon we...we see how allyou does act, even towards your own.&quot; (230-231) Here, though, is where the parallels fade a little. Unlike Africans, the duoen are not being taken from their homes to live in a society dominated by another race. Unlike Native Americans, they are not being invaded by an organized enemy. The humans come in one by one or in small groups, apparently with only what they can carry. There is no threat of a mass migration - no one on the other side of the portal would want to cross. It is unclear exactly how numerous the duoen are, but one has to assume that they vastly outnumber the humans. Additionally, they have taken the extremely prescient step of trading for knowledge as much as for goods. They trade for human artifacts, but they use them to learn as much as for their value as tools. To make a long story short, the duoen appear to be well on their way to winningany encounter with humans, misadventures at their papa tree notwithstanding (there, they seemed handicapped as much by their desire to avoid killing humans as by weakness). I would love to read a sequel to this novel merely to see how this situation develops, and how the human assumption of superiority fails when presented with experience to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 8</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/299</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#039;s because I just finished writing a ten-page paper on incest, but I can&#039;t help but focus on the relationship between Antonio and Tan-Tan.  Throughout the beginning of the novel, I thought that my final paper topic was the reason that I was reading so much into their relationship.  When the abuse was revealed, I found myself comparing it to that of Lore and her mother from Slow River.&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&#039;t really see Catherine&#039;s abuse coming, in all honesty.  I feel like I simply couldn&#039;t anticipate a mother abusing her daughter.  If you look back through the novel, the clues are absurdly honest: I mean, the interaction at the fountain is pretty blatant.  However, I made up reasons for why Stella might verbally attack her mother.  The one that I finally settled on was that Catherine knew about her husband&#039;s abuse and kept silent.  I didn&#039;t even consider the fact that Catherine might be responsible for the actual abuse.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I instantly assumed that Antonio was abusing Tan-Tan, even though the clues were much more subtle in Midnight Robber than in Slow River.  Why is it that I was so much readier to put the abuse in the father&#039;s hands than in the mother&#039;s?&lt;br /&gt;
We talk so much in class about the negative constraints that our society puts on female gender concepts.  Obviously, there are negative stereotypes about women.  However, there are also some terrible images of men that our society has perpetuated.  After reading dozens of books on the societal construction of incest and the oppression of our patriarchal society, I can&#039;t help but be a little bit disgusted by the instant assumption that a father will be the abusive member of the parental couple. Of course, it&#039;s possible that the fault is all within me--maybe others&#039; minds didn&#039;t instantly jump to the fact that Lore&#039;s father was the abuser.  But it seems to me that that was the whole shock value of the abuse in Slow River--the reader wasn&#039;t supposed to guess that it was Lore&#039;s father.&lt;br /&gt;
On another note (away from incest), I was surprised that Midnight Robber didn&#039;t have the same slightly-cheesy fairy-tale vibe of Slow River.  Although there was a mythological vibe, made obvious by the interjections of story-telling between Tan-Tan&#039;s own narration.  However, it didn&#039;t have the same happily-ever-after ending of Slow River.  I&#039;m not sure exactly why I didn&#039;t get the same vibe from Midnight Robber as Slow River.  both have female characters going through trials and tribulations and coming out better in the end.  The ending leaves almost no room for negativity--Tan-Tan is obviously already a legend, and her son, Tubman, lives long enough to be told stories about his epic mother.  I think I might have liked Midnight Robber more because the character of Tan-Tan is actually pretty likeable.  Lore, in contrast, is both pretty dull and relatively impossible to like at times--I mean, come on! She makes porn with her friends&#039; faces!&lt;br /&gt;
Because I felt so emotionally attached to Tan-Tan, I found myself liking the ending of Midnight Robber much more.  I wanted things to end well for her--I wanted her child to grow up and escape any hint of the memory of his grandfather&#039;s abuse.  I think that Nalo Hopkinson managed to write a story with a happy ending without sounding cheesy, something that is pretty damn hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>There&#039;s some literary word for this writing style, but I forget what it was</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/298</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Midnight Robber is a novel set apart from most other works of science fiction in its use of a non-Anglo-Saxon culture as the predominant society of its world.  Science Fiction often deals with issues of individuals set apart from the rest of society or set in unfamiliar surroundings, trying to find their way, and so it is somewhat surprising that there are so few examples of Science fiction works written through the lenses of cultures outside of the western/American norm.  Nalo Hopkinson presents a future in which Carribean culture and influence dominates, built through her use of Creole narration and mythologies that depart from westernized norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most conspicuous representation of the novel&#039;s Carribian viewpoint is the use of Creole Language by characters and the Narrative.  The very intro of the book begins with some text describing the main character that, at first glance, might be confused for improper grammar, or just seem incomprehensible for a long while:  &quot;The only thing soft about Tan-Tan is she big, molasses-brown eyes that could look on you, and your heart would start to beat time boopaloops with every flutter of she long eyelashes.  One look in she eyes, and you fall for she already,&quot; (1-2).  Once a reader comes to understanding the grammar structures and wording methodologies a bit better, though, the text becomes almost as easy to read as regular English prose, but gives the added cultural element to keep the reader immersed in the story.  The character dialogues are similarly presented in Creole, keeping the image that the entire world, not just our main character, is based upon Carribean culture rather than western societal constructs.  One exchange goes as follows: &quot; &#039;I not leaving you!&#039; &#039;She not going anywhere with you, you pissant wretch!&#039; &#039;Go, Melonhead, or it just go be worse!&#039; &#039;You sure?&#039; &#039;Yes! I go come talk to you later,&#039; &quot; (166).  As previously mentioned, this at first glance appears to be bad grammar, but gives an authenticity otherwise completely lost by correcting the speech patterns of Creole pidgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkinson further involves Creole by using mythologies based in the realm of the novel and its Carribean roots.  The majority of tales involve trickery, or &quot;anansi story&quot; as it is called in the introduction, referring to an African legend of Anansi the Spider, a great being who greatly helped out mankind but also was a trickster.  In the tale of Tan-Tan and Dry Bone, the entire plot is centered around the two characters trying to out-trick each other to get their way; In Dry Bone&#039;s case to be perpetually cared for by Tan-Tan, and Tan-Tan trying to get rid of him.  Tan-Tan finally wins out by tricking Dry Bones to going out onto her porch by weaving an image of a veranda suited for a king, playing to his ego to bring about his downfall at the hands of Master Johncrow, who takes Dry Bone away into the sky (211).  While Western myths deal with trickery, the Carribean and African influenced myths present in the story seem almost entirely comprised of subterfuge as a means to all ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midnight Robber&#039;s basis in Carribean and African culture allow for a more immersive reading experience, and help to create a realm that is, sadly, more alien than most standard works of science fiction which are based on western culture.  By taking readers into this other culture, she can create a fictitious world with so many real world elements, yet still have it be alien and unique.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Midnight Robber finds another frontier</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/297</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nalo Hopkinson, (though a web search reveals her to be a relative new author), seems to have made her unique mark on Science Fiction largely because that voice is grounded in the rhythms, myths, and vernacular of Caribbean and Creole cultures.  I mean, she is clearly not the only Science Fiction author to bring a recognizable contemporary culture other than American-flavored Caucasian to the SciFi stage, but let&#039;s face it:  Name another SciFi writer of African heritage besides Delaney and Butler.  Now remember the languages they used in Stars and Lilith: they were quite different from Hopkinson, dense in a style we associate with Western academic and avant-garde discourse (in the case of Delaney) or somewhat removed as per the Western scientific approach (so that&#039;s a little too simple to describe Butler, but you get the idea).   Admittedly, though we may feel that the use of dialects is a sort of &quot;gimmick&quot; we&#039;ve seen before, I think it&#039;s important to note the way in which the sheer immersion in and weaving of dialects and textual/cultural artifacts makes Science Fiction new for us again in this novel, and starts to blend the realms of media produced to raise cultural awareness (I&#039;m thinking here of the tradition of avant-garde African-American and Caribbean documentary filmmaking, of which The Last Angel of History seems to stand as a good example, though it&#039;s apparently British?) and the &quot;pop&quot; genere of Science fiction.  *** I&#039;m so excited!  I&#039;m an odd fan of African-American and Afro-Cribbean documentary and art cinema (says the sheltered young white college student from Idaho) for its honesty, depth, feeling, power, and occasional bluntness.  To see some of these tendencies leak out and start shaping a wad of Sci Fi, one of my favorite literary genres, isâ€¦well, exciting.***  Seriously people.  Midnight Robber struck me as taking us deeper, making newness inevitable on a linguistic and cultural front by forcing us to explore new worlds in more than one sense.  Importantly, I think we should note that by using that dialect not only for the characters, but at times for the narration itself, Hopkinson is stepping beyond a boundary many writers have opted not to cross.  She&#039;s written bridging sections entirely in Creole, framing the main story with legends and background information, slipping Caribbean vocabulary and rhythms into her narration.&lt;br /&gt;
	What&#039;s most impressive to me  is how she controls her use of dialect. While the characters speak a consistent patois, the dialect ebbs and flows in Hopkinson&#039;s expository writing. By carefully varying whether each sentence is in standard English, Creole or a combination of the two languages, she shifts elegantly from simple events to emotional viewpoints, highlighting action or slowing other scenes down.  There is power in bridging cultures, and a unique viewpoint that can only be achieved by straddling cultural chasms.  However, Hopkinson&#039;s use of Caribbean myth extends beyond mere language. The space-age legends she has created provide clues about the history of the Toussaint colony and explain the sometimes unusual attitudes and actions of the characters. This subtle approach seems pretty common in science fiction, but we readers are still forced to work out the meanings of each legend for ourselves before we can connect the stories back to the colony&#039;s present-day life. It&#039;s extra detective work, but it&#039;s fun.  YES FUN.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Importance of language</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/296</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What struck me most about Nalo Hopkinson&#039;s Midnight Robber was not any of the obvious subjects addressed in the novel: race and gender issues, rape, incest, self-love, self-respect, etc; rather, the language she used to discuss these things was so exact in its strange dialect and such a crucial part of the novel. In most of the novels we have read thus far, there is some strange vocabulary that helps define the strange world we read about, but in general, the language in which the author tells the story is easily understandable. It is not so in Midnight Robber, where this Afro-Caribbean dialect is not reserved for dialogue but used in narration as well. The effect of this is that the reader must constantly pay attention to what is being said or he will miss the meaning of the words. Indeed, as I was reading it, if I started to scan paragraphs I would have to go back and re-read them because I really couldn&#039;t understand what had just happened in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are certain words that, like previous SF novels, are completely made up by the author. &quot;Headblind,&quot; &quot;nannysong,&quot; &quot;eshu,&quot; and &quot;datastock&quot; are a few of these. &quot;Headblind&quot; refers to objects or situations that Granny Nanny, the omniscient and omnipresent computer, doesn&#039;t have access to; in other words, she is blind to them. One such item is real paper; the current equivalent, which Granny Nanny does have access to, is datastock, something that seems similar to word processing for documents. The sing-song phrases used to communicate with Granny Nanny and the house eshu are called nannysong, for obvious reasons. The eshu is a little less obvious; similar to Granny Nanny, it seems, it has no physical presence but exists within the &quot;living&quot; house simply as a.i. consciousness, and can control much of how the house operates (ie changing walls into mirrors when asked). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These made-up words are expected, almost clichÃ© when it comes to science fiction, but real words--at least slang that is actually used in certain dialects--is not, and is much harder to read. In fact, it is unclear whether many of the unknown words are Hopkinson&#039;s creation or real slang, though probably the latter. &quot;Allyou&quot; is a pretty obvious word; a much better known term would be &quot;y&#039;all,&quot; and certainly means the same thing. On the other hand, &quot;pickney&quot; takes a while to figure out, but seems to refer to children, especially young and tricky ones. While &quot;doux-doux&quot; is unfamiliar to most Americans, it is not really slang, as it comes from the French word that means &quot;sweet,&quot; and is obviously used as a term of endearment. &quot;Nuh&quot; and &quot;seen&quot; are a bit more difficult, however; &quot;nuh&quot; is apparently used similarly to its cousin &quot;no&quot; as questioning the previous statement. &quot; &#039;Daddy, let we go home, nuh?&#039; &quot; (Hopkinson 72). Here, the equivalent would be, &quot;Can&#039;t we go home?&quot; Conversely, &quot;seen&quot; is a statement of agreement or acknowledgment (like &quot;okay&quot;), wherein the speaker has &quot;seen&quot; the import of the listener&#039;s previous words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary is not the only confusing part of Hopkinson&#039;s language, however; the grammar is what makes the novel truly difficult to read, at least until one has gotten used to it. For instance, possessive pronouns are most often the same as our usual subject pronouns: &quot;She two arms hard with muscle . . .&quot; (1); and subject and object pronouns seem to have switched places: &quot; &#039;Them does only pay a pittance compared to we&#039; &quot; (8). Subject and verb are sometimes switched, verb form is seldom &quot;correct&quot;--in all, it can be quite a confusing read for anyone. What we must consider is, since books are meant to be read (and this one is likely intended for an audience who does not speak the novel&#039;s dialect), why make it so difficult to read? For one thing, the main aspect of culture lies in its language, so Hopkinson immerses the reader into her obviously different world immediately. Moreover, and more importantly, because the language makes the reader stumble and pick his way through, it forces him to concentrate better on what is being said. True, the reading will get easier as he makes his way through the novel and gets used to its style, but it still will catch him if he starts slacking off in attention because it is never a natural way of forming sentences in his brain. In this way, Hopkinson achieves the ultimate goal of an author: to make her reader immerse himself completely in the story and concentrate on what she is telling him.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ultimate Tree House People</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/295</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon reading a science fiction book that creates a new sentient species, it is always interesting to consider how that species differs from humans, as the departure from a human model is a commentary on how the author views humankind.  Specifically, it usually points out the perceived flaws in human interactions, politics, overall behavior, and response to environment.  In creating the douen as a sentient race, which were already a well-established myth in Caribbean culture (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&quot; title=&quot;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&quot;&gt;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&lt;/a&gt;), Hopkinson continued her pattern of using folk lore and mythical characters as main players in her book, but redefined, showing the myths as extrapolated from a more science fiction type truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was touched on somewhat briefly in class on Monday, the treatment of the Douen by the exiled Toussaint humans echoed the African slave experience and illuminated the way in which humans manage to come up with irrational validation to treat others as sub-human.  Little Tan-Tan was so surprised at the use of &quot;master&quot; towards the humans, when Chichibud says it, because she sees Chichibud as just another kind of person.  She had not yet learned the human tendency to equate difference with inferiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about the douen that was interesting was the drastic difference between male and female within the species.  In superficially examining this difference, Hopkinson&#039;s purpose is unclear (at least to me).  As a species the distinctions are very useful because the humans do not expect such a deviation based on gender within a species, since it is difficult to think of a single species on Earth that varies that much within itself based on sex.  Also, from a practical perspective, the ability to use them as pack animal, transportation, protection, sonic weapon, radar, and manufacturer of trade goods, is indispensable.  It can be supposed that from a biological perspective the split of male as reptilian and female as bird is not completely removed from the realm of possibility, considering the study of dinosaurs being closely related to reptiles and birds.  There is a magical component in the douen culture, even though Chichibud&#039;s initial claims of magic turn out to have been stories for the young Tan-Tan.  There was the medicine, which is so much more affective than the medicine the Toussaint people used.  The daddy tree was also somewhat magical, providing for virtually all of the needs of the douen people in a perfectly symbiotic relationship.  Specifically the absence of technology in the douen culture makes them seem more magical, as other alien species are traditionally reliant on technological advancement for their super human abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of existing myths to build a species must have made Hopkinson&#039;s job somewhat easier, but they do depart drastically from the original lore.  However, the use of folk lore enriched her creations and her story by creating a many layered mythology within the book&#039;s fiction that seems to become deeper the more one knows about Caribbean culture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>peer review</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/292</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few notes on the peer review process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, if you don&#039;t have a partner as yet, please leave a comment on this post; there are likely other folks looking for partners to work with, too.  If we wind up with only one person who seems unpaired, I&#039;d appreciate it if a group would expand to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as you read your partner&#039;s draft, comment by hand in the margins, of course, but you should also type out a coherent general response to the paper overall.  A helpful response to your partner&#039;s draft will likely include comments on all or most of the following issues.  The list below is for your convenience; you needn&#039;t address each item one after the other, though you may do so if it makes things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify what appears to be the present draft&#039;s thesis or overall point.  If you aren&#039;t sure exactly what it is, list the most likely possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tell the author whether her thesis is interesting to you or not.  Does it add anything substantive to your understanding of the novel(s) in question?  If not, you might suggest ways to make the argument more interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If, on the other hand, the overall thesis seems to you implausible, or unconvincing, or if you can see serious objections to it that the author hasn&#039;t addressed, say so, and detail why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Describe, in no more than one short paragraph, the overall argument that&#039;s advanced in support of the thesis (in other words, how the author goes about constructing her thesis).  If this seems impossible, explain why -- try to identify areas you find confusing or unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify two parts of the overall argument that seem comparatively strong, persuasive, or effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify two parts of the overall argument that seem comparatively weak, unpersuasive, or ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Does the author use any abstract terms or phrases whose precise meanings in the paper aren&#039;t clear to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  How well do the draft&#039;s parts fit together?  Is the author doing a good job of moving the reader coherently from one part of the argument to another?  If not, try to identify some places where you got disoriented or couldn&#039;t figure out quite where in the discussion you were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Does the author&#039;s use of details and quotations from the primary text(s) and/or secondary sources seem effective?  Do some of the quotations seem stuck in merely to satisfy the research requirements of this assignment?  Are any quotations unnecessarily long?  Are quotations introduced well, woven smoothly into the author&#039;s own prose, or do they just seem to hang there awkwardly?  Do you know how the author interprets the key ideas of each quote she uses, and how those ideas connect to her argument?  Are the quotations correctly punctuated and cited?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify (in the margins of the draft if not in the letter) any basic syntactic, usage, punctuation, spelling, or typographical errors.  Since final drafts may be penalized if they contain such egregious errors, you&#039;ll be doing your partner a service by catching those errors now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  As your partner goes forward to revise this draft, give her at least two general suggestions for making the paper better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have questions...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hopkinson&#039;s Anti-Posthumanism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/291</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a topic we talked about a little in class today, but since my paper is on posthumanism, I&#039;m having a little trouble thinking about anything else, so I&#039;m going to go for it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;
To my mind, this is one of the most anti-posthumanist novels we&#039;ve read thus far in the class, which I find most interesting considering just how little the novel exposes us to advanced technology, since most of the storyline takes place in the primitive society of New Half-Way Tree.  Hopkinson does a little bit of the typical anti-transhumanism presentation in the obvious perversity of a theoretically positive advance. Generally speaking, I get so caught up in the storyline of a novel that I have a hard time picking up on subtle undertones, components of a universe that are overtly presented as positive, when really maybe we&#039;re supposed to see them as nefarious.  I have the worst time with unpleasant technological advances, because my first inclination is to think of technology as progressive.  But when Ione realizes the sheriffs are arresting Antonio and says &quot;Nanny save we!&quot; I was profoundly disturbed (64).  The grand anansi is so powerful, that its nickname is used in place of God.  It happens again, after he finds out Quashee is dead, Antonio says &quot;Nanny have mercy&quot; where the implied continued thought is â€¦on my soul (70).  Nanny has become so pervasive that people are essentially praying to a machine for salvation.  There&#039;s also the very creepy final passage, when we realize that the nanobots have made their way into Tan-Tan&#039;s child, without Tan-Tan&#039;s consent, let alone the child&#039;s.&lt;br /&gt;
I also see the novel as anti-transhumanist in its absolute corporeality. One of the overarching goals for posthumanists is to fully disengage from the body, and become an unbounded entity in cyberspace, or some analogous structure, as we saw with Case in Neuromancer.  Nalo Hopkinson rejects disembodiment and fully embraces the importance of corporal reality.  We see this, as mentioned in class, in the fact that the technology (nanomites) inhabits the body, rather than having the mind moving into cyberspace.  I also see it in Tan-Tan&#039;s pregnancy.  Incorporating such a purely physical phenomenon into the story reinforces the importance of the corporal over the ethereal.  I also read Brown Girl in the Ring, and see a similar trend in that novel as well.  Again, the human bodies are possessed, and actually physically changed by the spirits.  The main character resolves a conflict by hands-on fighting, which we haven&#039;t seen much of previously in this class.  In an altered state, she lifts a man off the ground with two fingers.  The most powerful force in the book, the duppy-bowl is powered by human blood rather than code, thoughts, or information, and to break its power, the main character has to break a physical object, which, once broken, reveals all the physical things its made of: &quot;reeking clumps of dirt; a twist of hair; white knuckle bones; the black, mummified body of what looked like a dead cat&quot; (204).  The final showdown then makes the conflict explicit.  The villain says &quot;that body don&#039;t have to be your home no more. You don&#039;t have to feel pain no more, sweetheart.  Your granddaddy could help you.  After I speak the right words, the powder you take will give your spirit strength to act on it own, without the body.  Let your spirit talk to me&quot; (216).  And though over the course of the novel, the main character expresses a fair amount of discontent with her body, she overcomes that discontent and rejects becoming a disembodied entity, regardless of the pain her body sometimes brings.&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I thought it was very cool that Hopkinson could push away technology not only using the typical presentation of a seemingly benevolent technology gone horribly, horribly wrong, but also through a very firm embrace of the natural, corporeal world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s with Antonio?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/290</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I take issue with Nalo Hopkinson&#039;s portrayal of love in Midnight robber.  In particular, I object to the way that the story of Antonio plays out.  I acknowledge that he was always a clearly flawed character, but I didn&#039;t see him as someone who was beyond saving in the beginning of the book.  In fact, I saw him as a uniquely empathetic character, in that he clearly loved his daughter.  He may have been a sinister mayor, with a desire to keep secrets from Nanny and the public, but in the beginning, it seems like he is not all selfishness.  When we first meet her, Antonio reveals his inner tenderness for Tan-Tan, &quot;his doux-doux darling girl, his one pureness.&quot; (13) He adores her so much that, &quot;he was forever going to watch at her sleeping in her bassinet.&quot; (13)  Clearly, there is something unique about Antonio&#039;s relationship with Tan-Tan.  The love he shows to Tan-Tan is possibly only paralleled by the love that Tan-Tan shows him in the beginning.  When I read this description of Antonio&#039;s adoration, I immediately categorized him as someone to root for.  My reasoning was as follows.  He loves Tan-Tan in what seems to be a purely selfless way, so he must care for more than just himself.  If he cares for one person more than himself, he must be capable of caring for others.  I had thought that his love for his daughter revealed that Antonio was a truly caring person.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially, when contrasted with Antonio&#039;s relationship with Ione, I thought Antonio&#039;s relationship with Tan-Tan would be a saving grace.  Before they had a baby together, Ione&#039;s and Antonio&#039;s lives were ruled by passion.  Their pursuit of &quot;love so sweet it hot&quot; led them to repeatedly cheat on each other. (45)  They apparently saw this dynamic, where they were constantly quarrelling over the each other&#039;s lovers, as a game, which somehow kept their sexual life interesting, and provide for passionate reunions.  To me, this sort of behavior seems completely hedonistic and self-serving.  Yet, once they have the Tan-Tan, Antonio seems to experience an almost tangible shift in priorities.  Ione continued with her series of other lovers, but the romantic turbulence doesn&#039;t seem like it was a prominent factor in their lives until we reach the where the story starts off.  I had thought this series of events indicated that the entrance of Tan-Tan into Antonio&#039;s life had redirected him away from an entirely selfish mode of functioning.  It seemed to me that Hopkinson portrayed passion as a destructive force, but that the entrance of Tan-Tan into the story stifled the cycle of passion by introducing love into the equation.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, all my notions about Antonio were steadily shattered.  It starts when it is revealed that he used poison in the machete battle.  From there, the situation deteriorates.  It becomes clear that Antonio is still the same self centered man, and Tan-Tan&#039;s attachment to him becomes painful.  He leaves her outside the bedroom while he and Ione fuck, right before he is sent to his holding cell. Clearly, his passion overwhelmed the love that we were seeing earlier in the book.  How could he want his last act as a citizen of Toissant to be to fuck his wife, rather than see his daughter?  It tore at me more than I would have expected.  From then on, desire, not love seems to be his driving motivation.  He took Tan-Tan with him half-way tree, seemingly out of desperation, rather than any care for her.  And ultimately, this desire goes completely out of control, and he rapes his daughter, expressing, what I once would have considered love, as pure primal passion.&lt;br /&gt;
To summarize, I see this chain of events as a way to befoul fatherly love.  I can&#039;t imagine how the feelings he felt for his daughter in the beginning could be conveyed as anything more sinister than any other father&#039;s feelings.  By the development, it seems to me that Nalo Hopkinson is saying that this love really is rooted in passion, and therefore that love is truly as destructive as passion.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>metaverse(s) and identity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/289</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this is me freaking out somewhat because I realized halfway through the weekend that I forgot to do my post about Snow Crash...eeeeek. Let&#039;s see what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one enters the Metaverse, an &quot;avatar&quot; or virtual clone of oneself is created and used for interaction. We all seemed to agree in class that there are points in the book in which it&#039;s hard to tell whether Hiro is in the &quot;real world&quot; or the Metaverse; this creates an interesting problem for the whole great American ideal of the secure individual self that no one else can touch. Obviously the Metaverse allows for some distinctive bending of the laws of the natural world; basic actions such as walking, running, talking with others can be executed purely through the power of the mind. One can almost be completely detached from one&#039;s &quot;self&quot; in the Metaverse and yet still be controlling them. Only fighting requires total immersion into one&#039;s virtual self. Where, then, do we draw the line between characteristics that cannot be changed (race, perhaps) and constructed aspects of the self? Or can any human characteristic be changed, i.e. mind over matter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s possible that this book is suggesting a world in which identity is completely a personal and social construct...and that we are either already in that world without realizing it, or moving towards that world. Hiro&#039;s multifaceted racial identity (part black, part Asian by way of...etc.) certainly suggests a purposeful breakdown of racism and a growing inability to pigeonhole anyone based on their appearance or skin color. We talked some in class about the virtual reality game Second Life (which I will admit to having an account on at one point, though I split once I realized actual money was involved) which is similar in theory to the Metaverse, and how its &quot;artificiality&quot; has been positive in some ways, creating an environment in which people of all colors and preferences are free to express themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in an indirect study of the Metaverse, I found myself thinking about something I actually noticed while I was still playing Second Life...often people of non-white races (black, Asian, Indian, etc.) would make their avatars visibly white and then brag about how &quot;white&quot; they were. They blurred the lines, by proudly declaring their actual ethnicity in their avatar&#039;s profile, even if the avatar itself was blonde, pale and very &quot;Aryan&quot; looking. This bothered me a bit. In an odd way, the ability to construct oneself was reinforcing racism and other problems of our society, such as homophobia and religious extremism; but why? Is it because we don&#039;t know how to operate any other way? Does commerce and capitalism require this kind of racial hierarchy? One of my favorite things about sci fi in general is how it pushes people to imagine their world differently and put down their assumptions...so I would hope that we&#039;re not stuck regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the main question of the Metaverse is whether we have the same amount of freedom or less freedom than Hiro when it comes to re-creating ourselves; in a virtual reality game we seem to have the same amount, but the problems that we struggle with in the real world end up being re-created. In the real world, it is not recommended to change one&#039;s skin color although it is possible; but, we are in the process of redefining race, and the population of multiracial/multicultural people is expanding. Could our identity be just as malleable in the real world as it is virtually?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Eshu</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/287</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about how Hopkinson&#039;s dialect critiques the normal technology-centric language of science fiction books, and the name &quot;Eshu&quot; came to mind. Looking it up on Wikipedia reveals some cool things (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&quot; title=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a mythological character from &quot;Yoruba mythology and related New World traditions&quot; who protects travelers -- definitely makes sense as a choice of terminology for a &#039;smart house&#039; that can help you out even when you&#039;re on the road. At the same time, Eshu was all about teaching people lessons, so maybe it makes sense that human nature (wanting to have privacy to do more-sneaky things) forces Antonio to try and get away from Eshu&#039;s all-knowing/all-seeing watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douen comes from Afro-Carribean mythology, too (Yoruba = west Africa), as part of Trinidadian mythology they were the forest-dwelling spirits of lost (unbaptized?) children (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caribbeantales.ca/ct_newsletter/archives/your_story/1/the_douen/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Atlantis - A Sun Ra Appreciation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/285</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was watching &quot;The Last Angel of History&quot; this evening, and I spent the first fifteen minutes wondering &quot;When are they gonna talk about Sun Ra? Why aren&#039;t they talking about Sun Ra? Who&#039;s George Clinton without Sun Ra?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, the film brought him up. Still, though, as far as the space motif in black musics goes, the movie definitely thinks that George Clinton is the ne plus ultra. At one point, Derrick May refers to Sun Ra as &quot;George Clinton&#039;s mentor.&quot; But then the topic gets dropped, and the film again assumes George Clinton to be the pinnacle of the phenomenon of SF in black musics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is simply to bring up the great work of Sun Ra once again. Space is the Place is probably the most famous album, if only because of the film tie-in (even if you haven&#039;t heard the album you may have seen the blaxploitation movie of same name). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me, Atlantis is actually his best album, and it&#039;s also the one that&#039;s most easily legible as the blend of blues, jazz, funk, and electronic music that the movie hints at at the beginning--the whole &quot;black technology&quot; bit with the Robert Johnson myth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the song &quot;Lemuria,&quot; for instance. It starts off with a single, off-tune keyboard note, followed by scattered-sounding snare tapping; not quite a count-in rhythm, even, but a sort of primordial presence, wherein you could imagine the seeds of such a rhythm developing. But before that happens, a stuttering electric funk guitar. The guitar proceeds on its own, tentatively, for a few seconds. You know how your computer stutters a little right when you bring it out of hibernation? This guitar sounds as if played by a robot just awakened from such a hibernation. You can&#039;t even really tell whether it&#039;s funk; it might be that the robot is trying to emulate Robert Johnson after all. Then there&#039;s a dot-dot-dash of a keyboard staccato popping up in between guitar notes. Then the snare comes back; then a wincing, farting saxophone appears. And suddenly there&#039;s a lurching, lumbering blues robot trying it&#039;s damnedest to dance a funk dance. And it sort of works, but the coolest part is how it doesn&#039;t quite all hang together, like a Thelonious Monk rhythm but with the the whole body, all the limbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s what I imagine a fully activated black music technology--such as the film posits--sounding like. If you don&#039;t know it, check it out. And remember that he was doing this at least ten years before Mothership Connection (and much longer, in fact; Atlantis was, of course, a mid-to-late album, coming as it did in 1967).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>cool stuff with turntables</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/283</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I was watching &quot;The Last Angel of History&quot; tonight, and at one point, turntables are mentioned, and earlier today, &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.kitundu.com/&quot;&gt;Walter Kitundu&lt;/a&gt; came to my digital art class, and told us about and showed pictured of a ton of different instruments he has made out of turn tables that are played like string instruments, or drums, or by various forces of nature.  For me, the concept of taking something so very far beyond its intended/expected/conceived of  use really resonated with aspects of the movie.  Also, cool sound art.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Metavirus?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/282</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book, because, in large part, everything had a perfect degree of ludicrousness.  Everything was so foreign, and so unexpected, yet, Neil Stephenson was able to make it believable, by basing the ideas in historic, scientific, sociological, or linguistic fact.  However, this consistency made the advent of the metavirus very strange to me.  He mentions briefly that the bitmap which is presented to the hackers and fries their brains was received from space.  Somehow rife picked it up on radiowaves, but I don&#039;t get how that is even remotely sensible.  Can anyone provide me with any info which sets that notion up in the book: previous passages, scientific theories, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Link of Interest: Snow Crash on TVTropes.org</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/281</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in class, this should be of interest to any fans of Snow Crash, or fiction in general...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&quot; title=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&quot;&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shown Their Work entry seems especially relevant, as now I know more about Sumerian mythology than I ever cared to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Juanita the goddess</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/280</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though somewhat of a periphery character, Juanita is arguably one of the most powerful characters in Stephenson&#039;s &quot;Snow Crash.&quot;  While most of the people who were working for Lagos are in the project for their physical power, like Ng&#039;s security and the Mafia&#039;s muscle, Juanita is in the project because of her mind, and she is the only one who looks at Lagos&#039; goals and makes her own larger, personal goals in the project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Juanita who first brings Hiro into the project.  She tells him he will be working somewhat under Lagos, but when Hiro meets Lagos at the concert, the man has no interest in Hiro.  This is perhaps the first indication that Juanita may be working at something more than solving the mystery.  By bringing in Hiro, who it seems is of a relatively comparable skill level with computers as Juanita, she frees herself up from her job as hacker to be able to pursue her own goals and work towards achieving her own power goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita and Hiro both use manipulation as a source of power and control.  Hiro, however, keeps this manipulation to a semi-concrete level by manipulating data and computers, but not people directly.  Juanita, on the other hand, is presented as always using her skills as a manipulator on people: she programs the faces in the Metaverse, controlling people&#039;s ability to have life-like interactions.  When she first asks Hiro to join her in the anti-Snow Crash project, she tells him , she tells him  that she will talk to him in the Metaverse, something she usually avoids, &quot;Because of our relationship--when I was writing this--you and I are the only two people who can ever have an honest conversation in the Metaverse&quot; (67).   Juanita&#039;s expressions are on the face of every single female avatar in the Metaverse, and Hiro&#039;s is on all the males.  This gives Juanita a certain god-like quality in the Metaverse, for man and woman are made in her and Hiro&#039;s image.  She can control subtle interactions in the Metaverse without even trying because she has programmed the faces, and because she only truly programmed two faces.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps her most disturbing exercise of power comes when she willingly goes to The Raft and becomes one of the people who is able to speak the ancient original tongue.  When they release the nam-shub of Enki, she refuses to be &quot;cured.&quot;  When Hiro asks why, she says, &quot;I&#039;m a neurolinguistic hacker now, Hiro.  I went through hell to obtain this knowledge.  It&#039;s part of me.  Don&#039;t expect me to submit to a lobotomy&quot; (432).    Yet presumably there are others on the raft who had a similar ability, and she had no qualms about &quot;lobotomizing&quot; them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita&#039;s close personal association with Inanna is a way for her to manifest the superiority she feels to those around her.  By identifying herself as a goddess, Juanita can rationalize doing to others what she will not do to herself.  The fact that she does retain the ability to hack the brainstem is perhaps the most frightening thing about her.  What exactly does she plan to *do* with this ability?  Rife tried to conquer the world with his knowledge of the me and his ability to &quot;hack the brainstem.&quot;  Given Juanita&#039;s past record, it is hard to believe that fundamentally she will do anything all that different from Rife.  Perhaps not on the scale, perhaps far more subtly, but when one can hack the brainstem, when one has god-like power over others, is there truly any way to avoid turning those &quot;inferior&quot; to you into dependent slaves of one sort or another?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Black-and-White Persons</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class we talked about a couple different ways that Snow Crash analogizes issues of race: &quot;thrashers&quot; constitute an ethnic identity; hackers, too, have unique social identities as well as somewhat unique physiologies. In this response, I guess I just want to add another example, but it&#039;s one that I find particularly interesting: the figure of the &quot;black-and-white person&quot; within the Metaverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the &quot;black-and-white person&quot; is not immediately visible as at least analogously related to a racial identity, I guess I&#039;ll suggest a couple ways in which the book presents him/her/it in that way. First is the issue of context. Snow Crash has an almost Faulknerian interest in multiraciality; not since Joe Christmas has a fictional character&#039;s polyglot identity caused so much trouble--e.g., when YT is fleeing from the &quot;jeeks&quot; at The Clink, she considers briefly pulling into a New South Africa franchulate, but then decides against it: &quot;Scratch that; Hiro is black, or at least part black. Can&#039;t take him into New South Africa&quot; (83). I guess the point that I would make is that racial identities are important to the book--it&#039;s important that YT is white (not just as &quot;whitey,&quot; but also as a fifteen-year-old white female who, we&#039;re told repeatedly, is in constant danger of being raped because of that fact; who hangs limp and Fay Wray-ish in Raven&#039;s arms as he carries her onto the Raft); it&#039;s important that Raven&#039;s American Indian, and, what&#039;s more, part of this significance is that Hiro can&#039;t figure out what racial identity to give Raven--it&#039;s the fate of the Aleut in this book to be the ignored or misrecognized identity. Someone who--like Hiro--represents &quot;and&quot; rather than &quot;either/or&quot; is bound to throw a wrench in the book&#039;s classification system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, lo and behold, that is pretty much how things turn out for the &quot;black-and-white person&quot; in the Metaverse. Here I guess I should say that, obviously, anyone can be a black-and-white person; the black-and-white person is treated as an identity that inheres only in the Metaverse; at various times, many different characters of many different real-world racial identities become black-and-white people. Someone may appear in the Metaverse as a black-and-white person one day, and then as someone altogether different the next. So there are a lot of ways in which being black-and-white in the Metaverse isn&#039;t like being black or white in the real world. But there is a sense in which the black-and-white identity takes over for real world racial identities; you can&#039;t be both black and black-and-white; therefore, having a black-and-white identity in the Metaverse works as a substitute for the social work that&#039;s done when one has a white identity in the real world. Right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some examples. The &quot;black-and-white person&quot; in the Metaverse is a universally spat-upon identity. This is unique in the universe of Snow Crash. New South Africans hate blacks, Asians, and Jews. Italians don&#039;t really seem to like Asians all that much. American Indians--if Raven is a representative sample, which he surely isn&#039;t--hate pretty much everyone. But point being: there really doesn&#039;t seem to be a group that&#039;s loathed by every other group. Except the black-and-white person in the context of the Metaverse. &quot; &#039;Da5id,&#039; Hiro says, &#039;I can&#039;t believe you took a hypercard from a black-and-white person&#039;&quot; (72); &quot;Going into The Black Sun would not be practical--it would look and sound terrible, and the other patrons would look at him as if he were some kind of black-and-white person&quot; (106); &quot;She knows that the people in the Street are giving her dirty looks because she&#039;s just coming in from a shitty public terminal. She&#039;s a trashy black-and-white person&quot; (220). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are clearly historical analogies for all these examples, all of which have to do with racial hatred. In some of the examples of how black-and-white persons are disliked, one could imagine substituting either &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot;--like, hypothetically, someone could possibly say, &quot;She&#039;s a trashy white person.&quot; But basically these examples refer to racial hatred directed at black people in American history. Like, the fact that Hiro&#039;s not welcome in the bar because he&#039;s a black-and-white person sounds like the sort of segregation and intolerance that led to sit-ins in the 1950s. Anyway, that&#039;s sort of beside the point, and it&#039;s awkward to point these things out because, in a way, the book is sort of playfully flippant about the topic--the phrase &quot;black-and-white person&quot; itself is sort of a joke, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we go back to the last example I gave, we&#039;re directed to most interesting account of what race looks like in the universe of Snow Crash. Again, I&#039;m not suggesting that the black-and-white person is a racial identity, but rather that it functions similarly, just as thrashers and hackers function as identities that are in certain ways analogous to race. But in the last example, YT reminds us that the reason black-and-white persons are disliked is because, other folks in the Metaverse assume, they&#039;re too poor to afford their own computer or are otherwise technologically disadvantaged--&quot;she&#039;s just coming in from a shitty public terminal.&quot; This account literalizes the socio-economic assumptions that--Snow Crash avers--subtend racial judgments. There&#039;s the clichÃ© (it is a clichÃ©, but one that&#039;s almost certainly sometimes accurate) that when white cops see a black man driving a nice car, they assume it&#039;s stolen; meaning they assume that black people in general can&#039;t afford nice cars. In the Metaverse, the very fact that one appears as a black-and-white person means that one has somehow been reduced to the humiliating situation of having to use a &quot;shitty public terminal.&quot; Again, this is imperfect; YT isn&#039;t really poor--although, it is true that, in a technocratic society, she wouldn&#039;t rank very high; she&#039;s only OK at guiding her avatar in the Metaverse and is constantly making fun of Hiro for the amount of time he spends logged on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess what&#039;s interesting to me is that Snow Crash seems to make the case that total privatization will mete out racial hatreds when profitable and stamp them out when not, such that they eventually become a non-issue--or an issue, as I suggested above, that no one group especially suffers from (although Raven might take issue with this statement). But even in such a universe, the less-privatized VR space of the Metaverse reproduces absolute hatreds, where there is one group that is just so generally loathed as to not want to show his/her black-and-white self in public.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Labyrinth of Existenz</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/278</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than talk about the many, many sexual metaphors and images that pop up in Existenz, I&#039;d like to talk about the film in terms of narrative, and its particular brand of alternate reality. This movie was certainly not helped by being released around the same time of the Matrix, since they cover somewhat similar ground, but Existenz is a quiet, low-budget, semi-incoherent techno-horror movie, and the Matrix is the Matrix. But, as alternate realities go, I think Existenz brings up a point that no other book or movie has yet about alternate reality: what if you can&#039;t tell which reality you&#039;re in? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, the Matrix sort of brought up this idea, but it was made pretty clear once people started dodging bullets which was reality and which was manipulable simulation. In fact, Neuromancer and Snow Crash also carry this idea that the mark of the &quot;real world&quot; is a certain powerlessness to natural laws (e.g. gravity); Case diving through 3-dimensional space and Hiro writing code to define the Black Sun are how we know they are in virtual reality. So we come to Existenz, where entering virtual reality give you no superpowers, or really any major distinction between where you were pre- and post-bioport plugging (aside from a narrative shift, which I&#039;ll get to). In fact, (spoilers alert), it&#039;s not even made clear which, if any, parts of the movie take place in reality, so the audience isn&#039;t even given a stable starting point to try and trace the journey between the virtual and the real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cronenberg does seem to offer a brief glimmer of hope, though, in that the narrative of the film seems to devolve as the characters go &quot;deeper&quot; into the game. The story began with a fairly standard plotline--a failed assassination on Character A, who goes on the run with Character B, who doesn&#039;t want to get dragged into all of this.  Willem Defoe&#039;s character is the first indication that this narrative may not be &quot;naturally occurring&quot; in the real world, but is a construction, since the coincidence that Allegra and Pikul would run into a gas station owner who has exactly what they need to advance the story line is a little too remarkable. As the story continues, they enter a game within a game, objects and characters pop up in the wrong &quot;narrative level&quot; (e.g. the tooth gun that was used to shoot Allegra in the first scene pops up again when they are supposedly in the game&#039;s Chinese Restaurant). The film ends with a &quot;realist revolution&quot;, multiple character deaths, and no real explanation of what&#039;s going on. By constructing his film this way, Cronenberg has done with narrative what Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and the Matrix did with surpassing the laws of reality: demonstrated the split between real and virtual. But, the closing scene offers a comprehensive and total &quot;gotcha!&quot; to the audience who think they have finally figured out where the line is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it seems like the &quot;It was all a dream&quot; cop-out, with everyone waking up from their Transcendenz headsets, sans spine-sphincters, laughing about how ridiculous that whole story about Existenz was. But, the closing line of the movie, and a couple of visual cues demonstrate that the game may be able to simulate nice, quiet reality just as effectively as the chaotic, excessive mess we&#039;ve seen for the past hour and a half. Regardless of whether or not you think they&#039;re still in the game at the end of the movie, you still have to force yourself to believe one or the other, because both seem equally plausible. This is ultimately where Cronenberg uses virtual reality to properly pull out the rug, because we finally understand that the distinction between real and virtual will be truly invalid if the real can be perfectly simulated. The notion of &quot;nested realities&quot; becomes terrifying if they are indistinguishable, because there is no way of knowing which is genuine. Even if we think we&#039;ve hit &quot;File&amp;gt;Quit&quot;, or unplugged, or taken off the high-def goggles, there&#039;s no assurance that that too is not just another simulation. Or, to take another tack, if they&#039;re indistinguishable, does it matter if we&#039;re in the real world or not?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&quot;Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/277</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve noticed that most of the other posts are about information, or artificial reality, or something like that, but I&#039;ve decided to post on something that&#039;s a little closer to the range of my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the novel, YT is the object of desire by nearly every single man around her. As one example, the one-eyed man calls her &quot;a hell of a chick. You&#039;re a knockout&quot; (171). Everyone is constantly looking at her, so much so that she feels its loss on the Raft, where everyone except Raven is entirely sexless. The novel seems to portray this overt sexuality as nothing more than a fact of life. If anything, it&#039;s a joke, even though the girl in question is not more than 15 years old. She is constantly mentioning sex with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Roadkill (73,162), and expects Hiro to pursue a relationship with her when she first proposes a partnership - &quot;this is going to end with him trying to get her into bed&quot; (87).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, sex in this novel is portrayed in a relatively positive light. Though blatant sexual desire is mostly associated with unpleasant people (the jail operator in the Clink, the security guards at the Mafia compound, the people in the truck stop, etc.) their desire is essentially harmless, and in fact provides a convenient tool by which they can be exploited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one unpleasant person that I have yet to mention, and the only person that inspires serious sexual desire in another character - Raven, who makes YT &quot;uncomfortably horny&quot; (343). Despite the fact that he basically kidnaps her from her job on the food line, she repeatedly speaks of going on a &quot;date&quot; with him (323, for example), and even in one instance describes him as her &quot;boyfriend&quot; (343). Being attracted to him, and knowing that he is attracted to her, has produced some desire for her to continue their relationship, even though she knows of Raven&#039;s reputation, and has seen some of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the mechanisms of commitment in Snow Crash are relatively simple. When two characters have a mutual sexual desire, this inspires the further desire to be committed to that person. This desire overwhelms any conflicting information that either party might receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you might expect, I think that the desire for commitment is actually quite strong between Raven and YT, as demonstrated by their final interaction. Raven is in a helicopter, flying over as the Kouriers swarm L. Bob Rife, but he&#039;s &quot;not watching any of these things. He&#039;s looking out the window at Y.T.... He grins at her and gives her the thumbs up. Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird&quot; (424). I really think that at this point, Raven admires her. She does not seriously threaten him, and yet she bested him in a sexual contest. In their final interaction, I see a reluctance for Raven to leave Y.T., and a similar reluctance for her to let him go. Why else would Raven focus his attention solely on her? Why else would Y.T. bite her lip as she flips him off? In the vein of the novel, they have been sexually involved, with mutual desire, and that inspires them to continue their association. I should note that YT is far more commited to Raven (desires him, wants to be with him) than she ever really is with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Roadkill. She has not had a satisfying sexual relationship with Roadkill, and so she&#039;s not nearly so invested in their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that Snow Crash provides the &quot;teenage boy&quot; perspective on sexual attraction as it relates to commitment. It is not nearly so nuanced as many of the other novels that we&#039;ve read, but I thought it was interesting that there was so clearly a relationship between sexual satisfaction and commitment. It anchors the spectrum at one end, I think, while The Handmaid&#039;s Tale anchors the spectrum at the other end, where sexuality acts constantly to break up commitments, or to prevent nascent commitments from being realized in a healthy manner.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Snow Crash vs Jennifer Government</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/276</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Both Snow Crash and Jennifer Government postulate a fairly dystopian future.  Snow Crash is very much science fiction, while Jennifer Government is merely fiction, and has nothing really scientific about it.  However, both overlap in their portrayals of business, corporations and government in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
In Snow Crash, large franchises have all the power.  These units are like nation-states, corporations, and gangs all in one.  For instance, there is the Mafia, which alongside its goons and guns for hire, run a large and successful pizza business.  There is the Hong Kong franchise, New South Africa, and among others, the Government franchise.  The government has turned into a for-profit business like the rest of these entities.  All of these entities can battle it out with the minimum of interference by any other organization, because the government doesn&#039;t work the same way as it used to.  Security must be handled by private firms, and all roads and mail are covered by private firms.  It is a darker place if one wants some government supports in their lives.  Jennifer Government postulates the same sort of future, with a few twists that&#039;s make it interesting to the Snow Crash future.  Jennifer Government is set in a world where corporations run everything.  The government has been nearly disbanded, and has only one job now.  The government tracks down criminals and catches them.  The catch is that the victim must pay the government to actually perform this service, because after taxes were abolished, the government needed some form of revenue.  The rest of the world, except for socialist Europe, is under the sway of anarcho-capitalism, which sounds very similar to the economic model in Snow Crash.  Roads are built by private companies, and are all toll roads.  That fact is hinted at in Snow Crash but never said right out.  Companies ally themselves together, and hire private security to keep their Corporations secure.  On one side the corporations hire The Police, a private security company descended from the real police.  This company has the power to throw people in jail that it was hired to arrest, just like in Snow Crash when Y.T. is caught in the burbclave.  On the other side is the NRA, which has evolved from its status to become a paramilitary organization that trains commandos for secret missions for its clients.  It has evolved into a company, just like The Mafia does in Snow Crash.&lt;br /&gt;
Jennifer Government&#039;s premise is a dreary one.  Jennifer Government takes the anarcho-capitalism that is in Snow Crash and drives it to the next level.  War in the world of Jennifer Government means business.  And the firms that are hired have surface to air missiles, tanks and other modern tech.  And they fight huge clashes between corporations.  No one says anything because it isn&#039;t any of their business.  In Snow Crash, the world has not quite progressed to that.  The maneuvers between corporations tend to be lighter.  They are still afraid to come out into the very open.  This would have changed with Rife&#039;s victory, but luckily (for some people) that crisis was averted.  But it is oh so easy to tell how much worse it could be for people if the world in Jennifer Government was the more similar to the world in Snow Crash.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anarchy in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/275</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The political world in Snow Crash resembles that of an organized anarchy.  We only get a real sense of what the governmental situation in America is like, but we know that the federal government completely collapsed.  The American dollar experienced hyper inflation similar to that of Germany in the early 1920&#039;s, to the point of where trillion dollar bills were almost worthless.  The role of the federal government has been reduced to the equivalent of an overly proud company that thinks it is way more important than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political system that arises resembles organized anarchy, for there is no true law, no inalienable rights, no justice system to protect a newborn child.  However there are rules and protection services offered through the individual franchulates.  This system of franchises combines with the free anarchy left with the disappearance to form a very capitalism rooted form of anarchy.  The different franchulates actually compete and advertise, whether in the real world or the metaverse, for citizens to come join.  Different franchulates carve out specific niches for their customers, such as the New South Africa franchise which offers genetic purity for the stereotypical southern white male.  Company wars manifest themselves in actual gang wars, such as the war depicted between the mafia owned Nova Sicilia and Narcolombia franchises.  This system, just like economic capitalism, leads to large powerful franchises such as Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong, and much smaller specialized franchises such and CosaNostra Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting parallel to the Anarchy system in the continental United States is found on the raft.  One quote in particular shows this on page 387: &quot;The worst thing that can happen on the Raft is for your neighborhood to get cut loose.  That&#039;s why the raft is such a tangled mess.  Each neighborhood is afraid that the neighboring &#039;hoods are going to gang up on them, cut them loose, leave them to starve in the middle of the Pacific.  So they are constantly finding new ways to tie themselves into each other...&quot;  the raft mirrors anarchy in that there again is no law or inherent rights obtained just by being a part of the raft.  It is a cutthroat, free-for-all society in which any member could get screwed over and not be able to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Parallel &quot;realities&quot; make for some interesting experiences...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/274</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Snow Crash takes a very interesting approach to the future...namely, an evolution of what we&#039;d consider the internet.  However, this web of information is more than just a bunch of pages to look at...its a whole new reality whatsoever, with people interacting, sharing, and doing stuff almost as if it is the real world....with some modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the setup of the Street and The Black Sun bar that Hiro frequents.  The Street itself is basically a hub...information and people gather in great amounts there, and they filter off/leave for sub-streets for various reasons.  The metaphor here of streets implies a distinct parallel to the real world...in fact, could even be called a reality of its own with city streets, and a central &quot;main&quot; street where lots of people gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black Sun is a sorta-typical bar, with the difference being that some of the best hackers in the world hang out there, along with several other important figures.  In a way, it is a parallel to some sort of exclusive night club or bar, and that fact that such a things exists (and has drinks of its own) shows the extent by which this alternate universe has developed.  If you think about it, why would there be a need for drinking where information is exchanged and presented? (and drugs for that matter, like Snow Crash itself).  Our current internet does that decently enough as is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its the differences from reality that kinda make me realize why such unnecessary things exist.  The fact that Hiro wrote the algorithms for sword-fighting....and even DEATH by such combat...shows the level of control hackers like Hiro have over the &quot;reality&quot; of the Metaverse.  In essence, the Metaverse serves as a new world of its own...tailored to the needs and wants of its people to a larger degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me a bit towards some of our discussion in class, primarily Second Life.  This program was brought up because it draws its inspiration from the novel and tries to mimic such an environment.  Out of curiosity, I decided to try a free account just to see what it was about and how close it came/comes to realizing the picture Snow Crash portrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of exploration and messing around, I found it to be quite an experience.  The similarities and parallels to the Metaverse in Snow Crash are quite astounding, and the possibilities look endless.  Perhaps our future might end up this way, as the technology is already there to a degree (and developing).  Granted, something like Second Life would take ages to get to that point....but I&#039;m somewhat thrilled by the thought that it might happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Stephenson Bias</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/273</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On page 57 of Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson describes the problem that the Black Sun staff has understanding Juanita&#039;s work as &quot;sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.&quot;  To some degree, it seems that he may be, intentionally or not, describing himself.&lt;br /&gt;
	For a male author whose work contains so many female protagonists, Stephenson tends to write them into surprisingly familiar paradigms.  While it&#039;s relatively subtle, his heroines tend to function as sex objects, and operate around the men among them.   Juanita, for instance, despite being the most broadly functional holder of the information in the Babel/Infocalypse stack, abdicates a large portion of the responsibility involved in order to do relatively academic research.  The &#039;real work&#039; of unraveling L. Bob Rife&#039;s evil master plan is left to the men: Mr. Lee, Uncle Enzo, Ng, and Hiro, who, most of the time seems to be involved primarily to the end of getting back together with Juanita.  Even Y.T. describes her as &quot;that piece of tailâ€¦&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Y.T., while pretty much as empowered as anyone can get, is rather disenfranchised, for the simple reason of being 15, and possessing the maturity level of a 15 year old.  She&#039;s mostly just playing with the power she has as a middle class white girl in America, until she&#039;s kidnapped and brought to the Raft.  When she ends up in an unfamiliar place, living as she realizes much of the world lives, she gets scared and stays in her place.  She too ends up needing a man to come rescue her, and once again, Raven ends up helping her cause trouble purely because he&#039;s enamored of her physical charms.&lt;br /&gt;
The frustrating thing about Stephenson is that he&#039;s clearly trying.  Most of his work, and all of his recent work, is built around strong, driven female characters.  However, their power is consistently derived in a fairly traditional form.  Eliza, of the Baroque cycle, possesses astounding business acumen, but is still far more successful at acquiring power through sex, marriage and subtle politicking.  Princess Nell of The Diamond Age takes her astounding skill set and works as a writer for a bordello.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, this may be a critique of Stephenson&#039;s reader base.  His fans consist, in great part of the very same type of well-intentioned male techies he&#039;s describing, each thinking, as they read the sentence, that he&#039;s talking about someone else.  Perhaps the forms of power with which Stephenson endows his female characters are those he thinks will go down most smoothly, and  make the most impression in the end.  Or maybe it&#039;s just disturbing that a smart, thoughtful, modern male science fiction writer still can&#039;t give the women in his novels power unmediated by men.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>2 effects of capitalism gone wild</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/272</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to follow-up on the idea presented in-class that Snow Crash takes a similar stance on both prejudice and democratic government. Eventually both will be pushed out of existence as capitalist competitivism acts as the ultimate driving force for all socio-cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the messages about prejudice found in the novel. Japanese (to use Snow Crash&#039;s terminology, &quot;Nipponese&quot; from here on out) businessmen rule economically, despite whatever prejudice may have existed in the past. The New South Africans have their own franchise with every right to create whatever racist rules they want (82), but they only exist because they had some economic value (and they prove quite easy to dispatch â€“ see pp. 301-302). As they cease to remain competitive, they will crumble in this world of no external support. Moreover, with more and more of life taking place in the metaverse, the idea of identity changes rapidly. In the &#039;verse, &quot;your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limits of your equipment&quot; (36). Race and gender become preferences that one can hide from an outside world. With an altered physics, overcrowding no longer becomes a physical problem â€“ there is no physical urban space to fight over as everyone can occupy any space and only the most advanced have created a means of physical combat. Combined with an inability to produce results within this ultra-capitalist world, prejudice becomes obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow Crash makes similar predictions about the future of the US democratic government. From the introduction of YT&#039;s mother it becomes clear that the government no longer functions in any way truly meaningful to the people it used to serve. With the CIA and Library of Congress corporatized, the government begins to sound just like another franchise: &quot;Feds don&#039;t make much money, but they have to work hard, to show their loyalty&quot; (101). With weekly polygraph tests and no obvious influence on the rest of the country (security is privatized and services, to the extent that they exist at all, are provided by each burbclave), the feds seemed to have turned on themselves to keep busy. The steadily increasing power big business stripped the government of any legitimate function. In this capitalist world, they quickly disappear into the fringes of society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the red pill or blue pill?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/271</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, judging by the titles of the responses that have come before me, I have chosen a well-trodden path to talk about, but it&#039;s the only question that came up repeatedly for me as I was reading, so I&#039;m going to write about it anyway and hope that some kind of original thought manages to creep its way in somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a popular theme for science fiction writing and film: which to choose, grim reality or blissful illusion?  Somehow, the message is nearly always &quot;choose reality&quot; â€“ Snow Crash is the first text I&#039;ve come across (though I do not claim to have a comprehensive view) that is somewhat value-neutral on the subject.  I say &quot;somewhat&quot; because the two main characters advance such polar opposite viewpoints, both of which seem equally appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro is in control and has power in the Metaverse; he is a &quot;warrior prince&quot; in the Metaverse (63).  He is not totally sold on reality, either, saying &quot;when you live in a shithole, there&#039;s always the Metaverse&quot; (63).  Y.T. has a similar kind of control and power in reality; she is pretty much autonomous and is almost always in control of her body and her fate.  She has no qualms about entering into the Metaverse only as a black-and-white, something aficionados of the Metaverse cringe at, and criticizes Hiro at one point (though I cannot find the citation now, of course) for spending too much time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, a friend of mine posed this question to me: If you could have a spouse OR a Hobbes (of the Calvin and Hobbes variety), which would you choose?  It was supposed to be a light question to keep the conversation going, but the ensuing discussion went on for hours.  The advantages and disadvantages of having a spouse are pretty obvious, so I will pass over them for now.  Hobbes would be the perfect best friend â€“ you would have a complete and total understanding of one another, and you would be guaranteed to never meet anyone that could even rival Hobbes for fulfilling interaction and conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for everyone else, he&#039;s imaginary.  You cannot share him with anyone else, so you effectively have to choose between a perfect friendship with one person, and the rest of the world, which does not contain anyone who could be your friend in any real way (they will always pale in comparison to Hobbes).  Compare this to Hiro: does he choose the U-Stor-It or the Metaverse, a reality that he can manipulate and control, a reality more perfect than one he could realistically attain in the real Los Angeles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s answer is ambiguous, which is a bit of a cop-out, but does prove what a complex question it is.  Snow Crash seems not to be arguing for one kind of reality over another, but a balance of the two.  Hiro criticizes those who never totally leave the Metaverse, describing the gargoyles as &quot;the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporationâ€¦they serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them.  Nothing looks stupiderâ€¦[it] mark[s] the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society (123-124).  However â€“ lest readers think they have landed on a solution to the tension â€“ Hiro becomes a gargoyle later in the book, and that unquestionably saves his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Associations</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/270</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Power plays a very significant role in Snow Crash.  With the fall of government, life has become radically unstable, with radically different expectations in terms of justice.  Individual security no longer holds the significance that we are used to.  The only way for an individual to ensure that violations of personal interests won&#039;t go unpunished is to tie those interests with the interests of a group, which means, in effect, to become a part of a franchise.  This truth is expressed repeatedly in the book by both Y.T. and Hiro and the way they manage their individualism.  The book first hints at this fact when discussing Hiro&#039;s employment choices.  Hiro prefers to remain a freelance hacker, but  apparently &quot;now, that&#039;s no longer possible, [because] software comes out of factories, and hackers are [] assembly-line workers.&quot; (39)  While the primary purpose of this passage is to describe the majority of the hacking profession, it clearly implies that there is no place for individual work, because organizations out-compete individual hackers.  However, Y.T. provides the best example of how association with a group is a form of protection.  When she&#039;s kidnapped, her connection to the RadiKS company allows her to escape.  Her membership in that group grants her the protection of that group, and ultimately, she&#039;s able to rouse a minor trasher army to take down the helicopter that she&#039;s in.  This sort of street justice only protects those that are associated, and it seems that the more powerful your associates are, the better your protection will be.  However, this protection has limits.  When Y.T. is apprehended by Metacops after delivering Hiro&#039;s pizza, she reminds them that &quot;I work for RadiKS.  We protect our own,&quot; but the cops respond &quot;Not tonight you don&#039;t.  Tonight you took a pizza from a scene of a car wreck.  Left the scene of an accident.  RadiKS tell you to deliver that pizza?&quot; (52)  She doesn&#039;t dispute this, because she realizes that RadiKS won&#039;t protect her if she strays outside their &#039;jurisdiction&#039;.  This reveals that, while the associations which people attach themselves to do provide some safety for the individual, but individual justice is nonexistent, since these franchulates/companies/sovereign nations are really only concerned with the integrity of the group as a whole.  Ultimately, this dynamic shows that the individual is only granted power through connections to other people, and adherence to the norms those people have agreed upon.  At least, this is what the system seems to be in the beginning of the book.&lt;br /&gt;
	As the book progresses, the power of the individual becomes more and more pronounced.  Raven seems like one of the primary catalysts for this change in perspective.  Raven, as an Aleut, is already predisposed to reject any association with any group.  His family and tribe history isolates him from anyone else, because his tribe had been isolated and disregarded by the rest of the world, to the extent that their own government tested nuclear weapons on them.  The resulting compulsion to vendetta, and quest to nuke America bars him from integrating into this culture.  However, Raven does more than resist integration.  From the first time Raven appears, it seems like he transcends the standard.  Hiro notices Raven in the crowd outside the Black Sun initially, because he stands much taller than everyone else.  Though, Raven manages to stand out in more ways than just his height.  When he makes his appearance at the concert, he transcends local gang politics, all on his own.  While it is arguable that the rules don&#039;t apply to him, simply because he&#039;s the most dangerous mother with a glass knife, and he&#039;s got an H-Bomb rigged to his brain, it seems to me that his power comes from something less tangible.  His ability to ride the waves seems like his real source of power.  This applies physically to his ability to use waves to travel long distances in kayak, but it also applies more generally to see the forces that are naturally present, and hitch a ride, as he did with the Orthos.  This sort of ability to ride these waves shows that he is able to manipulate existent forces to make groups work for him, instead of him working for a group.  I think his introduction into the story opens up new modes of functioning, which Hiro and Y.T. explore.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ghost in the shell</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/269</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my roommate about our scifi class and this obsession with information (like those tapes from Cyteen) and the Metaverse from Snow Crash, and she brought up this anime movie called &quot;Ghost in the Shell.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a clip from youtube.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=txXeLt1ECwI&amp;amp;feature=related&quot; title=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=txXeLt1ECwI&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;http://youtube.com/watch?v=txXeLt1ECwI&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever seen this?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>thoughts on reality video games, the metaverse...y mas</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/268</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reality tv shows have become more popularized these last few years.  Despite the fact that they&#039;re not intellectually stimulating, don&#039;t have a plot, and are probably not even completely &quot;reality,&quot; people love them!  Reading about the Metaverse made me think about Second Life, which interestingly enough, was modeled after the Metaverse in Snow Crash.  Just like reality shows seem to dominate television these days, games like the Sims entertain by trying to recreate ordinary everyday activities.  I personally don&#039;t understand how this can be interesting; what is the goal of this &quot;game&quot;?  It doesn&#039;t have an end goal, unlike traditional video games.  There is no competition because there are no winners or losers.  If there&#039;s no competition and no purpose, where is the thrill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in Snow Crash, when Hiro still has his job as &quot;The Deliverator,&quot; he claims to like that job because of the life-or-death, &quot;life on the line,&quot; fight or flight adrenaline it induces.  &quot;It&#039;s like being a kamikaze pilot.  Your mind is clear&quot; (5).  Unlike that monotonous cubicle job that he could have as a programmer working for a large corporation, it&#039;s exciting because there is a goal.  Make that delivery in 30 minutes or under, or you&#039;re toast.  Quite literally.  (Isn&#039;t it hilarious that the Mafia is in the pizza delivering industry?  How fitting...) He&#039;s trying to set a PR every time someone orders a pizza.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Life in America&quot; is steeped in meaningless jobs.  Hiro observes that &quot;people just rely on plain old competition...CosaNostra Pizza doesn&#039;t have any competition.  Competition goes against the Mafia ethic&quot; (5).  This corporate version of competition is denigrated.  Interoffice, intraoffice politics, and such rely on competition to generate more success, much in the same vein as the technological advancements that came out of the Cold War: who can do it better?  It&#039;s a &quot;rat race&quot; (5).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro thinks that competition eliminates self-motivation.  &quot;Life in America&quot; has strayed far from the Protestant work ethic that helped capitalism evolve.  There is no innate desire to work hard for moral or familial obligations.  That&#039;s why Hiro likes a job that forces him to operate to the best of his abilities.  &quot;You don&#039;t work harder because you&#039;re competing against some identical operation down the street.  You work harder because everything is on the line. Your name, your honor, your family, your life&quot; (5).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So I wrote about race.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/267</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Race and racial discrimination are a very large part of Neal Stephenson&#039;s Snow Crash, but they do not manifest in the way we would expect.  In Stephenson&#039;s future world, race becomes defined more by who you work for rather than what your genetics are.  Residents and employees of the various Franchises are granted a sense of exclusive community as per their &quot;citizenship,&quot; and come to distrust and even feud with those from other Franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is genetically half African, half Japanese, and the people he deals with on a regular basis are just as culturally diverse.  Hiro&#039;s very roommate, Vitaly Chernobyl, comes from a very different background:  &quot;Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex-Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev,&quot; (104).  Japanese and Russians have never been on very friendly terms, and I have no idea of the contact levels between Russians and Africans, but I don&#039;t imagine they are long time allies.  Yet the two can get along perfectly fine.  Similarly, Italians and Hiro, Chinese and Japanese, and other individual interracial relationships occur without problem.  This is because racial divisions have moved from original ethnicity to gained citizenship within franchulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most predominant franchise in the novel is The Mafia, an organization unchanged from reality to novel in its power structure.  The Mafia is a very welcoming organization to the individual, evidenced by their advertisements, which portray the head of the franchise, Uncle Enzo, with &quot;his arm around the shoulders of a young wholesome-looking black kid,&quot; or another that says: &quot;NO WAY, JOSÃ‰! Uncle Enzo holding up one hand to stop an Uzi-toting Hispanic scumbag; behind him stands a pan-ethnic phalanx of kids and grannies, resolutely gripping baseball bats and frying pans,&quot; (146).  But when it comes to inter-franchulate relations, the Mafia, like most other franchulates, is not particularly fond of the opposition.  &quot;Most of the franchises are yellow-logoed, wrong-side-of-the-tracks operations like Uptown, Narcolobia, Caymans Plus, Metazania, and The Clink.  But standing out like rocky islands in this swamp are the Nova Sicilia franchulates â€“ beachheads for the Mafia&#039;s effort to outduel the overwhelmingly strong Narcolobia,&quot; (145).  Sure, they could be called rival companies, but their power and operations extend way beyond that of what one would consider corporate.  Franchises even have passports, making them even more like a country than a business:  &quot;They don&#039;t want to let him in.  He flashes his passport; the doors openâ€¦ Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong is an open country, always looking for new citizens, even if they are the poorest Refus,&quot; (328).  Alliances are even formed between them, as the Mafia and Mr. Lee&#039;s people get together in an attempt to overthrow another superpower, L. Bob Rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation of Ethnicity from a biologically determined factor to an issue of allegiances and subscription is an interesting proposition by Stephenson.  People are learning to classify less along genetic lineage and be less racist I feel, but the idea that something will arise to replace this is a frightening idea.  Stephenson seems to be hinting at ingrained structures of hate and rivalry, which are hard to deny, especially when examining our past as a species, but to say that our future just holds more of the same is a rather pessimistic view, and one I hope does not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Could talk some more about race, but...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/266</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is defined from the second page as someone who kicks ass: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment of his and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren&#039;t afraid of the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords require no demonstrations&quot; (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some satiric bite to Stephenson&#039;s picture of America as a cross between a streetfight and an NRA convention, but there is rather more to the violence than necessary that particular aim. Which is not to say that Stephenson worries to much about wearing his jokes out, or even advancing the plot smoothly. But there is another motive behind all this--it&#039;s central to Hiro&#039;s development as a character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street cimre. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.  Hiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken&quot; (271)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not plot that drives the violence of the book. It is not satire, either. It isn&#039;t even the congenital obsession of science fiction--the invention of new and amusing ways for characters to fold, spindle and mutilate each other. It is the way Hiro grows. We know he likes swords, we know that he no longer wants to be the world&#039;s baddest motherfucker, and we know that he can administer the coup de grace when he must.  Big parts of Hiro&#039;s personality, as Stephenson presents it, are caught up in the way he fights, and how he feels about that fighting. This seems, somehow, caught up in the way that he constructs gender--when he says all men under twenty-five, he means all men. If it were only Hiro, perhaps this could be overlooked. But it&#039;s not only Hiro, though. All three of the main male characters in SC are killers--Hiro, Raven and Uncle Enzo.  YT, a fifteen-year old girl, also fights when she has to, but it&#039;s non-lethal. She has a sonic skateboard that breaks glass, and pepper spray, and bracelets that give people shocks, but she doesn&#039;t use swords, or guns, or nuclear weapons. But it&#039;s Hiro&#039;s ex-girlfriend, the linguistic hacker Juanita, who shows the difference between men and women in Stephenson most explicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;First things first,&quot; Juanita says. &quot;The control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Okay, you get ready to grab the tablet, and I&#039;ll take out the control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;How are you going to do that? By cutting people up with swords?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yeah. That&#039;s the only thing they&#039;re good for.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Let&#039;s do it the other way around,&quot; Juanita says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence is intended to make the book more entertaining, at least--science fiction readers buy books much more preoccupied with killing than Snow Crash. And it is partly satirical, and Hiro is mocked (gently, compared to the treatment that just about everyone and everything else in the book gets) for it, but there is also a bonding between him and Raven, and Raven and Enzo, over their willingness to fight. A willingness that is needed, to survive in, and save, the America of the future.  For all his parodying, I think that Stephenson, whose vision of America is all the more nightmarish because it is one big free-fire zone, thinks this willingness is worthy of praise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing that concerns me, partly because of the way this novel follows Slow River in our Syllabus: in the not-too-distant future of cyberpunk, Is homosexuality an anachronism? After reading a few cyberpunk novels, I am beginning to wonder about the future of the love that dares not speak its name. Whether due to authorial puritanism or purposeful absence, there is an extreme void in the fiction of Neal Stephenson and William Gibson when it comes to either man-to-man or woman-to-woman love. Gibson skirts around the issue by being farely prudish about sex in general. In Neuromancer, the one encounter between Molly and Case is empty, and lacks any substantial repercussions on either character. Sex is like cyberspace, plug-in and plug-out, only cyberspace is the much more enjoyable of the two activities.  Snow Crash treats sexuality as virtually unchanged from today (with a few technological enhancements, such as the dentata). A natural sexual tension between YT and Hiro builds up through the novel, and much of the plot revolves around Hiro&#039;s desire to reinstate himself with Juanita, and YT&#039;s fling with Raven. Despite the prominence of the sexual side of human interaction, there are few to no references to homosexuality whatsoever in his novel. Where are they? Identity politics definitely exist (look at the apartheid burb-claves), yet no gay identity.  Stephenson&#039;s vision, where commercialized or self-designed avatars act as go-betweens for human interaction on the Street, both point to a redefinition of identity by the sudden lack of physical context to human interaction. In a sympathetic or even passive reading of Gibson or Stephenson, this redefinition implies an abandonment of sexual politics as a viable means of forming community. Considering the embracing of the Internet and WWW by the gay community, the absence of homosexuality in these futurist settings is problematic.  Well, I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Personal vs. social responsibility</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/265</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that the most interestig part of Snow Crash was Stephenson&#039;s ideas about what would take the place of government in a lawless society. The Mafia is the most obvious example of this. An organization that has always had to hide to some extent in our society is right out in the open in this futuristic America, and what is more, it seems to be one of the most enlightened ruling groups around. For example, when Jason mistakenly hand-delivers his package to Uncle Enzo, the contrast between the Mafia-controlled block and the ones held by Narcolombians are emphasized. On the Mafia block, &quot;Old ladies are walking the streets again. Children are waiting for schoolbuses and playing hopscotch on sidewalks that recently were stained with blood.&quot; (144) In contrast, when Jason is driving through the Narcolombian neighborhoods of Compton, he is constantly being shot at. Essentially, the Mafia has become a symbol of order, rather than one of lawlessness.&lt;br /&gt;
      The development of the Mafia in this way is actually fairly reasonable when one looks at the values that seem to have come to be respected in this new America. The story of the nearly late pizza early on in the book is a good example. Hiro feels completely justified taking absurd, impossible risks - to deliver a pizza on time. Of course, what is at stake is not the price of the pizza, but credibility. In a world with little or no legal accountability, the importance of personal accountability is magnified. A delivery company that promises to deliver in 30 minutes has to hold itself accountable, because the customers know that there is no one else with the power to do so. Paradoxically, because reneging on a contract has few legal ramifications, it becomes unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;
     This idea of personal or organizational as oppose to social responsibility and loyalty shows up in other places as well. For example, when Y.T. is caught by the MetaCops, she calls her boyfriend Roadkill for help: &quot;&#039;you&#039;re my boyfriend,&#039; she says, speaking very simply and plainly. &#039;If I get popped, you&#039;re supposed to come around and help bust me out.&#039; Isn&#039;t everyone supposed to know this stuff? Don&#039;t parents teach their kids anything anymore?&quot; (78) To Y.T., it is completely obvious that part of being a boyfriend is helping get one&#039;s girlfriend away form the cops. It doesn&#039;t seem like she&#039;s even really making a request here. She&#039;s not saying, &quot;please help me.&quot; Instead, she&#039;s pointing out Roadkill&#039;s personal responsiblity to her, a responsibility that she sees as binding. Again, personal responsiblity seems to take the role that leal or social responsiblity takes in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the parody of ethnicity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/264</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During the student led discussion on Monday the issue of Asian representation in Snow Crash was brought up.  The concern was voiced that depicting Asians as a single race was reverting back to when Westerners refused to differentiate between Asians. While in many attempts the book does reject stereotypes, there are still unyielding definitions of race.  While I wholly agree that these are legitimate observations, I feel that Stephenson made the subversive decision to not distinguish between any of the races.  There is a sense, certainly in the Metaverse, that people no longer feel the need to use their ethnicity as a primary method of identification.  In a world where money has lost its value and everyone is sovereign, geography and culture have become inconsequential.  Not surprisingly, this translates to a lack of human attachment to one&#039;s ethnic group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a technically advanced world as Metaverse, self-representation is constructed in a new and bizarre way.  The players may not be constrained by their race but their socioeconomic circumstances certainly play a factor.  Avatars are still recognized by their class within the economy.  People enter the virtual reality to escape their own reality but they cannot escape the fact that wealth equals power.  The Metaverse does not allow one&#039;s imaginations to run free; rather it reinforces the restraints of real life.  On that note, I found it interesting that often, the avatars did not attempt to lead their lives that differently than they did in the non-virtual world.  Also, was anyone else humored by the fact that one could make his penis as large as he so desired but could not be taller than he was in real life?  Very oddâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the issue of blending ethnicities, I was interested in what the Mafia symbolized.  Of course, it lived up to the traditional connotations of the Mafia with its emphasis being on the &quot;family&quot; and loyalty.  Snow Crash&#039;s Mafia, however, is not solely comprised of the stereotypical Italian gangsters.  On the contrary, this Mafia&#039;s family has Jamaicans, Mexicans and Asians.  Having nothing to do with blood, the Mafia is an organization of many races that still bases its principles on respect and of course, hierarchy.  Hiro Protagnoist exists within an array of ethnicities and cultures.  His first job in the novel is delivering pizzas for the Mafia.  He lives in Mr. Lee&#039;s Hong Kong and has a Russian roommate.  A underlying commonality between the characters is that they are not concerned with someone&#039;s ethnic background.  They are instead all driven by the Mafia attitude â€“ how will this person help me get what I want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I believe that, like the majority of the novel&#039;s themes, the representation of race is satirical.  How can one even place importance on ethnicity when the majority of time is spent in a virtual world where your persona is completely your own creation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>(disjointed) Snow Crash/ eXistenZ response.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/263</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had serious trouble organizing my thoughts while writing this, partly from confusion induced after watching eXistenZ, but here are a few of my thoughts the movie and book together.&lt;br /&gt;
	The difference that I saw in between eXistenZ and Snow Crash was in the great divergence between both the means of entering the Metaverse vs. eXistenZ and the nature of the physical and moral dilemmas that both sides face.  Snow Crash had both viral and moral dilemmas in the Snow Crash virus itself and the underlying religious purposes behind it.  eXistenZ had the moral problem of substituting an entirely realistic &#039;false&#039; world for the real one, in a fashion very near to The Matrix, and the corporeal problems of the creation and use of the different &#039;game pods.&#039;  However, unlike The Matrix, in eXistenZ, it was largely impossible to discover who indeed were the &#039;good guys&#039; and the &#039;bad guys.&#039;  The mix of never knowing what was or wasn&#039;t reality and everyone having different, rapidly changing motives gave this a mystical depth that I think surpasses that of both Snow Crash and The Matrix.&lt;br /&gt;
	To the Realists in eXistenZ, the world that the game programmers create (if they even exist at all) is a threat to morality in that not only does it make the real world less important, it gives its players a world in which there is no real consequence for their actions short of &#039;losing&#039; the game.  This parallels the moral standpoint of video games making players more violent, but to such a realistic extent as to make the &#039;real&#039; violence and the &#039;game&#039; violence indistinguishable.  A sort of paradox similar to the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy is created for the player, in that whatever they think they are doing by their own free will is in fact merely advancing the plot line.  For example, when Jude Law stands up in the Chinese restaurant and yells, &quot;eXistenZ is paused!&quot; he appears to wake up in the room they entered the game from, when in fact later we learn they have only shifted scenes within the game.  I suppose what I am trying to get at here is that since the players can never be sure they are out of the game or not, they can go one of two routes.  They can act as they would in real life, not doing anything major to disrupt the social structure, or they can act on impulse and do as they please (i.e., shoot the waiter.)&lt;br /&gt;
 	After watching eXistenZ, I attempted to think of anything that would seem as weird to people in the past as the game pods appears to us, and I honestly could not think of anything close.  There are similarities in robot prosthetics, but even then, only some of our most advanced prosthetics can use our own nervous systems to recreate natural movements as close to our own, and none can draw all of their power from the body itself as the pods do.  They struck me as technically nothing more than parasites or symbiotic organisms to the human body, only without even any function on their own.  No free will, no purposeful movement; only memory storage.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>MMORPG&#039;s: A blur between reality and virtual reality is already here</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/262</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a combination of theories and ideas that have been thrown around in a variety of classes, I have found myself writing a screenplay treatment that centers on the concept of virtual reality and the place of identity.  An interesting theme that arises in Snow Crash, eXistenZ, and Neuromancer is the complications involved in creating a virtual version of oneself.  In Snow Crash, there is the scene where Hiro engages in a sword fight with someone in the Black Sun.  His avatar in the Metaverse was manipulating his own code in order to defeat his opponent, while his physical form in actual reality was carrying out the movements necessary for the battle, whence the unnerved audience he had when he had finished.  One of the confusions of movement in the Metaverse is how the characters are controlled, as it seems they can walk around, ride motorcycles, and be moved by other avatars with only their mind control, but for the intricacies of sword play, the physical body must move.  However, for the most part, Hiro creates a copy of himself to wander around the Metaverse, somewhat in the capacity of a vehicle through virtual reality.&lt;br /&gt;
eXistenZ takes a very different approach to VR.  Considering the bioports and the game console situation within the game with the animal part pods, the whole situation revolves around an actual interface with the body involving connection through blood and tissue.  You do not create a new character, but have your own body, just the way it appears in reality.  The way this vision of VR functions it comes off as more of a controlled hallucination or specifically engineered dream experience than the slightly less &quot;realistic&quot; VR of Snow Crash.  There is very little control on the part of the player and one feels entirely ruled by the story line of the game.&lt;br /&gt;
The way I see Neuromancer relating to this is in the concept of the Construct.  Somehow, in Gibson&#039;s view of the future of virtual realities and technology, a person&#039;s personality, their identity (up to a certain point) can be saved onto what equates to a floppy disk and moved around, loaded onto computers and forced to exist in cyberspace without a body like some kind of technological limbo.  While the Flatline had no concept of time, he was more than just a conglomeration of the former being&#039;s memories and skills, he also had the sense of humor, a laugh (as disconcerting as it may have been to Case) and the desire to be erased, released from the cyberspace cage in which he was saved.&lt;br /&gt;
I find all three of these versions of VR to be fascinating, and elements of each are incorporated into my idea of VR in my screenplay.  The character wrote her own VR world as an escape, a nostalgic playground to represent all that the current government structure had taken away.  It plays with the conflict between controlling the image of oneself, as Hiro does, and also the surreal interplay between cyberspace and real life, where it becomes uncertain whether one&#039;s involvement with a virtual world can be more real than the real world because of the importance placed in time spent there and one&#039;s identity in that space.  Dixie had no choice about his personality being saved, and when he was consulted, he chose to be released.  However, in eXistenZ, the lines between reality and the virtual game reality were so badly blurred that it became almost impossible to distinguish them.  When the American Jude Law character came out of the game within a game for the first time he found that it all felt unreal and he experienced extreme disorientation.  Having had periods of my life where I could play six to eight straight hours of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), it seems that the level of technology in these books and movies is unnecessary for one to lose the connection between mind and body, neglecting the physical reality and placing the needs of the virtual character first.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Swordplay in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/260</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading Snow Crash, the most consistently jarring ( as in, taking me out of the story ) aspect was Hiro&#039;s swordplay. Though he&#039;s the greatest hacker in the world ( both real world and Metaverse ), he&#039;s equally proud of being the greatest swordsman. He carries his katanas everywhere, and uses them extensively-- not just in the Metaverse, but the real world. A modern-day samurai, with the emphasis on &quot; modern-day &quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s obviously a lot of entertainment inherent to the sword fights, and a lot of that is due to romanticizing the sword. Though rendered obsolete by the invention of guns, swords are arguably more attractive, take more skill to use, are more visceral in the way they dispatch foes. Anyone can point a gun and shoot ( hitting the target being more difficult ), but swordsmanship is a difficult skill, even an art. No wonder they remain popular in fiction, despite being much rarer in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties perfectly into Hiro&#039;s identity; one, in terms of a skill that he would want to practice ( he defines himself by mastering complex tasks, either hacking or swordplay ), two, in terms of ethnic identity ( the Japanese/Nipponese aspects of his background are symbolized in the way he carries his swords with him everywhere ), and three, just as an expression of maschismo. It&#039;s all well and good, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that this is not Fuedal Japan, this is a Cyberpunk future where firearms are everywhere.  I can get him using his swords in the virtual world, but in reality? Where he&#039;s surrounded by enemies with guns? Where sticking around to cut people up would logically make him a huge target and resultantly get him filled with lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&#039;s a lot of this &quot; Rule of Cool &quot; stuff in Snow Crash, things like rocketboards and supersonic cyborg attack dogs and what not, but this is particularly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Information Obsession</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/259</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found most interesting about Snow Crash was its treatment of information.  Clearly in this world information, or &quot;intel&quot; abounds.  The desire for information takes precedence over privacy, as exemplified by Hiro&#039;s experience with the Mob, described at the very beginning of the novel, &quot;he&#039;s in their database now...retinal patterns, DNA, void graph fingerprints, foot prints, palm prints, wrist prints, every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on it and digitized it into their computer&quot; (6).  This information typically not help private by whoever took record of it.  You either need cash or clearance to access any given piece, but once you have those things, the information you can expose yourself to is pretty unlimited, and accessible, as evidenced by Hiro&#039;s description of the Gargoyles.  &quot;You think they&#039;re talking to you,&quot; he explains &quot;but they&#039;re actually poring over the credit record of some stranger on the other side of the room, or identifying the make and model of airplanes plying overhead&quot; (125).&lt;br /&gt;
	I found this reminiscent of the net in &quot;Stars in my Pocket.&quot;  Access to the huge database of information is more widespread in Delany&#039;s world than in Snow Crash, but for those who can access it, the scale of the information seems to be just as broad.  However, the implications of these huge collections of data were different in the two novels.  In Delany&#039;s novel, being exposed to such absurd quantities of information seemed to make any given piece of information arbitrary.  Since it was so obvious that any given person knew such a small proportion of the total information, they didn&#039;t really think of facts as objective things, rather they&#039;re thought of as on the same level as poetry.  The interpretation of information was more important than the information itself.  But in &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; information is power, and money.  Hiro supports himself by collecting &quot;intel&quot; and collecting royalties whenever anyone pays to access it.  Even the most inane of conversations have the potential to bring in the big bucks.  In The Black Sun he overhears a screenwriter complaining about a director who wanted to put a bazooka in a movie.  After Hiro puts the conversation into the Library &quot;a hundred struggling screenwriters will call this conversation up, listen to it over and over until they&#039;ve got it memorized, paying Hiro for the privilege&quot; (65).&lt;br /&gt;
	The obsession with information even bleeds into the narrative of the novel.  The first two pages are rife with metaphor.  &quot;His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.  A bullet will bounce off its arachno-fiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest.  Where his body has bony extremities the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.  To me, this goes beyond world building and screams &quot;Look! I know so much that I can use the properties of activated charcoal and napalm in similes!&quot; Everything is cross-linked and referenced the way that Hiro links up the information he puts in the library.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Heroes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if anyone here has ever watched Heroes, the television show, but whoever was in charge of the script for that show apparently loves Snow Crash.  There&#039;s the fact that they also named their protagonist Hiro (though I was prepared to write that off as a coincidence, because it is still a play on words).  And then I came across Odessa Texas (which is where most of the action is centered in the first season).  No way is that a coincidence, right?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The colors of Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/257</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I might take a look at the use of color in this novel. After all, the story has a lot of powerful imagery, and it was originally meant to be a &quot;computer-generated graphic novel&quot;, so the design of the imagery must have demanded a lot of attention. Even the title of the book, &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; is a term with some intrinsic color qualities. A snow crash displays &quot;white noise&quot;, &quot;a pattern of black-and-white pixels&quot; (73-74). The black-and-white of the snow crash is a very bad thing: it&#039;s associated with nonsense, an extremely primitive fault with a machine. If you see a snow crash, you&#039;ve witnessed a &quot;system crash... at such a fundamental level&quot; that the graphics output fails (42). It&#039;s both menacing and something to scoff at, a simple failure; a properly-protected computer shouldn&#039;t suffer a snow crash, but if it has been infected with a virus, it might. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also the black-and-white avatars, which tend to draw suspicion and distaste from everyone else. These are &quot;persons who are accessing the Metaverse through cheap public terminals... a lot of whom are run-of-the-mill psycho fans&quot; (41). The grainy black-and-white avatars represent a sort of lower class of Metaverse user, and that lower class apparently consists of generic yet obnoxious characters. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you took a hypercard from a black-and-white person,&quot; Hiro says to Da5id, implying that Da5id would have to be very stupid to do that. It implies that black-and-white people are dangerously unaccountable, and consequently something to distrust or scorn. This is pretty consistent with the black-and-white of the snow crash: in both cases, the grainy mixture of black and white is associated with something both mundane and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, black by itself, or rather, black &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; itself, is associated with power within the novel. The uniform Hiro wears when he is The Deliverator is &quot;black as activated charcoal&quot; (1), making him &quot;a grim vision in ninja black&quot; (5), and &quot;his car is an invisible black lozenge, just a dark place that reflects... the loglo&quot; (7). The equipment of the Deliverator is associated with efficiency, danger, and power. He is stealthy, very fast, and wields tools that are immensely powerful, and all of these tools are black. Similarly, the Metaverse&#039;s number one hacker hangout is &quot;a squat black pyramid&quot; with &quot;a matte black hemisphere... set in the front wall&quot; - &quot;THE BLACK SUN&quot; (39-40). It&#039;s another case of black-on-black, a combination that (unlike black-and-white) is associated with the few most powerful, most dangerous individuals in the Metaverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the colors of advertisements and other businesses. The Kourier service wears a combination of &quot;orange and blue&quot; (13), and the Enforcers uniform is an &quot;acid green uniform&quot; (122). Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong, one of the safest parts of town, is signified by &quot;a green-and-blue sign, soothing and calm in a glare-torn franchise ghetto&quot; (83). The various franchises, and their meaning to the main characters especially, are reflected in the colors they choose for their advertising. Green is security; blue is calm; and orange is flashy but still hip when combined with blue. On the contrary, &quot;cheap, nasty franchises all tend to adopt logos with a lot of bright, hideous yellow in them&quot; (145). These bright, ugly logos are like &quot;radioactive urine&quot;  (145) â€“ associated with the disgusting human waste, and probably something that would be dangerous to be exposed to. In other words, all kinds of bright colors are associated with different franchises, but the colors used tend to say something useful about that franchise. This view is both somewhat anticorporate (the distaste for certain franchises) and simultaneously rooted in the kind of psychology that corporate consumerism requires (the association of colors with brands, with the hope that brands can identify themselves as high-quality simply by choosing the right colors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even the colored uniform of of the couriers, &quot;fly as it may be&quot;, is not always advantageous (259). Even Y.T., who&#039;s normally a very brightly-colored person, between her blond hair and the Kourier uniform, resorts to becoming a &quot;black angel&quot; when it comes down to dangerous business (259). This is when the power-of-the-hackers black convention meets the bright-franchise-colors convention: when Y.T. is working for her franchise, she uses the colors, but when she wants power she reverts her clothing to black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So throughout the book, lots of colors have pretty strong associations. Black-and-white noise is cheap, mundane, yet dangerous; yellow is disgusting and unhealthy; green is security, and blue is placidity. And of course, though I haven&#039;t discussed it here, red is danger. These associations mostly hold pretty consistently throughout the novel, which both makes it powerful as a visual experience and acts as a subtle but defining feature of the corporately-defined system of &quot;government&quot; and lifestyle that is at the core of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the Metaverse to be the most intriguing part of Snow Crash. It is astounding how much of the Metaverse is reflected in many current online entertainment programs, like World of Warcraft and Second Life as discussed in class. Stephenson has created an entirely believable future culture that is heavily rooted in technology because we are already seeing aspects of Snow Crash in today&#039;s world, like the aforementioned online games. There are people all over the world who are engaged in alternate lives on the internet in various MMORPGs and online communities, mirroring what people do in Snow Crash by using the Metaverse. For me, the idea of being able to create a completely new persona of your choice and then enter another world is simultaneously cool and disturbing. It is obviously cool because you can do things in the Metaverse that you cannot do in reality. The possibilities of what you can do in the Metaverse are essentially limitless â€“ as long as you have a good imagination and skill with programming, you can create whatever you want. For example, in Hiro&#039;s case, he can unleash his sword fighting abilities on other people without worry of consequences and even fit himself into sword fighting rankings. In addition, you can also completely customize your Metaverse persona, called your avatar â€“ &quot;Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment. If you&#039;re ugly, you can make your avatar beautiful. If you&#039;ve just gotten out of bed, your avatar can still be wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied makeup. You can look like a gorilla or a dragon or a giant talking penis in the Metaverse. Spend five minutes walking down the Street and you will see all of these&quot; (36). Thus, the greatest appeal of the Metaverse is giving people the opportunity to choose how they want to live and be whoever they want to be. Ultimately, though, while I think having some sort of virtual reality like the Metaverse would be cool in some respects, I feel that many aspects of the Metaverse are disturbing. Usage of the Metaverse sparks difficult questions, the main one being what is the point of being in reality when you can do whatever you want in the Metaverse? After all, &quot;Hiro spends a lot of time in the Metaverse. It beats the shit out of the U-Stor-It&quot; (24). I suppose the Metaverse is nice for people who are not satisfied with their lives, but at the same time, escaping into the Metaverse only perpetuates their real life problems because instead of devoting time towards managing reality, they can escape into virtual reality. Furthermore, social stratification occurs in the Metaverse too, making it a sort of fool&#039;s gold. Although there is freedom to customize your avatar in the Metaverse, wealth is required for sophisticated avatars. Consequently, the real life social status of people can be deduced through how nice their avatar looks â€“ for example, &quot;When white-trash high school girls are going on a date in the Metaverse, they invariably run down to the computer-games section of the local Wal-Mart and buy a copy of Brandy. The user can select three breast sizes: improbable, impossible, and ludicrous. Brandy has a limited repertoire of facial expressions: cute and pouty; cute and sultry; perky and interested; smiling and receptive; cute and spacy. Her eyelashes are half an inch long, and the software is so cheap that they are rendered as solid ebony chips&quot; (37). In the end, people run to the Metaverse for the promise of a better life there, only to encounter the same problems that they face in real life. The wealthiest people in reality are still dominating the Metaverse, getting into the best clubs and owning the best property. It seems that the Metaverse amounts to mainly a potentially harmful distraction to people, sucking away them away from real life to false hope in a virtual life.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anal Play</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/255</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Point the first: eXistenZ equates its VR game with sodomy. Ted says he doesn&#039;t like to be penetrated; Allegra sexily lubes up his &quot;tight&quot; bioport before his &quot;first time&quot;; of course, when we get a look at the bioport, it looks like an asshole; then there&#039;s the really great bioport sex scene, in which Ted tongues Allegra&#039;s bioport, she responds with surprise, then arousal, then Ted, you know, fucks her in the bioport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this might be a somewhat less pressing question for the film and for the nature of VR games in general (it&#039;s in this context that we&#039;re putting eXistenZ in apposition to Snow Crash) since it&#039;s Cronenberg at the helm. Anyone who&#039;s seen Videodrome will remember the VCR-vagina that spontaneously appears in the middle of James Woods&#039;s chest, and how James Woods masturbates his VCR-vagina with a gun and then loses the gun in said orifice. It&#039;s weird and creepy and typically Cronenbergian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the stakes are somewhat different in eXistenZ. In this case, the anal nature of the bioport suffuses Ted and Allegra&#039;s discourse. For the first twenty minutes or so, any off-hand remark about Ted&#039;s gaming inexperience is also a prurient sexual remark, in which Ted is figured as the submissive (&quot;passive&quot; would typically be better, I guess, but seems less appropriate for describing the dynamics of these scenes) partner in anal sex--e.g., &quot;You&#039;ll see how natural it feels.&quot; Under other circumstances, such lines wouldn&#039;t have the same bizarre sexual charge that they do here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has clear anxieties about the use of VR; in the final scene, Ted and Allegra accuse the game Evgeny of bastardizing reality. In a way, it makes sense that the sexual appeal of VR would be the sexual appeal of sodomy.  In Christian history, the typical reason for banning sodomy--which can include anal and oral sex, obviously--has to do not with how you do it, but why; sodomy opposes reproductive sex, which is regarded as the only good form of sex. In class, we talked a little about the seeming absurdity of wanting to accumulate Linden dollars--what&#039;s the point? is the standard take. Put value-intensively, one might say, why not do something *actually* productive? Instead, we could think of VR commerce as a sodomitical commerce. Whatever threat inheres in VR is the threat of the nonproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Plague Hits WoW</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/253</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In case anyone wanted more information on the disease that spread through World of Warcraft, here&#039;s the official BBC article about it:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm&quot; title=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm&quot;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some experts discussing the practicality of modeling disease in a virtual world:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm&quot; title=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm&quot;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m amused the second one is actually in the &quot;Health&quot; section of BBC, rather than &quot;Technology&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>slow river and corporations</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/251</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the &quot;subplots&quot; that make up this novel, I found the Lore/Sal Bird -- Magyar one the most intriguing. In the beginning it definitely inspires a disgust for the corporate machine and how little it seems to care about the consumers of its &quot;product&quot;, which is essential to life: water. All of this seems to suggest that in a technological age, one of humanity&#039;s few remaining weaknesses is its dependence on greedy profit-driven corporations for survival, which is certainly true of our real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was stunned that Magyar ends up falling in love with Lore/Sal Bird; I thought that Magyar would just be the thorn in Lore&#039;s side, the annoying boss who is intimidated by her intelligence and pretends that Lore&#039;s work isn&#039;t good enough to save some face. However, in this section of menial worker ants, Lore is probably the only one who has ever given Magyar a good challenge.  But this ending kind of bothered me because of how &quot;Hollywood&quot; it was...walking away hand in hand &#039;into the sunset&#039; per se. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Magyar in some ways is made to seem more traditionally &quot;feminine&quot; than Spanner (mainly implied by numerous references to her glorious hair swishing behind her), thus suggesting that the best kind of lesbian relationship can only happen between two &quot;feminine&quot; women. I was glad that someone brought this up in class because although it&#039;s clear that Griffith sets out to break a lot of boundaries and go against readers&#039; expectations, she also goes along with some other stereotypes (the porno lesbian being the main one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&#039;s my rant on this novel; not my favorite, but certainly innovative when it comes to sexuality and gender issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>where to start that research?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/250</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been meaning to bring this up in class for the last week, and only today during office hours, while talking with a member of the class, did I suddenly remember:  given that many of you are science/math/otherwise non-English majors, you might want a pointer or two on how to start your research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing is this:  don&#039;t use Google Scholar; it&#039;s crap when it comes to the humanities.  And don&#039;t start with JStor -- you&#039;ll get there, but it&#039;s not the place to begin.  Begin on the library&#039;s home page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://libraries.claremont.edu&quot; title=&quot;http://libraries.claremont.edu&quot;&gt;http://libraries.claremont.edu&lt;/a&gt;, but please don&#039;t tell me if you didn&#039;t already know that), and in the center of the page, click on the &quot;most used databases&quot; drop-down menu.  What you want is the MLA Bibliography; everything published in literary and cultural studies is indexed in this bibliography, including all of the journals in JStor or Project Muse, but many, many others besides.  The MLA Bibliography also indexes articles in edited volumes, which no other electronic database will help you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:  MLA Bibliography.  Start there.  If you find yourself stuck, talk to your friendly neighborhood research librarian; Gale Burrow is the literature specialist, and she&#039;ll likely be tremendous help.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Living in a fish-eye lens, caught in the camera eye</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/249</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking elements in Nicola Griffith&#039;s Slow River is the use of cameras.  Throughout the text, the picture seen by the camera somehow shows a raw truth, and is able to catch characters at their most vulnerable moments, and with Lore, somehow seems to draw out her vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the camera is first introduced when Lore is taped begging for ransom.  Her vulnerability at this moment and the total stripping of her defenses by her captors shows an underlying truth of a scared child.  What is more interesting, though, is how knowing others have seen this video creates a level of paranoia in Lore once she escapes.  She has a constant fear (though the intensity of it caries as time passes) that she will be recognized from the video.  She both does not want to go back to her family, and, more importantly, does not want people to associate her with the person who was trapped in the camera&#039;s eye.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore uses the camera against others, specifically Ruth and Ellen, she feels guilt, but she also feels justified in her actions.  Though she cries as she films her friends, she responds to Ruth&#039;s subsequent confrontation by thinking &quot;You&#039;ve seen pictures of me in far more humiliating circumstances; and my abductors did not even have the courtesy to swap my head for another&#039;s&quot; (197).  This point is interesting in several ways.  When Lore is in control, there is a sense that she has earned it, and that being the one wielding the camera is some sort of ultimate control.  There is also the issue of body over face.  Yes, the face is far more recognizable than the body to people.  Yet Ruth implies that, in the situation of sex, especially in porn, it is not the faces that matter, but the body that is being traded and it is the body that becomes identity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore was younger, she made porn films of her parents using stock bodies and grafting her parents&#039; heads on the bodies.  When there s film, it is what is filmed that is directly important--any edits become the work of fantasy.  Lore&#039;s manipulation of her parents&#039; heads and environment on film does not violate them, because she did not actually capture them in a moment of weakness.  It is this capture, this trap that film creates, that is so important n the text, and which justifies Ruth&#039;s anger and sense of betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore manipulates the consensual footage she takes of Tom, he says he does not want to see the final result because he doesn&#039;t want to see himself looking confused and old and pathetic.  There is again the sense that what the camera sees becomes truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final, and perhaps most important use of the camera, comes when Lore tells the story of her life to the camera to be used as a starting point for evidence for the police.  When she sets up the camera, she observes &quot;The camera lens was like a cold fish eye, unblinking.  I stared at it, forgetting what I was supposed to say&quot; (326).  The overwhelmingness of being exposed, laid bare to the camera is shown here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the interesting concept of the fisheye lens.  There is the sense that the camera sees more than a normal eye would see, that there is no escape and there is no ability to hide any part of oneself, really, when presented with the camera.  It speaks to Tom&#039;s fear, that there is a part of himself that really is that confused old man, and Ruth&#039;s anger at her violation by the camera, the capturing of her body against her will, and Lore&#039;s kidnapping being all the more humiliating because her degraded self was shown to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tank Girl v. Barbarella</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/248</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious if anybody has any thoughts on the similarities and differences between Tank Girl and Barbarella -- the fact that they were both originally comic book characters got me started on this line of thought. Both seem to be a fairly extreme extrapolation of a certain notion of a strong female character; Tank Girl seems to operate through violence and general social domination, while Barbarella is, essentially, sex (though with the numerous shots of Tank Girl astride her tank&#039;s gun, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some overlap between the two). Both also seem to be products of their time periods, Tank Girl embodying the punk aesthetic of the late 80s/early 90s, and Barbarella building on the sex kitten/Birgitte Bardot idea of sexuality in the 60s. The shift between the two seems quite interesting to me, with Barbarella being the idealized product of her society, while Tank Girl is completely detached from societal standards. If anyone has a more lucid analysis, I&#039;d like to hear it; I just wrapped up the movie and haven&#039;t had time to properly collect all my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Katerine the Corporate Monster</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/247</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicola Griffith&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Slow River&lt;/em&gt; is an acclaimed piece of science fiction, and insofar as it has realistic portrayals of the interactions between chemistry, biology, corporations, and the environment, it&#039;s a very successful book. But when it comes to the personal and family intrigue, the book has problems. Too many times, the characters&#039; motivations are in question, so the plausibility of the novel suffers. Katerine, especially, is a character whose actions are never fully explicated, who serves as a major antagonist without a cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first encounter Katerine as the one who resisted her husband&#039;s push to have their genes returned to normal. The gray hair is a way of &quot;saying to the world, look, I&#039;m so rich I can afford to have this expensive anticancer treatment&quot; and even though Oster thinks they should turn the gene back on, Katerine &quot;want[s] [Lore] to have all the visible trappings of the rich and powerful&quot; (52). It&#039;s not entirely clear why this is the case. In fact, it seems rather narrow-sighted, or selfish, for Katerine to do this, though plausible that she&#039;s doing it for the sake of her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the important scene where Lore wakes to &quot;the monster... breathing hot fire on her neck and groaning like a beast&quot; (68). Katerine in this scene makes a small effort at being comforting, but really she just seems to dismiss Lore&#039;s bothers, asking &quot;How could it have got in?&quot; and calling it &quot;Just a dream&quot; (68). We later discover that this is because Katerine herself is the &quot;monster&quot; and she must be trying to hide it. But we never find out why she does this. Presumably Katerine has some sort of perverse sexuality, but there&#039;s never a scene where she explains how she fought against it, or came to accept it, or how she developed it in the first place. Oster, in the same scene, is comforting and helpful. He &quot;takes her hand&quot; and tries to soothe her, offers to &quot;find a lock&quot; for her door immediately, while Katerine is heading off for some &quot;net conference&quot; the next morning (68-69). It is stated that Oster&#039;s actions, throughout the book, are motivated in part by competing with his wife for Lore&#039;s affection, but his behavior (unlike Katerine&#039;s) tends also to be the nurturing love of a parent, whereas Katerine seems caught up in the corporation all the time, and spurns family matters that don&#039;t interact with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is significant that Oster, not Katerine, is the one who &quot;is fond of saying&quot; that &quot;the company is not the same as the family&quot; (103). This is because, for Katerine, they are the same. When Katerine wants to spend family time with Lore, she &quot;scribbles some catalytic reaction equation on a napkin&quot; and sends &quot;case studies... over the net&quot; while her father &quot;suggests they go look for tree frogs&quot; or &quot;talks... about the new species of carp&quot; (108). Katerine seems focused on training her daughter to be the perfect member of the van der Oest business, not so much on letting her develop as an individual. Katerine&#039;s idea of family fun time is the same as school time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Katerine is totally consumed by her business, and placed in stark contrast with Oster, who barely involves himself in the family business, instead concentrating on whimsical pet projects; but when Lore has a difficult time, Katerine is the one at fault, and Oster is the one who supports her. This speaks to the problems of being so consumed by work that one loses everything else, and that is the only thing approaching an explanation for what makes Katerine a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Some thoughts on Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/246</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am still not sure if Slow River falls into my personal definitions of science fiction.  Obviously, it takes place in the future, and there are extrapolative qualities to the narrative, but it does not seem &quot;sciency&quot; enough to me.  The water parts, although interesting, do not have the same glamorous appeal as interstellar space travel.  One of the most fascinating areas of the novel, to me, was the role of pleasure in manipulating its victims&#039; lives.  Like Molly from Neuromancer, Lore and Spanner utilize a futuristic method to distance themselves from the reality of selling their bodies to men.  However, the implication remains that there is no true escape from prostitution.  Although the drug makes the act itself more pleasurable, eventually one needs to wake up.  Both Molly and Lore have rude awakenings to this fact, and both are forced to continue prostituting themselves once they stop using the drugs.&lt;br /&gt;
	I am interested in the role that prostitution plays in many of the novels that we have read so far.  Obviously, there is the futuristic whorehouse of Neuromancer, and there is the twosome prostitution of Lore and Spanner in Slow River.  However, there is also the necessary prostitution of the humans in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  I am not quite sure if prostitution is the right word, but there is an implied obligation to having sex with the Oankali in order to stay in their good graces.  Again, in Lilith&#039;s Brood, pleasure is used as the seductor for sex, and it proves to be a powerful tool for the Oankali.  Why do all of these novels portray pleasure in such a negative fashion? Or is it simply the manipulation and excess of pleasure that is the real problem?&lt;br /&gt;
	On a somewhat-unrelated note (sorry for the rambling nature of this response paper, but there were so many interesting aspects of Slow River!), I liked her name-choices, although some were a little bit obvious.  The article that we read for today mentioned the hedonistic implications of the plant&#039;s name, but I felt like that was only one of the novel&#039;s many Dickenson-worthy names.  I brought this up in class, but I found it interesting that all of her siblings&#039; names had some sort of fairy-tale connection.  I was trying to remember where I had heard the name Tok from, and I just realized last night that he is a character from The Wizard of Oz collection.  It seemed completely contradictory that Griffith chose to give such a cold family fantasy-related names, but perhaps this irony was what she really wanted for the Van de Oest family.  In addition to the family itself, my presentation group talked a little bit about Spanner and what her name implies.  Although she seems firmly planted in her sector of society (Lore notes the fact that she has found her niche in the underworld), she also seems to have her hand in everything.  There is always the sense that Spanner knows much more than she lets on, although she too is duped by the pleasure-inducing drug.&lt;br /&gt;
	Because there are implications for the other characters&#039; names, I really want to know why Griffith chose to call the manager of the plant Magyar.  It is the Hungarian term for themselves, and I cannot help but wonder why she chose this word.  Maybe it is just the Hungarian blood in me, but I really want to know why!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Identity and Morality</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/245</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of different tenses to describe the different phases of Lore&#039;s life, as intertwined in Slow River, is clearly open to interpretation.  To the degree that the last phase, chronologically, is the one in which first person is used, one might say that Lore simply identifies most with her current incarnation, and that the tale told from ten years further on would invoke the first person only for events later still.  However, it seems possible that the use of third person reflects Lore&#039;s conscious dissociation from herself as she existed before the advent of Sal Bird the second.  One delineated difference between Lore in the different timelines is her relationship with morality.  The Lore of the first sequence (until the kidnapping), seems to have little or no relationship with the construct of morality.  She has occasional snatches of empathy, but her code seems to be loyalty to family, and honor of that which is correct or effective.  Her actions, while not particularly reprehensible, are never placed in a context of morality, despite the fact that, as she later find out, they may be associated with any level of damage to many people.&lt;br /&gt;
By contrast, although her actions with Spanner are harmful on a much smaller scale, Lore seems to feel a constant need to justify herself, or at least a growing concern that she doesn&#039;t feel guilty.  This shift may be a result of greater maturity.  It can also be related to a tension between Lore&#039;s actions, which she sometimes conceptualizes as part of a faÃ§ade, and her attempts to maintain some sort of separate core self.  Her relationship with morality in this phase seems mostly to consist of feeling guilty for not feeling guilty about what she does to the people around her, most notably Ruth and Ellen.  In the first phase, Lore is entrenched in a place where everyone she knows is functionally above any law that happens to exist around them.  By extension, they seem to avoid any association, positive or negative, with ethics.  The lawsuit in Caracas is handled in a manner calculated to discourage further lawsuits, with no consultation with the concept of moral obligation.  She and her family are much like demi-g&#039;ds.  In the second phase, she&#039;s descended to the level of mere mortals, and thus must abide by their laws, constitutional and moral, or risk suffering the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
In the third phase, Lore&#039;s present, she seems to develop a sense of ethics broader than herself, and rooted on some level a sense of obligation to other people.  She ends up risking exposure or unemployment and a potential return to crime in order to do her job right, and protect the people she works with, as well as the people who drink the water she processes.  She describes her concerns for others as felt, rather than regretted or missed.  From her new perspective, with something of an active moral compass, it makes sense that she would want to dissociate herself from her prior bad acts, and the mindsets that went with them.  She needs to intergrate her experiences in order to process them, and to put herself together, but she&#039;s still trying to escape her past lives, and so she dissociates.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Camera and utilisation in Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/244</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In any world where identity is important, the camera is going to be a focal point of observation.  In Slow River, in response to Tok&#039;s &quot;Find something,&quot; an admonishment to keep Lore sane with the parents she has, Lore acquires a camera and edit board.  Lore&#039;s filmography becomes a very important part of the book.  It shows not only the fluidity of identity, but shows first how perception of identity can change things.  &quot;Lore&#039;s first projects are wish fulfillment,&quot; and are of her parents happy together.  This scene is the first that really spells out how poor her parent&#039;s relationship is.  Then she moves on to porn with her parents faces on the bodies.  From a very early age, she has sexualized the camera and the things she looks through it to see.  The identity through the camera becomes desensitized, and not as real.  This is one of the reasons that lead to the creation of porn with Lore&#039;s movie making skill.  Because her parents never touch, even the touch of porn seems better than no touch at all.&lt;br /&gt;
	Shifting forward chronologically, Lore&#039;s camera becomes a defense mechanism.  She carries it around with her all the time, and avoids both her mother and father&#039;s presences.  Her father stops taking her fishing, and her mother stops trying to talk business with her.  This is when a mutable object defines her identity.  Lore&#039;s identity is defined through her camera, which allows anything seen through its lens to be changed.  This doesn&#039;t allow for a strong sense of identity by lore.  This is also the period of her life where Lore starts dying her hair, another change to her identity that the camera led to.  The identity and defense mechanism comes to a head at Spanner&#039;s home.  During the sex orgy brought about by the drug, Lore is shielded from the action only by her camera.  That is when she realizes that the camera is not truly a shield.  She is still affected by her actions, even years later.  While Ruth nominally gave her permission, Ruth was still hurt by her act, which led to a break down in their relationship anyway.  Even with the identities changed on the other side of the camera, people can still be hurt in their true selves.&lt;br /&gt;
	The last and most important camera scene is the creation of the charity ad.  It creates a huge problem first off, because the equipment is so expensive.  It seems to say that it is extremely difficult to try to perceive things differently than they are.  Spanner gets all of her limbs forcibly dislocated and relocated to try to get the money for the equipment.  That just says another thing about the false identity that the camera can create.  It shows how much Spanner is reaching and trying for that false identity.  As this stage of the novel however, Lore is not making nearly the effort to try to get the equipment for the falsehood.  She has matured in enough ways that she no longer feels the need to hunt out the material to achieve falsehoods.  The charity ad itself is a large falsehood.  Starting with a false charity, where all the money goes to Spanner and Lore, and then being a false advertisement, in place of the show because the rest of the commercial space was filled, to being about a problem which, while real, was not personified by the person used to portray it.  Lore was trying to show the plight of the person born before 1960.  Her subject however, Tom, was fully integrated into his world and had no trouble at all living in it.  In fact, he quite enjoyed it.  The camera had to create a complete falsehood to be successful.  Then, when the ad was given to Tom along with his share of the cut, he did not watch it.  Instead he started on at the news with his impossibly clear eyes, full of truth, and did not watch the falsehood.  That was the last straw, and helped Lore to finally start to realize her true identity, and not an identity created through any kind of construction or lens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The timeline of Slow River....isn&#039;t really a line...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/243</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As was already shown in class by the presentation, the events of the book Slow River, while mixed up and shown out of order, can be lined up to form the majority of Lore&#039;s life.  Beginning in Chapter 2 when Lore is at the age of 5, and ending with her rejoining her Father again at the end of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on first glance it seemed like these events were just thrown together in random order....in a sort of flashback-y way.  A little rough, but not terribly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out though, a closer inspection reveals what I would call a pattern in the chronology.  Or rather, several patterns that relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, it seems that there are two to three separate time-&quot;lines&quot; going, as the story rotates between Lore&#039;s early life (age 5 to her kidnapping and escape) her time with Spanner (beginning with being taken in from the street and ending with Lore leaving the flat) and her life as Sal Bird.  Although I haven&#039;t taken the time to check in detail, these seem to rotate in a sort of order (usually early, mid, then late) with each section bringing another portion of the particular time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting setup to watch in action, and I found it even more so with the fact that the &quot;sections&quot; started getting relatively shorter and closer to the other time periods.  In my mind, I pictured the three timelines as &quot;strands&quot; of time weaving through space, though they weaved together closer and closer until they finally met in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of an odd way to put it I suppose, but that really is what went through my mind.  That and the fact that I could finally put together the entirety of Lore&#039;s life and thus understand the story a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good read....though I wish a little that we could find out more of what happened in the end, even if it was only a sort of epilogue....&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Slow River Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/242</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest questions of morality I saw (and the class talked about) was how Lore never acknowledges the other side of the monopoly argument.  As far as she is concerned, since the van de Oest products are superior to the others, they have the right to dominate the market.  As the son of two educators from a middleclass family, this was about as opposite my thought patterns as possible. The grand revelation she has about her family&#039;s rise to monopoly was all focused on the corruption behind it, not on the nature of the monopoly itself.  This was even after all of her work with Spanner and at the water-purification facility.  The way that Hepple acts is nearly identical to the way the younger Lore reacts to the worker problems on the Russia job, and to her own mother&#039;s response to the families of the children crippled by mistakes in the purification systems.  Between having a peon-level job and having such a money-grubbing, careless boss as Hepple,  I would have thought she would come to revise her opinion of her family&#039;s methods at least a little.  But no, the fault was in Hepple not choosing the expensive superior brand, not the producer&#039;s fault in making the bacteria absolutely dependent on one set of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  After all of her time spent on money schemes with Spanner, it surprised me that she would be naÃ¯ve enough to never recognize how much of a chokehold this kind of production has on the market.  I would say that she believed that her family would never stoop so low as to extort their buyers unjustly, but the way she herself describes her family&#039;s instabilities and lack of empathy rules this out.  She is an odd mix of self-consciousness, guilt, and bewilderment, and only resolves to change at the end of the novel.  Even then, this change is more of an acceptance of the way she feels than an actual resolution to make change things.  I am not saying that this isn&#039;t a monumental step for her, but I just thought things would turn out differently, perhaps with a bit more of a wide-scale change in the world.  Having finally sorted out the true story, she finally decides to return to her family and money, but takes with her the woman representative of all of her struggles.  It just seems like everything worked out too happily for her.  Also, I would like to know more about everyone she left behind, specifically Tom, Kinnis, Cel, and Hepple too.  I was wondering if anything would happen between her and Tom, romantic or not, even with her prior sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>power, knowledge, and self/identity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/241</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In many of the novels we&#039;ve read for this class, information and knowledge have been closely tied to technology and/or power.  The collection and accumulation of information and its practical applications demonstrate and enforce control.  With all of this focus on bettering one&#039;s social and financial status through useful knowledge, what happens to the individual?  In Slow River, as we discussed in class on Monday, Lore has identity issues (illustrated through parallel narratives, different point of views, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in childhood, Lore learned something important: &quot;...at seven Lore is suddenly realizing she can make of herself what she wills.  When she is old enough she can have red hair or golden eyebrows...And no one will tell her she is wrong, because no one will know.  She could become anyone she wishes.  But how will she know she is still herself?&quot; (52).  Even at such a young age, Lore recognizes the implications of knowledge as power over others.  If no one knows what she is supposed to be, then they cannot question what identity she portrays.  At the beginning of the novel, for example, Lore is uncomfortable when she realizes Spanner  knows &quot;all about her&quot; (18).  No PIDA can change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progenies of the social elite are expected to maintain certain standards, whether those standards are on the physical or intellectual scale.  Roles and identities are laid out for them.  Lore, then, is the product of this environment (and a dysfunctional family, but that&#039;s a different matter).  Not only does she have &quot;all the visible trappings of the rich and powerful&quot; (52), but she also has the knowledge that comes with managing her family&#039;s corporation.  In trying to meet all these social and familial expectations, Lore ultimately jeopardizes herself.  Even under the guise of Sal Bird, Lore must also meet a different set of expectations (though it is because her knowledge exceeds these expectations that she is able to help the water plant).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time Lore spends away from her family ultimately enables her take control of her own life.  &quot;Self-actualization,&quot; according to Thoreau, requires a rejection of material goods, which Lore definitely accomplishes when she expresses her desire to stay with Spanner instead of going home.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article we read, the author questions Lore&#039;s supposed progression throughout the novel.  Is her development truly progressive?  Even though it may seem regressive because she returns to her family, I don&#039;t think that everything she went through should be discredited.  While I agree that her character seems to fall flat at the end, I think that, in the beginning of the novel at least, there seems to be hope for her internal development.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex in Slow River.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/240</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel that the entire novel works to reconcile Lore with the incredibly intimate and damaging rape that occurred in her past. All her experiences outside of the protecting curtain of the Van de Oests functions to give her the perspective and independence from which she can understand and come to accept what happened to her. She must reconcile her own sexual attraction for women with the horrible emotional injury that was inflicted upon her by a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex, throughout the novel, works against this reconciliation. First, obviously, is the event (or series of events) that so damages Lore: Her rape by her mother, Katerine. &quot;She doesn&#039;t know how to describe it. Heavy like the end of everything&quot; (68). This is the fundamental event that makes all the future healing work necessary, and it is entirely sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Lore&#039;s early attempts at reconciliation are damaged, and probably do more harm than good. At the age of 13, &quot;her films fill with porn actors wearing her parents&#039; faces...As her parents become more distant to one another, Lore brings them flesh to flesh&quot; (135). Sexual desire has come early for her, and she needs to find a way to express it, to rationalize it in terms of the damage that has been done to her. And so she fixates on her parents. Though it is the natural choice, because of what has happened to her, it can only have made her psychological damage worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several other examples of how sex works against Lore&#039;s independence and rational thought. Among them: The scene in which Lore films her friends having sex while drugged, for monetary gain (196-7) and the continuous sex work that Lore and Spanner pursue to pay for the aphrodisiac (220, 262, etc). These events, always involving sex, always work against Lore. She cannot reconcile herself with the past when her perspective of sex continues to be corrupted by mixing it with money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important note: Sex between women in this novel always involves penetration, though that is not strictly necessary (235, 220, etc.). It is not the equal sharing of pleasure that it could be. Sex is inherently a violation in Slow River, I think with the purpose of emphasizing the damage that it has done to Lore. It seems that the only solution is abstinence. Lore&#039;s relationship with Magyar is very chaste and intellectual. It is based on their mutual respect, which is followed, instead of led, by physical attraction. Lore can only overcome the damage that has been done to her when she is able to feel this physical attraction in combination with a more abstract mental attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>dependence and self</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/238</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The theme of dependence is dominant from the start in Lore&#039;s relationship with Spanner. She arrives &quot;naked and nameless in the city.&quot; (5) When she first encounters Spanner, she is lying on the gorund, utterly helpless. Spanner nearly leaves her, but finally decides to help. Then, as Lore goes back to Spanner&#039;s home, she realizes that she &quot;needed this woman, Spanner; depended on her, in a way that was shocking.&quot; (11) For Lore, a child of privelege, confident in her education and her ability, this is a very difficult situation to accept. It is made even harder by the fact that she quickly finds herself in Spanner&#039;s debt, and forced to agree to join in her illegal activities in order to pay that debt. Her dependence is brought home to her by the fact that, while Spanner does ask her if she is willing, in reality she has no choice because she has nowhere else to turn.&lt;br /&gt;
    As Lore&#039;s relationship with Spanner continues, her dependence on Spanner for everything, from a place to hide to her goals and purpose every day begin to conflict with the individual she was before. Just before Spanner begins to teach her to steal, Lore meets Hyn and Zimmer, two fences. At first she doesn&#039;t know what to say, but then &quot;her early training, the endless meetings with local and national dignitaries, took over.&quot; (83) Then though, she is reminded of her dependence on Spanner, and she seems to draw away from her training. Subsequently, the two go out to steal slates, and Lore is taking her cues on what to say and how to act from Spanner. She listens to the other&#039;s stories, and uses her tactics. Her training is now essentially useless, and her dependent state causes her to develop, in a way, a new persona.&lt;br /&gt;
    Eventualy, Lore does make her way out from Spanner&#039;s shadow. This takes place over a period of time, and of course involves her finally getting a job and her own place to live, and all the steps she takes to pay Spanner back. However, I think the whole process may have begun somewhat earlier, in a surprising way. When Lore and Spanner go into the porn shop under their flat, we see for the first time Lore beginning to assert herself. While they are in the shop, she keeps making derogatory comments about the quality of the porn - &quot;I can do better than that;&quot; &quot;I was doing better work than this three years ago,&quot; (173) and so on. And Spanner responds. Lore&#039;s knowledge and ability have impressed her, and clearly given her the idea to have lore make better porn. Of course, at this time in the story Lore is still very much dependent on Spanner. However, by finally going back to something from her past, something of herself that is valuable and unique, she takes the first steps in psychologically freeing herself from that dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Rich people suck.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/237</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Slow River.  However, I also enjoy The Hills and America&#039;s Next Top Model, so this means very little.  I enjoyed it, but I didn&#039;t think it was particularly good.  The major issue I had with it was the apparent lack of a character arc for Lore.  As she is the protagonist, I assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with her; at least, I found no indication to the contrary.  I did not particularly like her, however, and there were some major flaws in her character that I thought needed more of a treatment than the book gave.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the story (chronologically), Lore is:&lt;br /&gt;
 a) mind-blowingly rich, and has all the easy naÃ¯ve carelessness of the aristocracy&lt;br /&gt;
b) mildly obsessed with sex&lt;br /&gt;
c) prideful and striving to prove herself to those around her (her family, the company)&lt;br /&gt;
d) unthinkingly supportive of the unfair and dangerous monopoly her family hold on the water purification system.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the novel, she is still all of these things.  She has apparently made the most progress in the &quot;mildly obsessed with sex&quot; category â€“ she has at least discovered love, to augment lust.  She has plenty of positive characteristics as well, obviously, but the above four were issues I expected to be addressed in her development that were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow River was unexpectedly pro-corporation.  The ethical dilemmas posed by the van de Oest monopoly on the genetically engineered water-purification system are obvious â€“ it allows blatantly artificial price inflation and the eradication of all competition.  None of the characters, besides the huddled masses in Venezuela, ever question the rightness of this.  We already went over this in class, so I will say no more; more interesting to me is the sense of entitlement and subtle arrogance that Lore displays throughout the book.  At her job on Hedon Road, she listens to her superiors speak with a condescending, critical air.  After nearly everything Hepple says as he gives her a tour the first day, she mentally disparages him with thoughts like, &quot;I had learned at age 12, from my uncle Willem, that in a properly run plant the average BOD should never be higher than two ppm, but I didn&#039;t say anything&quot; (30) and &quot;[Hepple was] a little tin god, lording it over his tiny domain.  He wouldn&#039;t have lasted more than a day on one of my projects&quot; (32).  In just these two statements, Lore reminds herself, and the reader, that as an adolescent she already knew better than Hepple, she is connected to the van de Oests, and if she was not in hiding, she would be in control of all her bosses&#039; fates.  With unthinking ease that comes with being of the super-elite, she places herself as superior to everyone else in the plant.  Even Magyar has to prove to Lore that she is not a complete idiot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore tells Magyar her true name, it is with a certain self-satisfied pride.  When Magyar reacts with anger, and not awe, Lore thinks, &quot;But I&#039;m Frances Lorien van de Oest!  Didn&#039;t she know what that meant?  She couldn&#039;t just dismiss me, as if I were anyone else...But she had.  Which is what I wanted, wasn&#039;t it - to be treated as a real person?&lt;br /&gt;
It is the closest Lore comes to self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finished reading, I found myself wondering if Lore&#039;s flat character was faulty writing or some kind of extraordinarily subtle criticism of the sheltered elite on Griffith&#039;s part.  I think that this is swerving dangerously close to trying to identify author&#039;s intent, so I will not attempt to answer that question; rather, I will only comment that Lore is quite an unusual character in a genre that is so often anti-establishment and subversive.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 7</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/236</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Slow River was very much like a case study of a person, a comprehensive analysis of that person&#039;s life and what happened to them that made them into the person that they currently are. Nicola Griffith, in my opinion, was able to make Lore a very interesting and complex character. She was able to accomplish this in part because of the differing narrative perspectives in the   novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     One of the most prominent aspects of Slow River is the constant switching of perspective, from third person when describing the past to first person when describing the present. At first, I was kind of annoyed at this but I gradually came to appreciate it. This switching of perspectives has a powerful impact on the story. It manages to reflect the internal conflict that Lore is experiencing â€“ she feels like she is completely detached from her past, as if her past self is a completely different entity. Numerous times throughout the novel, she questions who her true self while rejecting her past. In one memorable passage, she is sitting on a rooftop, reminiscing about major events throughout her lifetime, when she suddenly steps onto a ledge and contemplates what implications suicide might bring: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was finishing the fourth can, I realized I was standing at the          edge of the roof. My toes poked over the gutter. One more step. No more  Sal Bird, aged twenty-five. No more fear about being found out; no more worries about dangerous people coming looking for me or Spanner; no more responsibility, feeling like I was the thin human wall between an unsuspecting city and an accident waiting to happen. It could all just stop. Here. Now. After all, Frances Lorien van de Oest had died a long time ago. (Griffith, 100)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Lore reveals the anguish that her past brings her, and how it has disgusted her to the point where she completely rejects her old self. The retelling of Lore&#039;s past in third person reinforces this notion. Instead of Lore personally taking the reader through her past, we get a more objective, detached narrator which more accurately reveals the chasm between Lore&#039;s past and present. The differing perspectives give the novel two dramatically different tones and adds a great deal of complexity. When the novel switches to Lore&#039;s past and consequently the third person perspective, it seems like the reader is made to feel powerless, because we are observing from a distance and do not receive any of Lore&#039;s thoughts. In contrast, when the story changes to the present and we are brought back to the first person, Lore seems like an extremely competent and intelligent being and it feels like she is much more in control of her situation. Before, Lore was powerless and entirely subject to the whims of her environment; now, Lore is the smartest person at her work place and is constantly fighting against her environment rather than constantly giving in to it. Ultimately, I think this switching of perspectives is one of the more poignant aspects of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dealing with Vulnerability</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/235</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to tie together two issues we discussed briefly in class: Lore&#039;s seemingly overwhelming worry about being discovered and themes of environmentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her life with Spanner, Lore constantly worries about being recognized from the kidnappers&#039; videos: &quot;There was nothing specific of which she was afraid, just... everything, as though the world were a gelatinous beast that would fall upon her and suffocate her. The open spaces, the feeling that her back was naked, that people could see through her clothes, that someone would recognize her as the heiress who was kidnapped three or four months ago&quot; (86). Paragraphs of paranoid thoughts often culminate with worries that &quot;people might recognize her, might stare and point&quot; (57). Such behavior is understandable -- with the kidnapping and broadcasting of the videos, she went from an icon of premier social standing to an object of pity. Images of her in a weakened, suffering state flooded the market. According to a worldview where &quot;To look vulnerable was to be vulnerable&quot; (89),  being recognized from the pictures left Lore susceptible to more than just blackmail, but true emotional harm. She had internalized the image of the online photos -- the threatened and abused character in the kidnappers&#039; films is who she is, and she&#039;s afraid of others reconizing her, and in that recognition, confirming that identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emphasize the danger and power of this cycle, Lore has the model of Stella: &quot;To be used like a receptacle, a commodity, and to know it, to be helpless before it, and then to see that helplessness reflected back at her every time her eyes met her abuser&#039;s across the table, every time she saw herself in the mirror&quot; (292)... faced with such a situation, Lore understands why Stella chose to kill herself. Lore accepts this choice, and must prevent herself from being overhwelmed by shame from which she can never escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow River introduces two competing methods of dealing with this vulnerability. The first is a type of &#039;eat or be eaten&#039; mentality that drives Lore to reflect &quot;Everyone suffered. It was just a question of making sure she was using them, and not the other way around&quot; (85). Lore justifies seruptitiously videotaping her friends having sex with the rationale that they&#039;ve seen her in similar situations (197). In her relationship with Spanner, Lore learns how to manipulate her way into power, which parallels the tactics used by Greta and Katerine -- all of them focus on using others in order to avoid the conclusion that they were used and harmed by others. The alternative seems to be ecological. As Lore begins to tend her garden, she shows a strong departure from the previous mindset: &quot;Many of the weeds she left alone. They had fought to be there; she wasn&#039;t going to be the one to pull them out. Besides, they were green and growing&quot; (87). This respect for life, growth, and individual freedom contrasts sharply to the &#039;everyone is suffering, take what you can&#039; idea from before. As Lore continues to explore this new way of living, she begins to feel better about herself: instead of illicit activities that make her lips begin to curl like Spanner&#039;s (i.e. getting trapped into a cycle of hurt-or-be-hurt), she begins to recognize a need for &quot;wild things, natural things&quot; (113).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in exploring more about the satisfaction Lore finds in this new approach, as well as the seeming contrast between the &#039;natural&#039; and &#039;kill-or-be-killed&#039; lifestyle (isn&#039;t that how the animal world works?), but I&#039;m going to call it a night for now.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ain&#039;t no Cyberpunk</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/234</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It was pretty easy to expect, when I was first handed Lore as a trembling victim and Spanner as her fast-talking underworld coach, that the world of Slow River is a cyberpunk world in which one&#039;s identity implant is their life and loss of it turns one into a non-person. This isn&#039;t what Slow River is about at all. It&#039;s not cyberpunk at all, though aside from Neuromancer it&#039;s one of the few novels we&#039;ve run into that is set in a world not that much after our own, where space travel isn&#039;t an issue and earth and recognizable human technologies define the plane, scale and challenges of the novel.  Lore has never lost some widget of technology she couldn&#039;t regain. She doesn&#039;t glory in her life on the edge, and neither does the novel.  In fact, instead of being faced with the unknowability of the life and threat of the elite, we find her first with intimate knowledge of the world, rather than fighting desperately against it.  She chooses to hide from her former identity and her incredibly powerful family for other, far more tangled reasons, reasons that the story slowly peels back in layers. The psychological thickets underlying Lore&#039;s denial of her identity are the heart of a fascinating study of economic class, family secrets, friendship and loyalty, self-esteem, and self-created identity. This is not a cyberpunk identity thriller. Lore observes that she is a creature who has fallen from the tops of the jungle trees down into the lower layers of growth. What follows is simple, but an elegant metaphor in the body of the novel.  Each layer of the jungle is a different ecosystem; each has its own rules, its own predators, its own logic. Jungle creatures who fall out of their natural layer are completely unequipped for the world in which they find themselves, and often die miserable deaths. But the river that cuts through the center of the jungle also cuts through all of the layers, leaving open space where one can, if one chooses, see them all at once for what they are. It&#039;s a compelling metaphor for class and an interesting guide to Lore&#039;s emotional journey, and when Lore finds her emotional riverbank, the resonances echo back through the story and transform and improve the entire novel.&lt;br /&gt;
	Interestingly, the science in is water reclamation, and surprisingly, I find it riveting as presented by Griffith.  To be honest there is some passing reference to identity hacking, ransoming, and con games, but those bits of technology are indistinct supports for character and plot. Environmental engineering is the foregrounded science, and Lore&#039;s competence, dedication, and understanding makes it far from either boring or typically political. Not that it&#039;s NOT political. The politics here are about class, rather than purely about environmentalism, and even here the multinational corporation is more ambiguous than evil. Seen through Lore&#039;s eyes, the biological process of cleaning and recycling water takes on a complex, difficult beauty that had me looking forward to scenes of tromping about sewage treatment plants.  Go sewage rakes! Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;
	One thing I just have to mention about this book is how elegant the use of more-and-less subtle difference in P.O.V. is in this book.  Though confused along with the rest of you at being introduced to the same character at several different stages in her life, it allows you to move in and around the complex identity timeline of one person in a way that make me much more comfortable than any of the other books we&#039;ve read so far â€“ take, for example, Stars in my Pockets as an example of the opposite effect. As far as I have picked it apart, Slow River is told in three narrative strands with the same protagonist but separated in her life by time. The current story is told in the first person, the immediate background in tight third-person past tense, and Lore&#039;s childhood in a &quot;looser&quot; third-person present. Lore&#039;s childhood was a story told to her, her life with Spanner was a story pushed at her, and her life afterwards is the story she takes control of. It&#039;s that sort of book, full of parallels, symbolism, sideways approaches to questions of identity, and use of literary devices as cues.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Gray-haired Burden</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/233</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since it has not really been addressed yet, the question of race in Slow River is a very interesting one.  As someone else mentioned, the gender dynamic is a departure from what we have been reading because Griffith creates an arguably homonormative environment where Lore&#039;s life is inundated with lesbian friends and even an uncle with a husband, demonstrating the total acceptance of gay marriage in this society.  As far as race, it is not an issue in any of the main or love interest characters.  The character of Paolo and the parts of the narrative of Lore&#039;s past that set up his identification are the most notable admission of the existence of non-White individuals in the van de Oest world.  In other areas of the novel, countries are mentioned where the van de Oest family has projects going on, including local labor disputes and the outcry after the Caracas affair.  But as far as being a central theme of the book, race is simply not as important to Griffith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this is perhaps done on purpose by Griffith.  Since we see the story through Lore&#039;s eyes and are repeatedly reminded of how her family operates, it may be a way to demonstrate the non-existence of Other to the van de Oest family.  While Lore did her best to educate herself and read about the biological intricacies of the family business, anything so outlandish as ethics or anthropological studies seem to have been left out.  As far as the corporation is concerned, the people of Caracas are relatively inconsequential to the long lasting goals of their remediation projects, and more honestly, their goals of protecting their monopoly by creating dependent bugs.  This lack of concern for fellow human beings is especially apparent in the character of Greta, who sells, and essentially destroys, her sister&#039;s life in order to secure the financial future of a particular project which is only a part of the family&#039;s business.  This forces the reader to understand in no uncertain terms that the family has not sought to inspire a significant moral compass in their offspring, as the pursuit of morals and the pursuit of insane wealth rarely seem compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the idea of race in the book, one might also consider the more general pattern of identifying people based on physical characteristics.  Socially, we are trained to read certain traits and assign people labels, slip them into categories based on the shape of a nose, the color of skin, or the size and shape of eyes.  Interestingly, the labels and categories do vary depending on country, but it seems to be more of an overarching theme of human nature to label and categorize.  The idea of the gray hair as a new symbol of wealth was an interesting choice for Griffith and seemed to be her way of hammering home the arrangement of priorities for the van de Oest family.  In some ways they become their own race (or they have just excused themselves from being labeled along with anyone else).  They certainly have their own laws, codes of moral conduct, recognizable physical characteristic, and financial authority.  It seems after muddling through these ideas that, like issues of gender, race is not a theme in Slow River in the way we have been examining it in past books.  However, the point of the van de Oest family is that they have made themselves an island, and all those apart from the island are Other, which as a concept certainly lends itself to an analogy of White Americans against the rest of the (specifically non-Western) world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much identity!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/232</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I would agree with Moller when she says that to label this novel solely as a humanist work about the nature of human identity completely misses the novel&#039;s social and political ramifications, the exploration of identity is an interesting facet of the novel to explore.  It&#039;s also such an obvious part of the novel, that to ignore it is impossible.  Lore has three &quot;identities,&quot; as represented by the different tenses and perspectives, as we talked about in class.  Not only does each Lore&#039;s storyline end with a convenient climax, they also begin with a birth.  First, her original birth.  Then she arrives naked &quot;curled in a fetal position&quot; in a new city (5).  Then, she implants herself with a new identity.  But the overarching question remains, are these rebirths really new starts, or are they just the same Lore, but in a new environment?  I see the novel as presenting two pretty conflicting ideas of identity.  The first is that there is some sort of intrinsic identity, that who you are is static, even in the face of a changing environment.  At other times, the novel seems to suggest that your identity is based more on other people&#039;s perceptions of you than anything inherent within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Nature is a strong theme in the novel, more so than in a lot of the other novels we&#039;re read this semester. It is set soon enough in the future that wild things still exists, but far enough away that they are more precious, so when they do show up, they are significant.  Lore describes the trees dying in Spanner&#039;s apartment as strong, you can &quot;drench it in acid rain and infest it with parasites, carve initials in its bark and split branch from trunk, and it will survive&quot; (56).  External conditions don&#039;t wear down the tree, even under outside pressures, it keeps going.  Similarly, Lore continues to be Lore even with the outside pressure to be Sal Bird.  She wants to adopt Sal Bird&#039;s identity, say only the types of things Sal Bird would say, but because she &quot;couldn&#039;t bear to see a system fail due to simple ignorance&quot; she knowingly risks being found out (75).  There are certain aspects of herself that Lore simply cannot suppress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	At the same time, Lore is strongly affected by her interpersonal relationships.  With Spanner, she does some terrible things that she would not have done otherwise.  After a particularly bad night, she vomits in disgust at her actions and repeats &quot;It wasn&#039;t me, it wasn&#039;t meâ€¦&quot; (262).  She knows that her old self would be disgusted with what she does now somewhat willingly, as she admits to Spanner.  Also, Lore thoroughly discards her identity as a van de Oest after the kidnapping.  She dyes her hair, adopts an accent and discards her family as always having been different from her.  However, the moment someone besides Spanner learns that she is in fact a van de Oest, she falls back into old patterns.  She is a van de Oest. Magyar she said &quot;couldn&#039;t just dismiss me, as if I were anyone else&quot; (282).  So here, it seems Lore seems to be who other people think Lore is, rather than having an identity based on anything she creates herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I&#039;m not sure whether Griffith was trying to push one perspective or the other, though I&#039;m inclined to think that we are more outwardly determined than we would like to think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tank Girl was a trip, but this is my response to Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/231</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In Slow River, we are presented with a protagonist who is rarely who she says she is, yet always remains herself.  Frances Lorien van de Oest is the kidnapped heir to a multi-billion dollar company working as a grunt in a sanitation plant for little pay.  Nicola Griffith uses Slow River to present Identity as a two-fold concept, where one is defined by a legal classification, yet also by the set of morals and experiences they carry with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most pressing and recognized identity is of course the legal identity.  Present in the form of PIDAs, they are microcapsules implanted into the crook of the thumb and forefinger that are scanned for economic transactions, and detail the owner much in the same way as a license.  When Lore gains her new identity, she is given all the details with the PIDA: &quot;Bird, Sal.  Female.  Caucasian.  Blood type A positive.  DOBâ€¦ Twenty-fiveâ€¦The tiny black PIDA was in a sealed bag withâ€¦ a plaskin pouch the size of a pink cockroach.  Frozen blood for DNA tests,&quot; (21).  When Lore was still part of the van de Oest family, she had her own PIDA rather than that of a dead woman, and when kidnapped, the first thing to go was this legal identity.    By removing her PIDA, her kidnappers create a legal nobody, making it impossible for her to prove her identity on her own or access her family&#039;s resources.  Lore becomes a nobody, but at the same time can now be anybody simply by obtaining false temporary PIDAS, giving her a new sense for the world and for what an identity is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her reactions to experiences with Spanner of switching identities through various PIDAs, Lore shows her true inner identity, and comes to realize it is an inescapable, defining part of her.  While working as Sal Bird at the Hedon Road Plant, Lore is supposed to know little more than the most basic of procedures and functionings of the facility.  Yet when she recognizes issues with the operation, she can&#039;t help but remember things from her van de Oest past.  Magyar, her supervisor, tells her that the bacteria in the plant need to always be at 27.3oC, never anywhere else, yet Lore recognizes and almost speaks out to tell her, &quot;For a denitrification-nitrification process, heterotrophic facultative bacteria were usually comfortable anywhere between twenty-five and thirty degrees,&quot; but realizes in time that this is something Sal Bird would have no conception of (47).  In addition to the knowledge, though, Lore also retains some of her superiority complexes, as shown when she discovers that her family&#039;s nutrient products have been substituted with generics.   While the bacteria are most likely completely capable of surviving and functioning with the nutrients provided by the generic brand, Lore feels that the lives of millions of people are being put at grievous, unnecessary risk.  Yet the plant functions fine until an occurrence of deliberate sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lore&#039;s experiences through the novel help her to realize that there are two levels to identity.  The surface level that most people see is the legal and falsifiable persona, but the deeper, moral identity is something that cannot be recreated and invented so easily, as it is an accumulation of knowledge and experiences.  The two together serve to act as the real, present self, and at the end of the novel, Lore recognizes that finally she &quot;would be nobody but the Lore [she] had made,&quot; (343).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lore&#039;s dependency issues</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/230</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on &quot;Slow River,&quot; everyone is obviously interested in what the book has to say about identity.  Lore constantly struggles with her inability to ever truly inhabit one of her three characters.  &quot;I slept for nine hours and woke up feeling stiff and sore, as though my body had tried to rearrange itself physically to fit three people inside one skin. (294)&quot; The persona of Bird seems rather insignificant to me because while this is the PIDA Lore has adapted, she never really replaces Bird&#039;s place in the world.  The taking on of Bird&#039;s identity is a purely technical process.  Lore never actually becomes Bird in an emotional sense - she knows nothing of Bird&#039;s history in regards to family and relationships.  While in the work environment Lore does consider what Bird&#039;s actions would be, she never succeeds at suppressing her knowledge, as proven by Magyar&#039;s quick suspicions.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my reading, Lore is Lore of the van de Oest family, Spanner&#039;s Lore or Magyar&#039;s Lore.  Her personality and actions are dependent on the people who surround her.  When growing up with her family, Lore is always bending over backwards to please her parents.  Lore&#039;s desire for Katerine&#039;s approval is what drives her work ethic and ultimately blinds her to her mother&#039;s horrific behavior.  Lore&#039;s life goals were decided for her at birth and she has little say in the matter.  She is disgusted by Stella&#039;s rebellious ways and does not realize till it&#039;s too late that Stella was actually trying to define herself as a separate entity from her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Lore proves her strength and grit when she attacks her kidnapper and escapes.  But then Spanner takes her under her wing and forms Lore&#039;s new identity.  Lore takes on a life of crime and deceit.  At her worse moment, Lore is under the spell of not only Spanner, but also the drug that she consumes in order to tolerate the prostitution Spanner has forced her into.  While Lore continually feels shame for the acts she commits, she does not have the confidence in her own identity to break away from Spanner.  She loses respect for herself and eventually projects this onto Spanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore finally does leave Spanner, she quickly finds someone else to base her personality off of â€“ Magyar.  Lore&#039;s relationship with Magyar is a sharp contrast to her certainly dysfunctional relationship with Spanner.  While her time with Spanner was greatly defined by sex, Lore&#039;s connection with Magyar is much more rooted in emotions.  She tells Magyar, &quot;I&#039;ve never had any romance, ever.  But how could I?  I&#039;ve been so many people, I never knew which ones were real.  I want to find that out before you and Iâ€¦ before we go any further. (300)&quot; At this moment, Lore is expressing that she wants to recognize her true self before being defined by her bond with someone else.  Yet I doubt that she ever really does this.  Magyar is the one who forces Lore to face her demons and attempt to reconstruct her life by contacting her father.  Who knows if Lore would have ever found the motivation to call her father if it weren&#039;t for Magyar and Spanner.  I found the final sentence to be sweet but also disturbing.   After just reclaiming her identity as Francis Lorien van de Oest, Lore walks with Magyar and thinks, &quot;When I met my family again, I would introduce them to both of us. (343)&quot; Clearly, Magyar is a positive force in Lore&#039;s life but what happened to her claim that she was going to find herself before progressing the relationship?  Shouting out your name does not mean you know yourself.  The fact that she wants to reconnect with her family with Magyar by her side implies that she has not really discovered herself.  Rather, she is still depending on a stronger partner to carry her through life&#039;s discomforts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bicurious?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/229</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;so, I&#039;m in the middle of Tank Girl right now. (current judgment=awesome.)&lt;br /&gt;
One totally random thought that has occurred to me: why are the powerful, liberated and sexually liberated women in movies always kissing each other?  Tank Girl makes out with Jet Girl to help her out of a sticky situation, though she has a boyfriend/partner at the start of the film, so she&#039;s not off-limits to men.  My question: is this an indication of their freedom from the proper social constructions of gender and heterosexuality, or is it just another male fantasy to augment the eroticization of powerful women?  If one adheres to Laura Mulvey&#039;s theory that all film is conplicit with the male gaze, the answer would be the latter, but I&#039;m not sure I do agree with her.  Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Slow River and the long-range privatization of biotechnology</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/228</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed by Slow River&#039;s depiction of the near-future applications, and consequences, of developing biotechnology and nanotechnology. The novel uses accurate, technical terminology to create a sense of reality; even for those readers who are not familiar with the technology Griffith is discussing, her faculty with it is obvious and lends authenticity to the novel. Furthermore, it is this background of science and its economics which makes the novel more than a simple, plot-driven work of fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
The novel brings up the fundamental issue of corporate involvement in the development and application of new technology. Up until very recently, most biotechnological and nanotechnological research has been conducted in academic settings; however, these settings have rarely proven broadly effective in developing useful, large-scale applications of these technologies. However, the recent involvement of large amounts of private funding has spurred rapid advances in certain areas of bio- and nanoengineering.&lt;br /&gt;
Slow River takes this trend to the extreme: catastrophic environmental failure on a world-wide scale has spurred the growth of powerful, private biotechnology firms, such as that of the van de Ouests.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is where one of the basic conflicts of the novel&#039;s setting becomes clear; it is implicit that without the privatization of bioremediation technology, and subsequent dominance of the relevant social services by these private firms, the technologies would never have been developed in the first place--or at least, not to its (in the novel) incredibly sophisticated level. Without these private firms, the necessary improvements in water quality, air quality, waste reclamation and so forth would not have occurred in the first place. However, this privatization has also created its own problem; the profit motive, while extremely effective at encouraging innovation, also creates ethical conflict. Those in charge of or dependent on the corporations which provide these social services are on some level obligated to serve the corporation, to maximize its profitability and influence; however, this is often directly at odds with worker safety, social safety and, at its largest scale, civic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>gender in slow river</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/226</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the topics we didn&#039;t discuss in class yet about Slow River, interestingly enough, is gender relations. Perhaps because the majority of the characters are female, this is not as obvious an issue as in earlier novels we&#039;ve read; most of the character interaction is between women, in effect denying the gender discussion. In this, however, Griffith makes the gender discussion simply different, rather than obsolete. The first obvious difference is the fact that the child abuser, the perpetrator of incest, is the mother of the family, not the father. It is a different twist that this is actually closer to the &quot;Oedipal form&quot; of the family than the norm; while we see the potential for incest, it is absolutely startling to imagine the female parent as the one abusing her power and her children, though in the original story, it is of course the mother and son who commit incest. What are the implications of this surprise? For one, it destroys the image of the perfect mother, the caring and nurturing soul that all women must be. While this is certainly not a positive image of woman, because it contrasts a stereotype it can still be considered useful in helping society change the way it perceives the genders. Further, sexual abuse is usually more about the power involved than the actual sexual act (though it can probably be assumed the perpetrator does derive pleasure from the act), once again going against the female stereotype. It is not the father in Lore&#039;s family who has the power, it is the mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one could argue that because the non-stereotypical ideas are portrayed by a rather negative character, Griffith shows women who act beyond &quot;their place&quot; are all bad. I don&#039;t see this as true, however, because while the main evil originates in female characters, so does the main good. Griffith is simply showing two things: women can be any sort of individual, rather than be fit into long-perpetrated ideals of delicacy and kindness; also, conversely, that good people and bad can be of any gender. Another thing we must realize, however, is that the nearly female world she created is not the complete world, and the real world has not yet thrown out the old ideas. When Lore attempts to team with Paolo against the corrupt Hepple, Paolo shouts, &quot; &#039;I don&#039;t need a woman to fight my battles!&#039; &quot; (172). Paolo can&#039;t accept the idea that Lore may be able to help him because she has more knowledge and confidence. To him, all that matters is that she is female, and that it is somehow disgraceful to elicit help from a woman. Lore is utterly shocked at his response, and understandably so: she has the means and the desire to help, but is refused on a rather trite condition. While the following quotation is not specifically about gender relations, it can be tied to them: &quot;I wondered how many more centuries it would take to break the physically-stronger-equals-morally-superior equation . . .&quot; (259). Historically, this has been a gender issue; men naturally have more muscle than women, which has determined much of how the world operates. In the modern era, however, physical strength means very little compared to strength of intellect, and yet those of better physical strength assume superiority. Lore quickly dismisses her thought rather cynically, assuming that humanity will, indeed, never change. This doesn&#039;t give us much hope for gender relations either, unless the intelligent weak(er) can somehow reach the assuming buff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note about relationships in general, it was interesting to read a novel in which all sexual encounters are between women. Not only do they happen rather frequently, but it is generally unusual and quite unheard of in our previous novels. The only vaguely heterosexual encounter is Lore&#039;s porn video of her parents, which was completely made up, as if she was trying to find some way such a relation could work. Also interestingly, the only scenes that occur in first person are between Lore and Magyar. This seems to suggest by the first person narrative either that finding someone who actually would love her helped Lore understand her identity, or the opposite: that in finding her identity, she found love.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Social Justice</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/225</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed today in class that the issue of excessive wealth hit some nerves on both the social justice and economist side of the thought spectrum.  Some people were offended by the notion that someone who works just as hard as an executive (or some other high earner) could be living in squalor while that single executive could have so much money that he doesn&#039;t know what to do with it.  Others seemed offended by the thought that people could hold that executive in contempt for earning so much money.  I just want to add my two cents.  I&#039;ve always wondered what compels someone who already has enough money to make it so that he&#039;ll never be want for anything ever again, to make more money.  For example, David Beckham went to L.A. for more money, but how is that going to improve his life?  Isn&#039;t the camaraderie of his own nation worth more to him personally than some article about the 12 wealthiest athletes or something?  Yet, I meet so many people who see it as completely natural for someone to make a decision like that.  All I can say is that there is something fundamentally flawed with the decisions people with lots of money make.  I don&#039;t know why it is.  I could guess that since they&#039;ve been successfully making decisions to increase their wealth all their life, that&#039;s the only kind of decision they know how to make, but that would be a gross generalization, and is rather simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Slow River - First Reactions.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/224</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So my first reaction on finishing Slow River: &quot;What? That&#039;s it?!?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few things that prompted that reaction. First, I didn&#039;t feel like Griffith really pulled off the conspiracy with Greta very well. There was only the mention that she &quot;had to have secret power&quot; there at the end, and that she had been perverted by Katerine to explain any of her conniving and plotting. The secret conspirator at the plant was not very interesting, basically since we never really met him or knew anything about him.&lt;br /&gt;
Second, I felt like Lore returned to the arms of her father far too readily, with nothing but a few scolding &quot;Oh Papa&quot;&#039;s to let us know she&#039;s angry. There should be a lot more that she has to deal with before she can resolve such deep issues.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I thought the union between Lore and Magyar, while kind of inevitable, didn&#039;t have any real charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, I did enjoy the book quite a bit. The world that Griffith creates, in which companies compete for huge governmental contracts to clean up our mess, seems to be plausible to me. At least, I can&#039;t imagine a more likely scenario in which the human race will clean up the earth. There will be corruption and greed in any such large undertaking, no matter how noble the overall motives.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I liked the intricacy of the three plots that Griffith wove around each other, and the depth with which she constructed Lore and Spanner, especially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to note that the only heterosexual couple mentioned in the novel (as far as I could tell) were Oster and Katerine, who were pretty much as screwed-up as they could be. That&#039;s not to say that Spanner and Lore&#039;s relationship was any good, but I thought it was interesting that heterosexual relationships made such a small appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-CZ&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Structure/POV/tense of Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/223</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing that I noticed about Nicola Griffith&#039;s Slow River was the variance in storytelling styles. Not only are there three different storylines ( Lore&#039;s life with Spanner, her work at the purification plant, her childhood flashbacks ), but they are told in three different ways ( third person past-tense, first person past-tense, third-person present-tense ).  It was incredibly jarring for me at first, as it went against everything grammar school had taught me about sticking to one style of narration and one time frame. It&#039;s still a bit odd, but I&#039;ve been able to work through what Griffith was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-person past-tense from Lore&#039;s personal life is narration designed to make Lore seem alienated and out-of-place, even from herself; we do not get her POV directly, because she is not the center of this universe. She comes in destitute, is taken in by Spanner, and put into a life far different than the privilege she is used to. Her relationship with the cynical, morally ambiguous Spanner is of a very tenuous nature, and she is very ambivalent to the illicit activities she gets involved in. Even though Lore and Spanner are very intimate physically, the narration style seems to indicate an obvious disconnect between action and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-person present-tense from the flashbacks seems to indicate the same sort of alienation, but the shift in tense indicates the importance of her memory; for Lore, her formative years and trauma are not just recordings from the past, but something so important and visceral that it permeates the rest of her life. Like they say, some memories are so vivid that they seem like they just happened yesterday; with Lore&#039;s tragic backstory, this would be very appropriate. The third-person POV continues to keep it alienated from her, though also from us; I can see how getting a blow-by-blow recount from Lore as things like the kidnapping are happening to her would be too painful to read, and for that matter, even harder for Griffith to write without slipping into melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-person accounts from Lore&#039;s job as Sal Bird are a bit harder for me to get my head around. I can see how the fact that Lore develops her own agency in the field of biological science helps put the spotlight back on her, as she goes from being a spectator to an active player. However, it still seems like Lore has to accept that there is only so little that she can do in her position; she&#039;s still the same person as she is at home with Spanner, even if she is more in her element. It almost seems unnecessary, because while we hear about Lore&#039;s feelings in both of the present-continuity storylines, only the POV makes a difference. And there, it&#039;s just the semantics of wordplay.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>post-humanity and philosophy</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/221</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So.  There is a comic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bohemiandrive.com/&quot;&gt; bohemian drive,&lt;/a&gt; which looks at the solar system after the last human has died (peacefully) and robots inhabit the nine planets, various moons, and asteroids.  The structure of the pages within the site is a bit odd, don&#039;t expect it to update anytime soon, but it&#039;s only 75 episodes, so finite procrastination, and it&#039;s an interesting society that is created.  Also interesting commentary on humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also links to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askphilosophers.org/&quot;&gt;ask philosophers&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses many questions that we&#039;ve dealt with, sometimes peripherally, in class.  I don&#039;t necessarily agree with what they say, but it&#039;s well-articulated food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gattaca</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/220</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gattaca is a difficult and interesting movie. I find my feelings about its subject matter to be very much split between the positive and negative; while genetic manipulation provides great advances and has considerable potential, the movie makes clear the potential cost as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two potential benefits of genetic engineering which the movie touches on seem of particular interest to me. The first is the relatively obvious one: reversal of our genetic stagnation. As our medical sciences have advanced, our ability to keep people alive and reproductively sound--despite genetic or physiological flaws which would have otherwise precluded survival--has increased. While this is undeniably a good thing, it has the unfortunate side effect of having effectively stopped our species ability to move forward on a genetic level. Genetic engineering circumvents this problem; Darwinism becomes artificial and consciously driven, but is at least reintroduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interesting side-effect of large scale genetic manipulation of humanity--and an attendant public knowledge about the basic realities of genetics--is that it renders the race issue essentially moot. Genetic differentiation between races today is essentially negligible anyways; what becomes important in society is not superficial differences, but quantifiable genetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the artificial Darwinism introduced by the movie; while in the long run it will be beneficial to the species, it is the inherent model of Darwinism, that few are winners and many are losers, so to speak, that is the cause of our protagonist&#039;s troubles. The fundamental question raised by the movie, for which I have no answer, is this: our species must change in order to move forward and survive. How many is it acceptable to sacrifice along the way?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gattaca......?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/219</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#039;m missing something, but I haven&#039;t seen any topics about Gattaca so far...and its a bit hard to find individual comments about it when there is no tag for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve watched it three times now....twice in the past, and once this week....and I personally find the movie quite engaging to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a particular reason I&#039;m not seeing much discussion for it?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Where the danger lies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/217</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After class yesterday, I realized that a lot of discomfort with Cyteen&#039;s universe comes from the fact that individuals&#039; futures, to some degree, seem to be determined by forces outside their power.  This outside force appears in the form of tape, genetic manipulation, and environmental manipulation, as with Ari.  However, despite this level of control, and despite the disturbing subservience of the azi, the technology of tape and genetic manipulation doesn&#039;t really scare me on principle.  What scares me in this is the culturally developed belief that behavior is deterministic.  It is this belief that presents a society which appears so sinister.  The tape is useful, and yields a more competent, but the mentality of control causes simply sad situations, such as Jane leaving, to turn into scary ones.  For Nelly, instead of letting the grief of loss reshape her personality, as would happen in our society, they find it necessary to reprogram her to handle the loss, because to do otherwise would be to lose a valuable asset.  What is really being done to Nelly isn&#039;t really healing at all.  It is merely reestablishing the control which the society has over her.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cyteen response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/216</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did enjoy Cyteen for the story and the characters, particularly in the development of the second Ariane.  However, much of the politics and the verbal sparring went over my head, and I fear this was a significant portion of the novel.  All of the different alliances and enmities between the major political influences in the novel seemed to change so fast, and often to cues that I as a reader did not pick up for several pages after.  The only point that remained constant was Mikhail&#039;s dislike of both the young and old Ariane, and the need for everyone, everywhere, to watch what he or she says for fear of eavesdroppers.  I would have liked more discussion on the sides for and against the system that includes all of the genetic manipulation and the purpose of the &#039;azi.&#039;  I think the Abolitionists were the major party against this, but I may be wrong.  I guess with the severely limited starting population of a planet, some gene manipulation would have to occur to stop proliferation of genetic diseases and weaknesses, but I was surprised that this was not important to many of the characters of the novel.  It appeared that the people had largely just accepted the changes and experiments, as long as the result was human.  I have trouble believing the lack of controversy here.  I guess the secrecy of the grander experiments done by Ariane and the other top researchers may have helped hide this from the public, but I just don&#039;t think the population would accept this system.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, all this small starting population (meaning limited and often unified viewpoints) and the introduction of the &#039;tapes&#039; seems to have created a society in which this is the norm.  The tapes themselves are also controversial, both the tranquilizings needed to view the tapes and the level on which many of them affect the recipient.  While the ability to learn and remember something very quickly and painlessly would be great, I am surprised that there has been no sabotage.  The talk of a tape &#039;worm&#039; interspersed in the novel introduces the idea of some latent danger from the tapes, but with the way they can affect the most basic logic of human consciousness, I would think there would have been some kind of terrorist or conspiracy attempt by those in control.  On a similar note the azi, particularly Caitlin and Florian, have very little say in what they do, and constantly strive to make their master(s) happy. Perhaps this takeover has already occurred through selective breeding and tape inundation, but in such a way and on a scale as to make acceptable to the public as well.  I would think that some kind of artificial intelligence could do many of the jobs just as well as the azi, while not being requiring all of the birthing and raising process.  A society that has faster-than-light travel should be able to manage this.  There is so much of this absolute control over human life, with cloning, breeding, and rejuve, and it strikes me as odd that there has been so little effort to create trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Azi Musings</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/215</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this novel was absurdly huge, straight up finishing over break was more important than annotating at the time, unfortunately, but here it goes.&lt;br /&gt;
There were lots of interesting facets to this novel, which made getting through it a lot easier, but one of the most interesting parts was the Azi.  Cherryh never really explains the process of their creation.  We get small snippets over the course of the novel, and can piece together some sort of idea of how they&#039;re made.  We learn that they were initially created as filler for too-empty populations, to stimulate economic growth.  There were insufficient adults to give the children they needed individual attention, so Resune developed tape-learning, and raised the Azi synthetically instead.  They were a solution to a problem initially, a sort of ready-made human, but I didn&#039;t get the feeling that, at least originally, they were anything like slaves.&lt;br /&gt;
Tape learning teaches incredibly specific skills, like penmanship and horseback riding, so that method of teaching allowed for the creation of incredibly specific behaviors. Such incredible specificity led to the creation of azi to fill specific roles, rather than general bodies capable of stimulating the economy.  The &quot;batches&quot; of azi are defined by their genesets, and have tape designed specifically for each geneset.  These batches range from the Rho-class which has an &quot;Rezner [score of] 45 and below&quot; and an &quot;ability to rebound from mishandling and bad tape&quot; and is used for experimentation and general labor, to the alphas which score upward from 150 on the Rezner scale and are generated &quot;only rarely except for specific executive assignments&quot; (29-30).  Thus we have selective breeding, as never before seen by humans, performed on humans.  The creation of individuals for specific societal roles is not exactly slavery, but it certainly causes some problems with free will.  The reasearchers in charge of the tape program reward systems into the azi.  Justin&#039;s pet project is changing these systems so that the azi get pleasure directly from the work that the programmers choose that the azi should do.  This really seems to be absurdly specific selective breeding.  In the initial world-setting stage of the book an educational publication states, &quot;AGCULT-789X, experimental as the X-designation indicates, closely resembles the RYX-20s or the EU-4561s, except that the genetic codes of the RYX-20s and the EU-4561s indicate two feet while that of AGCULT-789X indicates for, and the RYX-20&#039;s and the EU-4651&#039;s codes indicate smooth skin, while AGCULT-789X&#039;s indicates a sleek bay hide and a superlative ability to run&quot; (31).  The RYX-20s and EU4561s are azi and the AGCULT-789X are horses, the only difference between the azi and the livestock are number of legs, hide type, and speed.&lt;br /&gt;
As disturbing as this all seems however, the azi certainly aren&#039;t unhappy with their programming, and they understand that they are programmed.  There are benefits to being an azi.  Since they&#039;re programmed for whatever function they perform, they are, generally speaking, impeccable in their performance.  All the security in the novel are azi because no one would prefer human body guard with slow reaction times when they could have Catlin instead.  And born-men have their own problems.  &quot;Excited born-men go to alternate programming sets. Every born-man is a schiz,&quot; Grant says, &quot;And he hates his alter ego&quot; (240).  Grant even says that he prefers his &quot;natural&quot; psychset (240).&lt;br /&gt;
The problem I think, is being an azi in a born-men world.  Azi are superior to born-men in many ways, but the born-men take them for granted.  At one point Grant gets incredibly frustrated with the born-men (including Justin) for not listening to an azi&#039;s point of view &quot;There&#039;s listening and listening,&quot; he says &quot;They&#039;ll always listen to me, when they won&#039;t, you.  But they won&#039;t listen to me the way they do you.  No more than they do Willâ€¦ they won&#039;t take his word&quot; and its because he&#039;s an azi (429).   That attitude of the born men is not only unfair, its stupid.  Grant points out at the beginning of the novel that azi and born-men have their strengths and weaknesses.  The azi take in every detail, weed out inconsistencies, which is why they can quickly process certain problems that the born-men can&#039;t even hold in their head.  He explains to Justin that as a born-man &quot;you&#039;re better at averaging shades than you are at remembering what really happened, that&#039;s how you can process things that come at you fast and from all sides.  And that&#039;s what we&#039;re worst at&quot; (154).&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though azi are treated like second-class citizens, or even livestock, they aren&#039;t inferior to the men who create them, they are better in certain respects.  And they&#039;re happy being azi, when born-men don&#039;t get in the way.  So it doesn&#039;t really seem necessarily bad to be an azi.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New plateau of advertising?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/213</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;An updated adage for the post-political age: Ask not what your commodity can do for you, but what you can do for your commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEw1rsBUak&quot; title=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEw1rsBUak&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEw1rsBUak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this car, the commodity-consumer relationship has entirely inverted. It is no longer the commodity that provides for me; rather, the commodity-object requires that I provide for it. Of course, the tit-for-tat  contractuality of bourgeois social relations remains in tact (you please the car, and it will please you), but the point stands: the onus lies, fundamentally, with the consumer to &quot;make the first move,&quot; as it were. Will I ever be able to take it to enough high-end stores and dinner parties to please it? Or, maybe it&#039;s sheer lust. Maybe all I have to do is perform well -- but which combination of gas-peddle manipulations would comprise good performance? Yet it&#039;s precisely this tension that sells the product. Here, we have the fetishistic gap between flesh-and-blood materiality and symbolic overcoding taken to new, absurd extremes&quot;: Who knows just how the car might please you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyborgian aspects of this ad seem germane to various course themes. It&#039;s notable, to begin with, that Cadillac decided to gender the prototypic consumer-subject of this car feminine rather than masculine, since -- assuming heteronormative standards of advertising  (more than a safe assumption, I think, given the source) -- this implicitly genders the car masculine. Although this gender scheme might feel intuitively felicitious (after all, aren&#039;t cars usually depicted as hyper-maculine power incarnate?), it actually runs contrary to the majority of such advertisements, which, insofar as they represent a sexualized bond between car and driver, tend to relegate the machine to a feminine position in which material passivity is coupled with libidinal activity -- a position of docile desire, the embodied occupant of which is mechanized and metalized. I would hardly be the first to suggest that this epitomizes male fantasy -- not so much pure sexual desire, but the more important, meta-level desire to surmount feminine desire, that impossible object-thing par excellence. On this reading, figures like Molly from Neuromancer literalize male fantasy: a cyborgified female subject whose desire has become -- like all machines -- codifiable and traversable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does it mean to invert the gender matrix, to have the female subject be the one in control, attemping to surmount the mystery of masculinized desire? Perhaps it relates to what Zizek calls &quot;interpassivity&quot; -- the inverse of interactivity (in which I get enjoyment from somebody else pursuing an activity in my place [e.g., when James Bond takes out the bad guy and gets the girl]). In an interpassive dynamic, I get enjoyment from someone else being passive in my place, the most immediately relevant example of which is probably canned laughter on sitcoms, which effectively make it unnecessary for me to even laugh at the &quot;humorous&quot; show I&#039;m watching -- there&#039;s already somebody laughing at it for me. Could we read an interpassive dynamic into the Cadillac scenario as well? What a relief: I&lt;br /&gt;
(the male viewer-subject) don&#039;t have to enjoy being serviced, since the car effectively fills that symbolic burden for me. And furthermore, I don&#039;t have to come to terms with the trauma of masochistic fantasy -- I can keep performing masculinity in the same way, business-as-usual, never having to question the reproduction of patriarchal conditions...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Race in Cyteen</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/212</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, race in Cyteen seemed to be of absolutely minimal importance.  Surface physical differences deteriorated (or evolved) into genetic ones: the most blatant division within Resuene society is the dichotomy of CIT and azi.  However, I find myself wondering if that division is not just a displacement of race issues.  The azi certainly seem to be the inferior members of this hierarchical structure.  Although they have an important function within the society and do not seem to mind their lower status, they are forced to be servants of the upper strata of CIT&#039;s.  The most constant reminder of this is Caitlin and Florian&#039;s inability (or refusal) to call Ari anything but &quot;Sera,&quot; an honorary term.&lt;br /&gt;
There is also a degree of segregation within the Resuene world: the azi all live down in the &quot;Town,&quot; in barracks separate from the CIT&#039;s whom they serve.  Unless the azi have been chosen to be special servants for a CIT, they live within this segregated world.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, there is another degree of segregation within the azi world--the division of them into alphabetical and intellectual classes.  This division, strikingly similar to Brave New World, offers up another look into segregation within Cyteen.  Maybe it all just ties into what the Oankali think--humans are inherently hierarchical... :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 6</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/211</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing the literary behemoth that is Cyteen, I still cannot help but be a little bit confused about certain aspects of the novel.  Although Cherryh does her best to explain all of the details of her world, it seems impossible to ever fully grasp everything that happens within Resuene.  Although I enjoyed the book, I felt pretty much clueless at the end of 680 pages.  One of its most confusing aspects is the fact that the entire civilization is split into two fundamental groups: the azi and the CIT&#039;s.  Obviously, there are surface differences, and Cherryh drops hints about these throughout the novel.  However, she also intentionally muddles her readers&#039; understanding about the two groups.&lt;br /&gt;
	Because Cyteen is so epic, the number of characters within its pages offer up many perspectives on the CIT-azi conflict.  The most obvious pairing of CIT and azi is Justin and Grant, who originally act as the perfect dichotomy within the society.  Upon their first introduction, Cherryh makes sure to note the most important difference between them: &quot;a replicate citizen was not azi.  There were considerable legal differences between young Justin, say, and elegant, red-haired Grant, at the second of tables, so, so close in all respectsâ€¦born in the same lab, an insignificant day apart&quot; (Cherryh 38).  For all of their similarities, the two characters are really not alike at all, simply because of the nurturing differences in their upbringings: &quot;one infant had gone to a father&#039;s armsâ€¦the other had gone to a crib where human heartbeat gave way at intervals to a soothing voice, where activity was monitored, crying measured, reactions clocked and timed--then extensive tape and training for three yearsâ€¦&quot; (Cherryh 39).  The difference seems to lie, not in their births, but in the all-important tape that pervades every aspect of life on Cyteen.  Cherryh never seems to find it important to explain exactly what it is, although she gives numerous examples of what it can do.  Although it certainly seems to have biological components such as those that enable a young boy to improve his penmanship, it also seems to work on moods and can even cause death, as in the case of &quot;Final tape&quot; (Cherryh 651).  No matter its exact physical components, tape is certainly at the fundamental center of the creation and indoctrination of the azi.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, azi creation only leads me to ask numerous other questions about them: primarily, are they slaves?  They do not seem to have any control over their assignments: Caitlin and Florian could not even choose their own partners or their own jobs.  Instead, they are genetically engineered to fit into certain professions. The title of the Abolitionists party also implies that at least some members of the Cyteen society believe that azi can be directly compared to slaves.  However, is it possible to make a slave out of something that does not have the same emotions as a human? Are they even human? Constantly, Cherryh reminds her readers that azi and CIT&#039;s are not the same.  Grant, in particular, is fond of differentiating between his own logic and the &quot;CIT kind of feeling&quot; that he gets at times (Cherryh 554).  Azi do not seem particularly unhappy with their lots; in fact, they seem to enjoy  mocking CIT&#039;s for their inability to &quot;[know] what&#039;s right and sane&quot; (Cherryh 429).  However, I find my own inability to know what&#039;s right tested by the meager differences between Grant and Justin.  Cherryh obviously intends to make this test--there are none of the noticeable changes between the diction of Grant-narrated and Justin-narrated passages that are present in those of young Ari.  Instead, their language seems strikingly similar, causing yet another question about how different the azi and CIT&#039;s really are.&lt;br /&gt;
	If they are fundamentally similar, I cannot help but shirk away from their treatment within Resuene society.  The original Caitlin and Florian&#039;s deaths remind me of the K-9 dogs of Starship Troopers that were put to death because the loss of their masters was simply too hard.  Abban is also unable to refuse his late master&#039;s orders, even though they brought about his own death.  Although the Abolitionists were not presented in the most favorable lights, I found myself often leaning towards their side on the issue of the azi--their status in Resuene seemed to be little more than glorified genetic slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Disgruntled technocrats</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/210</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two Oxford sociologists recently published a study concluding that engineers are more disposed than other professional demographic to join militant political groups (or, neocon parlance, &quot;terrorist groups&quot;). The finding itself--the empirical fact that rank-and-file terrorists are demonstrably likely to come from an engineering background of some kind--is less interesting than the analysis offered by the researchers to explain it (away). They express legitimate bafflement that members of the professional-technocratic class would come to oppose, much less militantly oppose, a global capitalism from which they directly benefit. Underlying this bafflement, however, is deeper incredulity: the researchers are clearly amazed--and why shouldn&#039;t they be, in this age of neoliberalism?--that members of the professional-technocratic class would become politicized at all. Indeed, when the researchers explicitly assimilate terrorism to &quot;right-wing politics&quot; (citing, as their analytical justification, the tendency of Rightism to reduce complex problems down to unwavering, univocal solutions), they are effectively claiming that politics is itself an inherently right-wing impulse--for what is a properly &quot;political&quot; act in our post-political age, if not an intervention that eshews &quot;live and let live&quot; ideologies outright, and instead takes an unwavering (to the point of downright &quot;unreasonable&quot;) stance? In this sense, &quot;politics&quot; (right-wing or otherwise) stands in direct opposition to the reproduction of technocratic power, which seems hell-bent on purging us of any inclination to take an unwavering, principled stance on just about anything. The most disastrous moment imaginable for neoliberal hegemony is when people--of whatever class or occupation--begin to mount viable opposition to the flexible, self-revolutionizing logic of Capital. Perhaps this offers some insight into the real threat of engineer-terrorists (that is, beyond the usual, banal anxieties of political militancy [They could harm innocent civilians! and the like] spoon-fed to us by mainstream media): they are the disgruntled by-product of a regime of technocratic power that seeks to erase disgruntlement altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with science fiction? Well, lots--at least to the extent that science-fictional visions of society attempt to understand the (usually rather horrific) results of down-to-earth, democratic humanism being supplanted by impersonal, unwieldy technologies of knowledge production and social control. In Neuromancer, Gibson talked briefly about locales that exist (or more pointedly, are ALLOWED to exist) to facilitate pure innovation--spaces in which the sole organizing principle of social life is Technology itself, that ubiquitous, self-permuting force that one either keeps up with or gets ruthlessly subsumed by. This seems to be a widely deployed trope in sci-fi, particularly those narratives concerned (allegorically) with our impending future. The Terminator films, for instance, envision America reduced to an apocalyptic simulacrum: all that&#039;s left of postmodern society is--what else?--the military-industrial complex, mega-corporations on the cutting age of technological innovation (which is, of course, responsible for the greatest tragedy to befall humanity in the history of the world). But wait: Where are the traditional loci of institutional authority--politicians, police, bureaucrats, etc.? In Freedman&#039;s paper from the beginnng of the course, he talked about the scene, from T2, of Arnold&#039;s aesthetically celebrated manhandling of police officers, in which we bear witness to the ecstatic destruction of human bodies (particularly pathetic human bodies), disturbing because of its obvious contempt for materiality, but also, and furthermore, because it underscores the disquietedly anarchic conditions of the film&#039;s landscape: police (as the emblem of the rule of Law) are no match for the scourge of capitalism and its volatile bedfellow, Technology. Indeed, it&#039;s worth noting that one of the only instances of traditional authority exercising any real power comes in Sarah&#039;s detention in a mental institution during T2. How perfect: the designation and quarantining of &quot;madness&quot;--the merciless intersection of knowledge production and social control.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet is this landscape really so allegorical? The films are by now somewhat dated (Terminator was released in 1984, Terminator 2 in 1991), but conditions of technocrat power, in which social life has acceded to the mandates to an out-of-control military-industrial complex (which arguably includes not only direct defense spending, but also many high-tech firms, the entertainment industry, and even some forms of scholarship [Middle East studies, anyone?]), have only intensified. It is difficult, for instance, to follow the 2008 election without it bringing to mind Terminator-style destruction of the impotent Law. What use is any politician in the face of transnational Capital--especially when all &quot;reasonable&quot; politicians refuse to question the merits of capitalism in the first place. Indeed, when Obama--to take one, rather arbitrary (though not entirely arbitrary, in light of his lovely rhetoric about &quot;hope and &quot;change&quot;) example--talks about returning power to the people, the proper response is, of course, to sigh, and wonder what&#039;s wrong with a nation in which fetishized politician-objects have come to not only replace, but actually occlude, structural analysis. What&#039;s crucial to realize w/r/t electoral politics is the sinister complementariy between larger-than-life promises (&quot;A new era of bi-partisanship&quot; / &quot;A new role for America in the world&quot; / etc.) and the one-part ridiculous, two-parts offensive  pandering stints in which politicians return to the people and try their hand at &quot;real&quot; work (e.g., when John McCain puts on a hard-hat and visits some construction workers, or Hillary Clinton helps out at a daycare [humorous sidenote to my polemic: imagine John McCain helping out at a daycare]). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So vast are the vissicitudes of ideological absurdity here, it&#039;s hard to know where to start. Consider Slavoj Zizek&#039;s remarks on Stalinism, in which he discusses the fundamental impotence at the heart of self-aggrandizing measures (e.g., parades and the like), and ultimately claims that an &quot;implicit acknowledgement of impotence is [actually] the hidden truth of the divinization of the Stalinist Leader into a supreme Genius who can give advice on almost any topic, from how to repair a tractor to how to cultivate flowers: what this Leader&#039;s intervention in everyday life means is that things do not function on the most everyday level--what kind of country is this, in which the supreme Leader himself has to dispense advice about how to repair tractors?&quot; (Zizek, Slavoj. Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism? Verso [New York]: 2002, 120). Could we not ask precisely the same questions about political candidates today? In their pathetic attempts to learn vocational trades and thereby demonstrate &quot;solidarity&quot; for working people--which are, more than anything, reminiscent of young children during Take Your Child To Word Day attempting to &quot;help&quot; their parent with his or her task--do we not have the precise neoliberal equivalent of the Stalinist process that Zizek details above? Although there&#039;s really no hope of reigning in global Capital, which has ceased to play by any rules but its own--which is to say, although politicians really have no idea what the socio-economic future will hold--they can still play idly, as if with toys, with the tools of the working class (or, more sincerely, the tools of working class oppression), and then make sweeping speeches about looking out for American jobs etc. etc. And this time around, it&#039;s even more insidious than with Stalin: instead of the leader dispensing advice to the useless People (as, let&#039;s not forget, an affirmation of that People), it&#039;s the people dispensing advice to the useless Leader--as an affirmation, perversely enough, of that Leader. Of course, the very &quot;ordinariness&quot; of politicians, as represented in spectacles such as these, is precisely what ensures their auratic--one is even tempted to say, &quot;extra-human&quot;--occupation of an ontological-symbolic echelon above that of the layperson; these little moments of (ultimately false, of course) connection between politicians and &quot;real people&quot; that serve to underscore how truly different politicians are from us, which is what leads to ridiculous, at times disturbing, kinds of pathological fixation: Even though I have no idea how to transform health care and fight Evil and do the right thing all around, I&#039;m sure Obama has the answers! (And all I have to do is be audacious!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, of course, nobody will have any legitimate answers until we start having an adult discussion about the constitutive antagonisms of social life, and that would require having an adult discussion about capitalism: how it can only reproduce itself through exploitation, how it relies on concrete violence to maintain &quot;normal conditions,&quot; etc.--which isn&#039;t very pleasant and certainly isn&#039;t in the interest of any individual presidential candidate (or really any institutional authority figure for that matter). Which brings us back to those pesky engineer-terrorists: It&#039;s difficult to understand why they&#039;re upset, especially when they&#039;re basically the only members of the professional elite who are. In fact, in direct contrast to politicians, engineer-terrorists seem to be precisely those institutional authority figures who ARE interested in having an adult discussion about the economic and social effects capitalism--a discussion that always gets nipped pre-emptively in the bud, and thus channeled into acts of obscene, excessive militancy. It&#039;s intriguing, to say the least, that engineers, who more or less personify military-industrial knowledge production, are nevertheless least amenable to the calcification of neoliberal power. In an age marked by cacophonies of technocratic apologia coming from experts whose livelihoods could quite conceivably get trampled by future economic developments (pundits, economists, sociologists, etc.), engineers--the backbone of technocratic society par excellence--display a counterintuitive propensity to dismantle it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>poetry &amp; language in &quot;stars in my pocket...&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/209</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something that I mentioned in class, but what particularly interests me about in Delany&#039;s book is the protagonist&#039;s relationship with poetry and carefully chosen language. I can&#039;t really even articulate it very well due to the sheer abundance of detail that is given, but poetry seems to be connected in his brain somehow with sex, desire, and a sort of ethereal musical harmony. This was the passage I found where it stands out the most: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first sound came. (Why didn&#039;t he open his eyes?) I have heard some evelmi say that the untutored human voice is generally more pleasing to them in song than the trained one--even though they respect the training&#039;s intention. The rougher vibrations resemble the multiplicity of sounds from multiple tongues. What I heard first, by whatever part of the ear meters and measures and counts despite all conscious intention was...well, as clear as any pattern I&#039;d heard that many times...dactyl, spondee, dactyl, trochee...&quot; (pp. 254-255)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long passage, I know. I noticed that dactyls, spondees and trochees are different syllabic combinations used in formal poetry. What I got from my first glean of this passage was a deep-rooted desire for order and organization. The multiple vibrations resonating in harmony, the counting and metering of language, and his appreciation of poetic formality might be ways of finding sanctuary, by pretending that there is order in the midst of chaos, maybe? Ironically I sympathized with him because I was looking for some order in the chaos of this book! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a certain tactile quality that he recognizes in language and speech. shown by the images of tongues and vibrating voices. Sex has been so distanced from humanity in this book that it&#039;s possible that he&#039;s trying to re-connect them again, by reconnecting his words with his body. Anyway, I feel like this is a rambling mess, but I&#039;m curious to see what you all think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 6 - Women.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/207</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the use of the female pronoun for everyone except the person to whom you are attracted is an effective way of referring to people. It may be ambiguous in some situations, but I think that it sufficiently describes the actual interaction between gender and sexuality, in a way that more concrete terminology does not. Why should our language enforce an emphasis on physical sex when describing attraction? There are numerous other ways to accomplish this, as well as other ways to remove the physical gender of the speaker from direct emphasis, but I think that the method in &quot;Stars&quot; is quite a bit more effective. In other methods, it is necessary to retain the language of gender to refer to a particular individual, usually as the gender to which they had not been traditionally assigned, and similarly to refer to the people to whom they are attracted. The &quot;Stars&quot; method allows the separation between gender and physical sex to be entirely complete. The assignation of gender to an individual is no longer arbitrary, or socially constructed.&lt;br /&gt;
An excellent example of the efficiency of this method in sexual situations comes when Marq interacts with Clym, the assassin. Marq begins interacting with Clym more &quot;out of boredom than real lust,&quot; but after they have had sex, during most of their conversation, Marq refers to Clym as &quot;him,&quot; indicating some level of attraction (89). It is only after Clym describes torturing Marq for pleasure that Clym is &quot;she,&quot; because Marq is clearly too frightened to be attracted (97). It is a very clear distinction, for Marq, and it is conveyed in a precise manner.&lt;br /&gt;
This clarity, at least for me, was only really come by after the fact, however. To someone familiar only with our current language, it is difficult not to wonder to what physical sex each &quot;woman&quot; in the book belongs. It was confusing for quite a while, and until I got used to it, it made things quite confusing. I think this is really only a product of the culture and language in which I experienced the book. I don&#039;t think the method in concept would be confusing to those who were using it. I think that a reference to gender in a pervasive context in language is fundamentally unnecessary. The &quot;Stars&quot; method maintains words for physical sex (Male and Female), and uses them when clarification is necessary. In most common speech, however, it is not necessary to know the physical sex of the person speaking.&lt;br /&gt;
I would not make the argument that the method would work in our culture, by any means. As it stands now, there is far too much emphasis placed culturally on gender to allow its complete removal from the language. We cannot simply begin referring to everyone else as &quot;women&quot; without some serious misinterpretation and misunderstanding. That is not, however, a normative argument. I think that a better culture would have no need to refer to gender so pervasively.&lt;br /&gt;
And that, I think, is what most impresses me about Delany&#039;s construction. It may provide some misunderstanding to those unfamiliar with it, but the re-organization that he has created has a specific, clear purpose, and is applied consistently enough to provide an entirely new perspective on interpersonal interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
But why choose &quot;him&quot; as the object of sexual attraction, and &quot;her&quot; as the neutral pronoun? I think that, superficially, the decision had a lot to do with Delany&#039;s own sexuality. I think there&#039;s more to it, though. Choosing &quot;woman&quot; as the standard, professional reference flies in the face of typical interaction in our culture. If everyone had been referred to as &quot;him&quot; in Delany&#039;s book, it would seem natural to think of everyone as male (as it was in &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot;), whereas referring to everyone as &quot;her&quot; made me, at least, unable to come to any immediate conclusions about each character&#039;s gender in my mind. Again, I don&#039;t think Delany does not do anything with language without some purpose in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Detail in Delany&#039;s world</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/205</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part about Samuel Delany&#039;s Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand is the immense amount of detail he puts into his world.  In the introductory passage about Rat Korga, the amount of back-story in the world is simply incredible.  At first, the novel merely hints at interesting events, polar research stations, and the q-plague.  But when Korga is bought illegally and hooked up to General Information, the amount of work Delany has put into his world really shows.  Korga is soon asked what the four largest geosectors on the world are.  He answers perfectly, with four names that actually sound like they fit into the world he is on.  Next, the four smallest.  And yet again, Korga answers with names that fit into the world.  &quot;Hebel-E&quot; is my favorite, because it suggests something behind that strange hyphenated E at the end of the word.  The four names weren&#039;t merely random made up words; they seem to have some though behind them.  That really helps Delany&#039;s world come to life.  Next come the books that Korga reads.  He reads over 50 books, and to most authors that would be enough to say.  Delany on the other hand names almost all of them, and names that seem to make sense for the planet they live on.  Two are named a variant of sand, one after wind.  Each of the books has some sort of blurb given about it as Korga assimilates its text.  Here the sheer though Delany puts into his back story is amazing.  Not only does each novel fully realize itself, it also makes references to other authors and novels that Korga read, in a way that doesn&#039;t seem contrived.  When these books that Korga read fit together, they bring forth a life on the world that seems far stronger than that seen through the rat so far.  Delany is a master at giving hints of back-story, which fit in well with the story and keep the work entertaining.  Later on, he uses GI and Vondramach to do the same thing, fill in holes of information with interesting tidbits.  In the process he creates a very vibrant world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sygn and Family</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/203</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What acts and thoughts in day-to-day life separate a member of the Family from the Sygn? To begin with, one must make an attempt at determining the particular values of each faction. Keeping in mind the potential bias of the Sygn-affiliated narrator, the Family centers around the &quot;father-mother-sonâ€¦basic family unit&quot; (119). At the same time, the narrator emphasizes that the particular family structure itself matters less than the accompanying power structure. For an example, she suggests, &quot;in the Family structure, the parents are seen to protect and enclose the children, to protect them from society&quot; (120). The Sygn paradigm contains a multitude of alternatives, including the Dyeth&#039;s stream structure, in which &quot;the children are the connection between the parents and society&quot; (120). Sygn culture is about diversity of belief and liberal acceptance of differences â€“ even the Sygn itself has no set symbol, spelling, or pronunciation (97). In contrast, the Family can be characterized by a lack of flexibility. Their children are a representation of their entire way of life â€“ both need protecting from the countless alien alternatives existing in this vast universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Chris West offers really interesting insight into these issues in his article, &quot;Perverting Science Fiction: Thinking the Alien Within the Genre.&quot; He suggests that a key differnence between the Sygn and Family can be found in that &quot;the dominant culture on [the Sygn] section of their world does not subscribe to compulsory monogamy, nor to compulsoty heterosexuality, nor does it turn its face from interspecies liaison&quot; (West 108). Why does the sexual take on such an important role? To Family members, Sygn sexual behavior fails to protect their family&#039;s identity. It would already appear easy enough to lose one&#039;s identity and history in this universe of seemingly limitless people and information; promiscuous sex (and the associated risk of children outside of the protective Oedipal family structure embrace), homosexual/interspecies sex (and the abandonment of persuing children) further the threat to the fundamental unit of the Family worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, how does the issue of identity function within Sygn culture? Clearly this issue is the primary driving force of all Family interactions, as the control of information and contempt for the above-mentioned sexual behavior both derive from the same culture-propagation instinct. But does this exist within the Sygn? The narrator often discusses her ancestors and the Dyeth history. Historical cultural knowledge seems to be prized and is made readily available through the Web. Historical figures, Vondramach in particular, create context in which the characters interact and provide insight into the issues faced (so that history won&#039;t repeat itself? E.g. Availability of the rings for Rat Korgaâ€¦). A Sygn point of view, while inclusionary and adaptive, does seem to preserve some sense of appreciation of the past. The difference remains centered around how the two worldviews imagine going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possibility of a mixed-race president and multiracial people as the fastest growing race in the country, I think the implications for contemporary American politics are huge. Instead of obsessively persuing a return to life &#039;the way it was,&#039; the Sygn encourage moving forward toward cross-racial and cross-cultural interaction while remaining grounded in an understanding of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose the &quot;Joyce of science fiction&quot; review on the back should have been a warning, but I really thought I could make sense of this book. Maybe Cyteen will make up in clarity what it clearly lacks in brevity...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Humanity / Non-humanity / Inhumanity (Delany response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/201</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine out of ten theorists agree: Volition, while constitutive of humanity, leads immutably to anxiety (in the &quot;doomed to freedom&quot; sense), from which it follows that the subversion of volition is simultaneously utopian and dystopian in its socio-political impulse; it liberates us from the burden of assuming autonomous subject positions in the world, but in so doing, it undermines the very core of our being. I hardly need to re-iterate for all of you the difficulties of liberal subjectivity--constantly excercising agency in order to make rational choices, taking steps to get closer and closer to one&#039;s authentic, Platonic Self. The opening scene of Stars in Your Pocket Like Grains of Sand affirms these basic coordinates of humanity: to be human signifies the ability, and the material wherewithal, to achieve more than a monosyllabic response (&quot;yes&quot;) to questions like &quot;Do you choose happiness?&quot;--to realize, in fact, being human means contending with the complexities of this question, even when that process requires flouting happiness as such. (This is why Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;last men&quot; are so nightmarish in their self-satisfied willing of manufactured pleasure: their rallying cry, &quot;We invented happiness,&quot; is monstrously hollow, a slogan of pure jouissance, in which lack and excess fuse perversely and endlessly, without meaning, without humanity.) This opening scene is remiscent of another famous opening from the science fiction canon: the gom jobbar test from Frank Herbert&#039;s Dune, in which the protagonist, Paul, undergoes an evaluation of his humanity, during which he is forced to keep his hand in a pain-generator. What solidifes his human stats--a status that most readers generally treat as immutable, which is partly why the scene is so memorable--is his ability to recognize, but nonetheless withstand, the pain. The metaphyscial claim is equivalent: humanity inheres in the very space of contingency in which &quot;autonomy&quot;--but also pain and suffering--articulate themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both narratives potray heterogeneously comprised landscapes in which Earthly humans are, refreshingly enough, eclipsed by other planets and species. By and large, though, humanity still reigns, albeit in allegorical form, such that questions like, &quot;Are those creatures human?&quot; are replaced by more politically meaningful questions like, &quot;Do the &#039;other&#039; species conform to our standards of (nearly always liberal) humanism?&quot; In this sense, the significance of Delaney and Herbert&#039;s respective work basically conforms to the problematic layed out by Freedman in the Reagan/Terminator article with which the course began: Is the political field presented in [text] humanistic or anti-humanistic--and why should we concerned citizens of the real (i.e., non-textual) world care one way or the other? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll confess my own cognitive dissonance at this point: I find the humanism/anti-humanism binary fascinating, but nevertheless politically bankrupt, since any adjudication between humanistic and anti-humanistic politics seems to delimit in advance (and in overwhelmingly liberal terms) what &quot;counts&quot; as politics. (Note: On this point, I diverge from Freedman. Although undeniable differences certainly exist w/r/t their respective modes and tropes of articulation, I would argue that humanism and anti-humanism simply express the internal split of humanism [much like the &quot;pleasure principle&quot; and the &quot;death drive&quot; are not categorically different types of subjectivity, but rather express the internal split of subjectivity itself], and it&#039;s merely an unfortunate linguistic technicality of Freedman&#039;s argument. I have trouble, for instance, when Freedman claims that humanism is present-tense Utopian in its belief that social problems can be solved by human goodwill, whereas anti-humanism is present-tense dystopian in its belief that Evil is not entirely surmountable--could this not be re-read as an expression of ambiguity w/r/t the temporality of Utopian discourse, i.e., the way in which Utopian imaginaries are inherently futural, and for that reason, necessarily ascribe certain dystopian qualities to the present moment?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, I&#039;m drawn to, but also put off by, Freedman&#039;s work--and Delaney&#039;s and Herbert&#039;s--because the need to move beyond humanism, in ways that evade what I&#039;m inclined to label as the *totalitarian* pitfalls of post-Reaganite anti-humanism, seems so clearly necessary. One possibility for critical inquiry in this regard lies in the concept of undeath, which plays on the linguistic ambiguity between &quot;non-human&quot; and &quot;inhuman&quot;--whereas the former simply negates the positive content of &quot;humanity&quot; (e.g., alive, conscious, etc.), the latter supplements &quot;humanity&quot; with an excessive, unsettling quality (the inhuman figure is &quot;more human,&quot; in some sense, than the human him/herself). Could we propose something similar with regard to Freedman&#039;s humanism / anti-humanism distinction? What would it mean to explore the &quot;politics of inhumanity&quot; as an explicit antidote to the obverse complimentarity of humanistic and anti-humanism?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the end of days</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/200</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the conception of the Apocalypse in Samuel Delaney&#039;s Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand the most interesting part of the book.  Delaney&#039;s idea of how worlds end is so different from other books and from popular thought. For one thing, it is not really an Apocalypse, an end of days â€“ life, and culture, goes on even after a world has been destroyed by that enigmatic thing, the Cultural Fugue.  Secondly, the world does not end by asteroid collision, or by a trigger-happy country with too many nuclear warheads but by information, and by culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters are a little fuzzy in explaining exactly how information and culture destroys worlds, but it does not sound nearly as flashy.  The closest anyone gets to defining what constitutes a Cultural Fugue, that I could find at least, is when Marq Dyeth says Cultural Fugue happens when &quot;the socioeconomic pressuresâ€¦reach a point of technological recomplication and perturbation where the population completely destroys all life across the planetary surface&quot; (66).  Frustratingly vague for a reader who does not know when the critical point of &quot;technological recomplication and perturbation&quot; is generally reached, and how exactly the population destroys itself.  Would a nuclear holocaust fit under the umbrella of the Cultural Fugue?  Even if it does, it is presumably not the only way, so what other dastardly ways does life have of snuffing itself out?  Are they ways we have not even conceived of yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how exactly life ends, the general threat has been deemed to be information.  Exactly how one deals with such a threat is a major point of difference for the political movements of the worlds, but no one seems to deny that it does pose some kind of a threat.  In the prologue, the Rat&#039;s owner describes the boundless knowledge of General Information, then goes on to say: &quot;Can you imagine?  Living in a world where, if you want to know something â€“ anything, anything at all! â€“ all you have to do is think about it, and the answer pops into your head?  That&#039;s supposed to be how it works.  Even our Free-Informationists are scared to go that far.  They think we&#039;d slide over into Cultural Fugue in a minute!&quot; (24).  People need protection, not from guns or bombs or meteors, but from knowledge, which seems so innocuous in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is that the Apocalypse (I&#039;m not sure what else to call it) is something definite, a real threat that has actually happened in the recorded past and will definitely happen again, somewhere, in the future.  It is not some vague threat that may or may not ever happen.  In addition, the concept of the end of the world is not quite so catastrophic in Delaney&#039;s universe.  If one world ends, there are more around to continue.  They are there to take in the few survivors, mourn the dead, and carry on culture and society.  If my planet were to implode in Cultural Fugue, I wonder whether I would be reassured or annoyed that somewhere in the known universe, everyday life is toodling along, unconcerned with my death.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The mental status of the rats seems a little unclear. Clearly, they are seen as possessing far less than normal human intelligence. They are treated as animals (rats!) and have to be carefully instructed to perform even simple tasks. For example, the trainer in Muct says &quot;You tell a rat to take a shit, you gotta remember to tell &#039;er to pull her pants down first and pull &#039;em up afterwards.&quot; (14) Yet the man at the RAT institute says the procedure to become a rat will not change the narrator in the prologue, (5) and indeed it does not seem to other than the obvious effect on his will. He had trouble understanding things before; he still does after. However, after he gets the glove, the narrator is able to learn quickly and well, and it seems to be implied that his lack of understanding and personality before was largely caused by a lack of knowledge, the cycle of stupidity. (29) Once he begins to learn things, he feels and acts much more intelligent, and much more like a person. But if this is true, then why are all rats seen as stupid? Is it simply prejudice, a prejudice that they cannot combat because they have lost their volition? If not, how can the narrator&#039;s seemingly &quot;natural&quot; and curable stupidity be reconciled with the apparent loss of intellectual ability experienced by other rats?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 6? (I think?)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/198</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that stood out for me in Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand was the impact that sheer size in population can have on life (I saw one other blog post on this but I did not read it so hopefully there is not any overlap). One instance in which this is exemplified is the initial matching of Rat Korga and Marq Dyeth. When we first find out that Rat Korga and Marq Dyeth are supposedly fit for each other, the two men have been characterized in ways that made them radically different from each other. The entire prologue followed Rat Korga and described life on Rhyonon. In the beginning of the novel, Rat Korga undergoes essentially a lobotomy, and as a result, the whole introduction was written in a very somber, dull tone. Throughout Rat Korga&#039;s time on Rhyonon, he lives life as a RAT â€“ in other words, a slave - and spends his time doing mindless labor while being continually abused. At one point, one of Rat Korga&#039;s employers beats him while in a rage because Rat has been sold to a different employer. This experience perfectly encapsulates Rat&#039;s experience on Rhyonon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked and watched stories for three years; then one morning the man in charge came to kick him awake.&lt;br /&gt;
He pushed himself up to his elbow.&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;They sold you!&#039; The man kicked him again, about as hard as he&#039;d ever been kicked, so that he fell back down and had to up again. &#039;How you like that! They sold you out from under me! I&#039;ve really worked on you, too, you mindless rat! You don&#039;t treat a damned man like that. (Delany, 15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on Rhyonon tended to view RATs as subhuman slaves who were more like tools than people. The existence of mindless slaves was not the only primitive aspect of Rhyonon. As we learn later on in the novel, Rhyonon is also largely cut off from the Web and therefore the rest of the universe, which makes Rat Korga seem even more primitive. Compare this with section with the main body of the novel, where we get a first-person account of Marq Dyeth&#039;s adventures. Here, the tone dramatically shifts to become more upbeat to reflect the increased vibrancy of the new worlds that we hear about. In contrast to Rat Korga, Marq Dyeth is very mentally sharp, which enables him to be an industrial diplomat, traveling from world to world interacting with a wide variety of species. His job requires him to be extremely familiar with the Web, which further sets him apart from Rat since Rat has always been very out of touch with his world and the surrounding universe. In spite of all these differences, however, Rat Korga and Marq Dyeth are found to be almost perfect erotic matches for each other. What does it mean when two completely different people are found to be erotically ideal for each other? I think one of the things that the whole matchmaking episode served was to highlight the impact that sheer size in population can have on life. In one memorable line from the novel, Japril states, &quot;But the thing you can be sure of in this day and age is that no one is the &#039;most&#039; of anything; just the &#039;most&#039; you happen to know about&quot; (Delany, 159). The matchmaking episode and the line from Japril remind us that if humanity ever reaches a point where we are living in a galactic civilization, there can really be no certainty in life, even with the presence of the Web. Life will have reached such a grand scale that everything can always be called into question because there may be some world light years away that has the answer. People involved in romantic relationships could wonder whether one of the 12 million other perfect erotic matches would work better, and with the aid of the Web, they could realistically reach those people. Ultimately, living on such a galactic scale would offer great diversity in life but perhaps also instability.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stars in my Pocket response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/197</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects I found in Stars in my Pocket like Grains of Sand was the difference between modern hunting and the &#039;dragon hunting&#039; between pgs 239 and 257.  At first, hunting in the deserts of Velm appears very similar to our human hunting; leaving for a wilderness area, using large &#039;weapons&#039;, receiving advice over territory or placement from an experienced hunter, and eventually finding and firing at the prey, taking something from the prey in the process. The first major difference here is the wanted result.  While real-world hunters seek to kill the prey as fast as possible and in good enough condition for food, skinning or other purposes, hunters on Velm desire to get a glimpse into the mind of the prey for a time and experience all of its senses.  Instead of taking and using for personal, material comfort or pleasure, the Velm hunter shares the preys&#039; experience, and leaves the creature untouched and completely unaware of the hunter&#039;s intrusions.&lt;br /&gt;
	Neither act is necessary; we have an abundance of food in the USA, and the inhabitants of Velm have many alternate sources of entertainment. Yet, both peoples still do it, and on a fairly common basis.  The Earth style of hunting creates a moral conundrum for the people, but has a more distinct purpose and culture behind it.  Hunting is one f the earliest arts that humanity ever developed; we started as nothing more than hunter-gatherers before tribal society emerged.  Later, at any stage in our progress before agriculture could be instated, or any time we expanded outward to new territory, hunting was a primary means of support.  In short, hunting was an integral part of our humanity, though today it may not be as important as in the developmental periods.  Unfortunately, we are missing one important piece of information:  while our form of hunting was at one time essential to survival in the pre-modern USA, we do not know if the Velm mode of hunting was ever crucial to evelm and/or humans on their planet.  The culture behind hunting is hinted at in the last part of the chapter (pg 251-257) when the narrator goes into depth explaining the importance of Singing after the hunt, but it still appears to be more for entertainment or art than survival.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think the major point here is that we still kill even having moved past the kill-for-food stage, which is both harmful and unnecessary.  We claim it is part of a great heritage, an art that should not be lost; yet with how destructive it is to the prey, is it really justified?  Should entertainment or tradition (since there is no longer necessity) come at such a cost?  It is through these differences between our planet and Velm that the key criticism of our ways appears most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that struck me in reading Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand was the perspective.  It might be just because I missed the switch from third to first person in Lillith&#039;s Brood, but I found myself getting caught completely off-guard by the switch here.  Obviously, Delany chooses to make this movement for a reason--he doesn&#039;t seem to do anything without reason in this novel.&lt;br /&gt;
From the very beginning, the reader is alienated from Korga as a character.  The novel starts out with complete ambiguity: &quot;&#039;Of course,&#039; they told him in all honestyâ€¦&quot; (Delany 3).  There are no names given, although there is a physical description.  In fact, Korga&#039;s name is not given until the perspective switches to Marq.  Throughout the entire time period on Korga&#039;s home planet, Rhyonon, the readers are left in the dark about his name.  Although this could be a simple overlook, it seems doubtful in a work as intricate as Stars.  In contrast, I think it serves a very important purpose--because of the lack of a name, readers are forced into the mindset of Korga&#039;s home planet.  The only option that readers have to think about Korga is his status, Rat.  Because he is so nameless, Korga fades into nothing more than a slave among other nameless slaves.  Simple statements like &quot;around him, thousands of rats serviced the great city full of machines&quot; are confusing simply because they emphasize the unimportant nature of Rat (Delany 13).  His humanity dissolves because of his anonymity--he is reduced to a mindless machine not only because of the operation, but also because of his namelessness.&lt;br /&gt;
Korga&#039;s lack of identity in the entire first section of the book makes the mention of his name on page 61 very disarming.  The immediate reaction of the reader is to connect the new character of &quot;Rat Korga&quot; with the nameless Rat from the first section (Delany 61).  However, I was a little bit unsure about this instant connection--because Rat wasn&#039;t ever really identified before, there was the possibility that this new Korga character was actually someone new.  This idea doesn&#039;t fade immediately because Delany doesn&#039;t let his readers contemplate the possibility--he moves on to describe Marq&#039;s life and doesn&#039;t return to Korga for another twenty pages.  Again, the reader almost forgets about Korga, letting him fade in comparison to the much more thorough character of Marq.&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the instant identification with Marq is due to the sheer level that Delaney gives to this character.  He gives Marq&#039;s name instantly, and the readers know his occupation, a little bit about his world, and some of his &quot;earliest memories&quot; (Delany 74).  This information serves as a sharp contrast to the lack of character given to Korga.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the flatness of Rat&#039;s character in comparison to Marq&#039;s, there is also the matter of perspective.  Rat&#039;s section is third person, a perspective that helps to alienate the reader from Korga.  If the third-person voice is alienating, then it follows that the first-person perspective helps the reader to identify more with Marq.  From the beginning of his section, the reader is placed inside of Marq&#039;s head.&lt;br /&gt;
I can&#039;t help but wonder why exactly Delany chose to do this: is it simply to give Marq more personality than Korga? Personally, I enjoyed the first part of the novel more than the stories centered on Marq, although this might be an outlier opinion.  Either way, whether Marq or Korga is more likeable, Delany intentionally makes Rat much less relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Random thoughts on subscripts...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/193</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was browsing the blog and felt like I would try and comment on dragongrrl&#039;s note about hoping someone comments about the subscripts. My initial reaction was that they seemed a bit silly. As though Delany was somehow trying to make the novel look more scientific by adding subscripts in like one would add subscripts to variables or chemical equations. I was a bit disappointed by this, but as the story went on I came to understand that use of subscripts was an interesting was to differentiate between the type of relationship a person has with her different occupations. (Also, I couldn&#039;t get the subscripts to actually be subscripts, but oh well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the use of the subscripts was interesting basically because to me it seemed to imply different levels of connectedness between the person and their occupation. The first level was just what we would think of as a job. The place we go each day to make a living. For Marq, work1 was her job as an Industrial Diplomat, traveling about and getting various jobs completed.  When the students are introduced, it is mentioned that two of them have jobs1 as evelmian ethnologists. The relationship between an occupation1 and what we would consider an occupation seemed fairly straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was Marq&#039;s job2. I&#039;m still not totally sure what this was but it came across as something much more intrinsic than her job1 as an Industrial Diplomat. It almost seemed to me as though this was something that Marq had been expected to do for all of her life.  My impression of this comes from a part on page 108 when Marq is talking to Alsrod about how she has been trying since childhood to get the statue of Mother Dyeth to turn on. According to Alsrod, Marq was just doing part of her job2.  This mention of her job2, as well as other mentions, made me think that this occupation2 related in some way to an understanding of her home and family as well as a passing on of that knowledge. For instance, orientating the new students was considered Marq&#039;s job2, rather than job2 and the orientation sessions are referred to as sessions2 (191).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there was a certain level of occupation that each person had which was more intrinsic than what we would normally consider a job was quite interesting. People seem to have a job2 which they are expected to work towards for their entire lives, perhaps indicating that one&#039;s occupation2 and self are more closely connected than what we might normally consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a third level of job. Marq mention that her hands are &quot;of a fairly small, somewhat hairy fellow who only uses them for manual labor one job2 out of three&quot; (201). Unfortunately for me I didn&#039;t write down any other mentions of this third occupation although I think there was one place where a job3 was referred to.  My question about this job3 is; what could be deeper to Marq than her job2? Her job2 already seems to be an essential part of her character and something she has been doing her whole life, so I am curious as to what could be even more a part of her than this.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Planets in my mind</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/192</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects of Samuel Delany&#039;s &quot;Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand&quot; was the notion of proportion.  Certainly, the title is a powerful contributor to this theme.  Comparing stars, massive balls of matter whose energy and size are beyond the comprehension of the human mind, to the matter which causes the lining of pockets to be uncomfortable, conveys the basic disconnect in the perception of proportion in the book.  The descriptions continuously challenge the reader to conceptualize reality on a different scale than daily life promotes.&lt;br /&gt;
	This challenge comes primarily in the form of the perception of size.  The universe presented contains six thousand plus worlds where humans have settled, and the majority of those worlds contain on the order of hundreds of millions of people.  This alone stretches the ideas of the proportional significance of humanity.  As the world is today, it is difficult develop a notion of the whole of humanity.  While I can understand the world as it is in terms of nations and social classes and environmental surroundings, any sort of categorization applied to such diversity over hundreds of light-years seems like it would break down in my mind.  Yet, humanity has apparently adapted to the change in scale of the medium across which it operates.  For example, Vondramach is a historical figure which shows the new potential for a megalomaniac.  Her influence was on a completely different scale than what people are familiar with today.  She controlled multiple planets, and somehow managed to gain notoriety throughout all of humanity, years and years after her death, as dispersed as it was.  The magnitude of that kind of personality is incomprehensible.  How can a single person have such a large effect on a system which I can barely comprehend?&lt;br /&gt;
	This difficulty with size also appears in the discussions of cultural fugue.  This disease/cultural state, is described early in the book as the series of events which leads to the elimination of all life on planet.  When we first see Marq, he is performing his duties as an industrial diplomat on a planet inhabited by a strange gooey people, they ask him whether their planet is at risk for the cultural fugue, as if it is some natural disaster, with cause beyond their control.  They seem like they are no more able to control it than we are able to control global warming.  Yet, their fear doesn&#039;t seem to be based on a scientific correlation, but on some pre-established notion of how planetary life-cycle.  I believe this is also a reflection of the different proportion of perspective in this new universe.  Rather than analyze the problems of any individual world within it&#039;s own context, worlds are diagnosed the way the human body is.  All six thousand provide a larger context such that an individuals planet&#039;s problems no longer have the same significance, and can be compared qualitatively to the problems of others.  This leader asking whether her planet will experience the cultural fugue is like someone with poison oak and a cold asking the doctor whether she&#039;s got the bubonic plague.&lt;br /&gt;
	Truly, I think that the issue of the cultural fugue is the most disorienting aspect of the story.  Aside from the popular treatment of the issue, the destruction of all life on a planet is something incomprehensible, even to the characters of the story.  This issue is represented in the issue of survivors.  Marq latches on to the idea that there MUST be survivors of the scorched planet Rhyonon, but encounters difficulty in conceptualizing what that means.  Japril challenges him to think about what a survivor means in the context of an entire planet, saying, &quot;When a world is destroyed â€“a whole world, Marq--there are so many fuzzy edged phenomena,&quot; (149).  A planet is so large, and has such extensive influence, that to give the disaster any defined borders is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>un-gendering pronouns</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/191</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(Note: when writing &quot;employer,&quot; I did want to have the subscript 1 [I hope someone talks about this] but it didn&#039;t copy over to the blog and I don&#039;t know if/what html coding would do this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we started to discuss on Monday, one of the most intriguing and often startling things about Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand  by Samuel Delany is the use of &quot;she&quot; as the default pronoun for both male and female humans and nonhumans--collectively &quot;women.&quot; The first problem this presents, of course, is confusion for the reader, because the reader does not live in a world where this usage is the same. I was quite confused especially when in the beginning Marq is talking with her (I will attempt to discuss the world in its own terms) employer on Nepiy and calls both her employer and her employer&#039;s human friend &quot;she,&quot; while they call each other &quot;he&quot; (62). Eventually the reader finds out that &quot;she&quot; refers to anybody, while &quot;he&quot; refers to an object of sexual desire--both regardless of the biological sex of the woman in question. One thing this does is effectively remove cultural gender and renders differences in sex basically meaningless. In doing this, Delany shows how unnecessarily important gender is to our society--the reader constantly wonders about the gender of each individual character mentioned because it is rarely given, and when it is, it is given late in the introduction. Not only does this point out the problematic fascination for identification but it shows that a society can work fairly well without the constant identification we have. Interestingly, the step from modern society to the world(s) in Stars is not unlike the transfer from permanently gendered words in romance languages like Spanish to English which has mostly neutrals. The difference, of course, lies in the language of Marq&#039;s society. They use the same gendered pronouns we have today to talk about other women, but their meaning has completely changed. &quot;She&quot; doesn&#039;t mean a female woman, &quot;she&quot; means any woman. &quot;He&quot; means a woman to whom the speaker is sexually attracted, not a male woman. &quot;Woman,&quot; itself, has replaced the word &quot;person,&quot; which is quite helpful in the society in Stars because it can refer to any species, while &quot;person&quot; refers simply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another effect this new use of pronouns has on the society in Stars is the way sexuality is viewed. Intriguingly, male homosexuality seems the norm, not a deviation, in this society. Whether or not this is true, the appearance of it comes from two places. First, the first-person protagonist, Marq, is a homosexual male woman, so it is discussed in a very natural way. Second, the object one woman&#039;s desire is always &quot;he,&quot; and therefore male in our eyes, and thus the original woman is considered &quot;he&quot; in the eyes of the other; to the reader, this makes all sexual relations appear to be between male women. There is still, obviously, a variety of sexual preferences in the world of Stars, and (at least on Sygn worlds) sex in general seems a very free idea. No one particularly cares what or how much sex other women have. The argument could be made that by removing gender from the language helps create this general tolerance in the culture of the types of sexual relations that occur. Not only does this blur the lines of homo- and heterosexuality, but the language used in essence removes the reproduction aspect of sex (&quot;sperm and egg,&quot; as Marq puts it) and leaves sex simply as a pleasurable act. There are many other techniques this society uses for reproduction, as evidenced by the great variety of genes that make up the members of Marq&#039;s family, or stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note about the language usage is something that was briefly mentioned in class but not discussed: Why did Delany pick the female as the neutral, default term? Considering Le Guin&#039;s choice of the opposite and the way we often write, this does appear strange. Likely, Delany wanted to point out how neither term, to us, really is neutral--because if they were, why would we complain about using the female as the baseline? It was startling to read a book written this way, and I often found myself replacing &quot;women&quot; with &quot;men&quot; because I&#039;m used to understanding groups of people in terms of the so-called neutral male status. What&#039;s even more intriguing to me is something that we discussed Monday night in my neuroscience class that I&#039;m not sure Delany knew: the baseline sex for humans is indeed female. Human fetuses, until about eight weeks old, have two sets of possible genitalia--one of which ends up disappearing, the other of which grows into either male or female sex organs. At about eight weeks, if the fetus is genetically male, the Y-chromosome sparks the growth of male gonads which release testosterone and prompt the growth male genitalia. If it is genetically female or, for some reason, this testosterone release is never initiated, the fetus will become a female baby--whether or not it should be male based on its genes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>sex as the alien in lilith&#039;s brood (vols 2 and 3)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/190</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I went into more depth with this line of thought in my paper, but for some reason the Lilith&#039;s Brood trilogy got me thinking about how the subject (and act, ultimately) of sex is treated by our society, and why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vastly different attitudes of the humans and the Oankali towards sex is significant; it reveals itself is through language and the characters&#039; actions. The Oankali talk about &quot;sharing&quot; sex; the humans talk about &quot;having&quot; or &quot;getting&quot; it. In the human view, it is almost like a possession itself, or a method of possessing a partner. To the Oankali, it is a biological necessity for reproduction, but there is also a ritualistic element to it that is almost sacred. Humans use sex as a weapon (as in rape) to subjugate or control others; or, sex is demonized and treated as sinful or &quot;perverse&quot;. Humans make sex into something that is unnatural, &quot;other&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; in this way; which is reinforced by the fact that the Oankali, an alien species, embrace sexuality. It seems that the Oankali also use sex as a device, but to bring people together and deepen their intimacy, as Nikanj does with Lilith and Joseph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that the main flaw in my theory is that some of the Oankali sexual interaction with humans seems coerced, even forced. For example, when Nikanj is seducing Joseph, he says &quot;You see, your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (pp 189, Dawn). Does Nikanj somehow know what Joseph truly wants, or is it taking away his free will? In the same way, Nikanj tells Lilith &quot;You&#039;ll have a daughter, and you are ready to be her mother. You could never have said so. Just as Joseph could never have invited me into his bed, no matter how much he wanted me there. Nothing about you but your words reject this child&quot; (pp 247, Dawn).  The mind is supposed to be one of the fundamental things that a person controls about themselves; surely this control is not taken away so easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professed goal of the Oankali colonization is to allow humans to &quot;have a chance to live on your Earth, not just to die on it&quot; (pp 32, Dawn). And indeed, they do go about teaching them how to survive in strange terrain without killing unnecessarily. This preference for nonviolence is admirable. However, the realization that sexuality is not &quot;alien&quot; but natural is also a goal. Nikanj puts it, &quot;Let them learn that it isn&#039;t shameful to be together with one another and with us&quot; (pp 200, Dawn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trilogy, readers may sit back and find that they have embraced or at least accepted the idea of a third &#039;both-gender&#039; sex like the ooloi. The novel&#039;s depiction of sex as &quot;alien&quot; and yet inherently human is meant to encourage readers to critique societal attitudes that condemn sexuality as demonic, sinful or something to be feared. Butler&#039;s critique should lead us to question why our society treats open sexuality, appreciation of pleasure, and unconventional gender identities as &quot;alien&quot;. As the fate of the earliest humans in the novel suggests, these tendencies seem to ultimately lead to sexual repression, cyclical violence and the destruction of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Post-Humanism, Part One: Experiences in the Class Thus Far</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/189</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me about several of the novels we&#039;ve read thus far is that their speculation is based on human biology; specifically, the attempt to alter and control it. In the past I came across a word for this; post-humanism, a nebulous and ill-defined term, but one ultimately centered around the concept of building better humans. There have been aspects of this in most of the books we&#039;ve read, such as...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Starship Troopers: The soldiers rely even more on science than any in our history. The M-I are not so much foot soldiers as pilots for their suits, the equivalent of a second skin that enhances their durability and movement. The suits are much more personal than any conventional military vehicle, to the point where they move based on feedback from the pilot&#039;s body motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Neuromancer: Practically everyone is altered in some way; Case is described as a wasted human body whose utility is based primarily on his digital self. Molly takes a physical role, but she&#039;s full of various machines, such as her claws and her eyes. And there are characters like Wintermute and Neuromancer who act sentient, but that are hard to classify as human because they lack any biological components. Artificial intelligence, but hardly robotic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and The Left Hand of Darkness: Much harder to classify as post-human, because they&#039;re more about the examination of sexual relationships than scientific ones; not mutually exclusive, but generally these books are more about exploring biology as it is than what it could be. Still, the characters are altered in various ways; the Handmaid&#039;s Tale shows an attempt to control reproduction ( more socially than scientifically ), and The Left Hand of Darkness has the hemaphrodite characters use drugs to accelerate/stunt their &quot; kemmer &quot; period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Lilith&#039;s Brood: Probably the most post-human focused of all the books we&#039;ve read, because it not only has humans being altered by alien technology, but the results of that alteration across the generations. The Oankali, with their biological machines, attach new genes that change the human body. Not just in terms of healing the sick, but strengthening the basic human structure; Lilith is the best example, as she gains enhanced strength, regenerative powers, the ability to interface with the walls of the ship, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand: I&#039;m still working through this book as of this post, but the fact that &quot; rats &quot; ( humans altered to have enhanced capabilites and removed free will ) play so heavily into it suggests that similar ideas will come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these patterns is quite interesting; I&#039;ll have more comments on the post-human connections later...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cultural Fugue</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/188</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m having some trouble understanding a lot of this book.  One problem is I don&#039;t really know what the Cultural Fugue is.  Is it some sort of disease.  Is it access to a certain type of weapon?  My most educated guess, at this point, is that it is condition of society, like revolution, which ultimately leads to the destruction of all life on a planet.  However, I don&#039;t really know what the condition involves.  If anyone could point out certain passages for me, with regard to the Fugue, I would be very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Future of the Book - Lecture Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/187</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The future of the book, as Bob Stein argued, is in dialogue between the reader and the author. It will no longer be a static work, created by the author for a particular audience. &quot;Old school&quot; authors &quot;engage with the subject matter on behalf of the readers,&quot; whereas &quot;new school&quot; authors will &quot;engage with readers in the context of a subject matter&quot; (Stein, &quot;The Future of the Book: The Evolution of Reading and Writing in the Networked Era&quot;, March 1, 2008). Essentially, the reader interaction that has been occurring in the background of many books (especially recently, with author blogs, etc) will come to the foreground. Stein seems to have no problem with this vision, or any of its implications. He sees it as the logical next step, a new context in which we must re-examine our assumptions, but which comes at very little cost to the concept of literary authorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the examples given by Stein, he focuses on the application of his vision to academic writing, an area where it might very well excel. He makes the point that as the body of knowledge about a particular work of literature or, I think, any subject matter, becomes larger and larger, it cannot be understood by any one individual, and instead must be understood by a network of collaborative individuals. In an academic setting, this would work very well. The discussion of the subject matter is what an academic book is really all about. This discussion could be seen as an extension and democratization of the discussion and review process which already occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to only applying perfectly to academic writing, it seems to me that Stein&#039;s model only applies to certain personality types. There are those, like Siva Vaidhyanathan, a later speaker that day, whose greatest fear is never finishing their work, in some coherent form. This is only one implication that could frighten or discourage future authors. I can&#039;t imagine that every author would be comfortable with exposing their intimate thought processes to the world while writing, for example, an autobiography and deciding whether to include a scene portraying themselves in a bad light. In response to Vaidhyanathan, Stein argued that these inclinations are simply a product of the time and culture in which we live, and that future authors would think nothing of this sort of authorship. Stein may very well be right; I have no way of judging that. But I don&#039;t think that it is necessary to say that the more traditional form of authorship need be supplanted by Stein&#039;s model. Instead, we can see it as just another way in which literature can be produced, another art form to complement those already in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most damning argument against Stein&#039;s model is the fact that it would only really work for certain types of literature. I don&#039;t think a novel with such a definite, extreme vision like Lilith&#039;s Brood could have been written collaboratively. It requires the concerted effort of one inspired mind. This does not mean that the work cannot be reviewed, simply that the majority of the writing and conceptualizing must come from a single source. In addition, I think the type of fiction perpetuated in Lilith&#039;s brood requires a coherent and singular medium in which to exist. I don&#039;t think it could be effectively serialized. In fact, I think the serialization that would be required in Stein&#039;s model cheapens fiction in general, by forcing the author into a certain chapter structure that usually weakens the coherence and structure of the novel as a whole. Every chapter should not end in a cliffhanger that must entice the reader back for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think there is a place for books written in Stein&#039;s model. I think it would be an excellent template for future academic writing. However, I don&#039;t think that the complete turn from &quot;author engages with subject&quot; to &quot;author engages directly with readers&quot; is either beneficial or truly inevitable. I could easily see someone like Butler engaging with her readers during the process of writing Lilith&#039;s Brood, through a blog or a forum or what have you, but I think the necessary form for her final work needs to be the novel. As argued by Marsha Kinder, during the questions after Mr. Stein&#039;s talk, his model loses the explicit author-defined structure. This structure is necessary, I think, for works of fiction, and as such I don&#039;t believe Stein&#039;s model should be the &quot;future of the book.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Imago response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/186</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading &quot;Imago,&quot; I was continually struck by the growing resemblances between the Oankali and Humans.  And I am not referring to the Humans that lived with Oanklai, but rather the Humans who had refused to assimilate with the aliens.  I first noticed an Oankali acting uncharacteristically human when Jodahs and his family must leave their village.  Nikanj has to be assured that Lilith brought her machete.  Jodahs narrates, &quot;It could not have gotten more attention if it had screamed.  I focused on it to the exclusion of everything, felt pulled around to face it.  Oankali did not suggest violence.  Humans said violence was against Oankali beliefs.  Actually, it was against their flesh and bone, against every cell of them&quot; (564).  While Nikanj is of course rational in his fear of Human violence being inflicted on his family, he is speaking against a fundamental Oankali code.  Nikanj does reiterate that violence should only be used when absolutely necessary but Jodahs&#039; dismayed reaction is proof of how atypical Nikanj&#039;s question was.  Throughout the trilogy, the Oankali consider themselves on a more sophisticated plane than Humans because they do not harbor the genetic inclination towards violence.  The Oankali claimed that they had the need to heal.  They justified mass sterility because they were convinced that humans would breed violent creatures.  So for Nikanj to even suggest violence is rejecting everything its species stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Jodahs encountered Tomas and Jesusa, I recognized several qualities they shared with the Oankali.  On a purely aesthetic level, the siblings are as grotesque looking as the aliens.  Their tumors are the equivalent of the growths Jodahs must experience during his metamorphosis.  These humans can empathize with the feeling of being completely aware that people find them hideous.  The Oankali are so fascinated by the Humans that they find them to be beautiful.  This is not a shared feeling for the Humans.  They feel sexually attracted to the ooloi but this scares many of them.  Like Jodahs says at one point â€“ Humans are incredibly concerned with physical appearance.  They find the Oankali outwardly hideous creatures and thus cannot bear the thought of sexually desiring them.  A random side note: What if the Oankali were incredibly attractive aliens.  Would Humans still have been so reluctant to breed with them even though they would still be alien creatures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress.  Before finding out Jesusa and Tomas are siblings, Jodahs believed they were mates.  The two share a strong connection, similar to the ones Oankali siblings feel with each other.  When attempting to understand why Tomas and Jesusa did not care how they looked Jodahs writes, &quot;Perhaps it was because there were two of them.  If they were siblings they had been together most of their lives.  Perhaps they sustained one another&quot; (625).  This special closeness obviously becomes more like an Oankali siblinghood when Jodahs wants the two to mate with each other.  But something that struck me as even more prevalent in &quot;Imago&quot; was the Human sense of compassion.  Jesusa is shocked when Jodahs doubted whether they would stay with him through metamorphosis.  They want to do everything they can to help him through the process.  Akin&#039;s Human friends acted the same when he underwent his maturation.  These are Humans who have isolated themselves from Oankali way of life and yet they still have the urge to heal.  Not all humans need to be violent just like not all Oankali are genetically absolutely resistant to using violence.  The Oankali continually tried to draw a distinct line between their genes and Human&#039;s genes.  Their lives circle around the needs of the group so it makes sense that they would view Humans as one group of hierarchal species.  But they fail to realize that there are individual exceptions and these are illustrated through several of the Human characters in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Xenophobia on an interstellar scale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/185</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the works we have read so far, the series Lilith&#039;s Brood reminds me most of other science fiction books I&#039;ve read.  It has several things I feel to be typical staples of the SciFi genre, parts that are most often shared with other novels in the category.  These include the presence of an intrusive alien species, some great war that leaves our current perception of Earth in ruin, and advancement of human life and health through some means.  The most noticeable and most pertinent theme, though, is that of Xenophobia, one I feel plays out most often in science fiction books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler makes no attempts to hide the xenophobic tendencies of humankind in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  As we see with Lilith, the protagonist of the first book DAWN, after centuries of suspended animation interspersed with brief periods of isolated wakefulness is very quick to welcome the presence of a human being into her chamber.  She soon discovers that her companion is not, in fact human, and recoils away from him, noting that &quot;she did not want to be any closer to him.  She had not known what held her back before.  Now she was certain it was his alienness, his difference, his literal unearthliness,&quot; (13).  Lilith is African, a race most typically victim of xenophobic tendencies.  Yet even she finds the though of an alien being with humanoid but not completely human features to be utterly repulsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict is partly a superficial one, based upon the appearances of the Oankali.  They have humanoid, bipedal forms, but instead of eyes, ears, or noses, they have sensory tentacles covering much of their body, giving them the appearance of medusae.  Lilith even comments to Tate, the first person she awakens, that &quot;Oankali are ugly.  Grotesque.  But we can get used to them, and they won&#039;t hurt us.  Remember that,&quot; (131).  In other words, the Oankali&#039;s appearance is definitely a startling and scary point that drives humans away from them, but this is not all that is wrong, as it is possible for humans to adapt to their looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another human, Gilbert Roybal, reveals the true sentiment concerning the humans distaste for the looks of the Oankali Constructs and their sensory tentacles: &quot;It&#039;s not just the way the tentacles lookâ€¦. Yes, they are ugly, but it&#039;s what they represent that&#039;s important.  They&#039;re alien.  Un-Human.  How can little girls grow up to be Human women when their own sense organs betray them?&quot; (391).  The whole conflict is really about the fact that the constructs and Oankali are a whole different species apart from Homo sapiens, xenophobia on an intergalactic scale.  After all, there are tentacled beings on earth, but these are not as capable of intelligent thought as we are.  Yet the Oankali defy this norm, and other customs and mannerisms they have incorporate into one giant amalgam of foreignness that defies human categorization, making them something truly different and therefore frightening to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenophobia is a major theme in Lilith&#039;s Brood and other great works of science fiction like Ender&#039;s Game and later novels in the Foundation series.  This idea of being confronted by something so drastically different in appearance, behavior, and biology, yet with mental faculties and ideas similar to our own truly frightens us and necessitates exploration, and Butler does this well in Lilith&#039;s Brood.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anti-heroes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/184</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This book made me think entirely too hard about things I am not comfortable thinking about - what is human, what is free will, do humans really suck this much, etc etc etc.  Now that I&#039;ve finished, I&#039;m still stuck thinking about it, but I am having a difficult time grounding what I have to say in the text, or even articulating it in something approaching a coherent fashion.  I&#039;ll give it a shot, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing before I start:  Regardless of whether the Contradiction would lead inevitably to human destruction, refusing to help humans continue as humans because they will eventually destroy themselves â€“ because helping them would be like &quot;causing the conception of a child who is so defective that it must die in infancy&quot; â€“ is a little like demanding all fetuses be aborted because men are mortal and will die at some point, anyway (532). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really more of a fantasy than SF girl - I&#039;ve read more fantasy books, good and bad, than I care to admit.  Especially with high fantasy, the stakes tend to be pretty high â€“ set out on this quest to drop this ring in a fiery volcano or the world will end, journey into the mountains to awaken the dragons to save the kingdom, and similar.  (Side note: I know that there are exceptions â€“ I&#039;m running with standard structures here) The main character is often plucked out of obscurity, but because of one thing or another, they are in some way &quot;destined&quot; to carry out this task set to them.  The protagonist sets out on this journey knowing it will be long and hard, and the plot concludes with a great release of the built-up tension â€“ a crashing together of great armies, an epic battle with the evil lord, etc.)  The main character may start out as an everyman, but through his or her actions and words, it becomes clear that the protagonist is suited to the heroic lifestyle, so to speak.  I find it difficult to describe exactly what I mean, but hopefully this makes sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the science fiction books I&#039;ve read fit into this style, as well.  Some, like The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, do not follow this structure, but Offred is never set up to be a hero, never does anything particularly significant on a grand scale; that&#039;s the point of the book.  Lilith&#039;s Brood, on the other hand, repeatedly sets up a scenario perfect for the heroic structure â€“ the woman chosen to lead humans into a new world, the first human-born male construct, the first ooloi construct.  However, none of them are particularly heroic.  Though they never behave as proper, traditional heroes do, through smaller actions they manage to accomplish the same things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of Butler&#039;s protagonists really is an everyman.  Lilith, Akin, and Jodahs actions are dictated by their own and their companions&#039; everyday needs.  It is through these smaller actions that they manage to accomplish such extraordinary things.  They seem less unusual, untouchable, and heroic, and more like regular people who were put in extraordinary situations and managed pretty well.  It is easier for the reader to put themselves in their situation, to relate, and therefore erases much of the the Oankali alien-ness.  It brings out the humanity in the Oankali â€“ or perhaps the Oankali in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Lilith never accepts the role the Oankali give to her as the shepherd of humanity, but neither does she radically reject it.  She just rolls with it, because either radical action is too extreme for her, and it&#039;s easiest to take the middle road.  Even in the last paragraphs of Dawn, she still says, &quot;â€¦perhaps the Oankali were not perfect.  A few fertile people might slip through and find one another.  Perhaps.  Learn and run!  If she were lost, others did not have to be.  Humanity did not have to be&quot; (248).  She does not initiative to become un-lost â€“ that is the job for someone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further rejection of the traditional plot structure, there is no real climax to the trilogy.  The final scene of resistance in the mountain village is pretty anticlimactic â€“ the people have been subdued by Jodah and Aaor&#039;s healing abilities, and when the Oankali ship comes, &quot;there was no panic on the part of the humansâ€¦it was a measure of the Human&#039;s trust that they let Aaor and me and our mates go down to meet the newcomers&quot; (737).  Even the last Human holdouts are defeated gently, by the kindness (and chemicals) of the ooloi, and it is questionable whether they are defeated at all.  They are moving on to a better life on Mars, but they are still behaving as the Oankali want them to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end is ultimately ambiguous; the last sentence of the book, &quot;Seconds after I had expelled it, I felt it begin the tiny positioning movements of independent life,&quot; has no real feeling of conclusion to it (746).  Rather, it hints that life will continue on pretty much as it has through the entire trilogy, and it is through little actions and normal people that change will come.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 5</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/183</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to begin with a quote by Nikanj about humans, but really relating to everyone else but the ooloi, that motivates my whole understanding of the ooloi: &quot;Give them as much as they can take, and no moreâ€¦Start them slowly, and in only a little time, they will be more willing to give up eating than to give you up&quot; (678). I understand that the ooloi are biologically motivated to manipulate in this way, and can perhaps be thought of as amoral instead of strictly immoral. However, I think it is interesting to examine the relationship between the ooloi and their mates more closely, as simple as it may seem on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;
How does this relate to the commitment that the ooloi&#039;s mates show to it and the other partners in the relationship? On the face of things, it would seem that the relationship is purely biological. Lilith is first brought under the sway of Nikanj by his irresistible pheromones, as we find out in Imago, and it is likely that this and the pleasure Nikanj brings her have much to do with her remaining with it throughout the novel. Even though Lilith leaves at some points, she always returns. In any other novel, this would seem sweet; an expression of devotion, but in all likelihood, a large reason for Lilith returning is the irresistible physical manipulation of Nikanj. Nikanj could be seen as the center of its own little harem of genetically viable adults, gathering them to it for exclusively its own purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
I think that this is a quite simplistic analysis of what is in fact a much more complex situation. There is more than simple biology going on in the relationship between Lilith and Nikanj. This can be seen in several places. For example, Lilith does not blame Nikanj for the ooloi&#039;s screw-up with Jodahs and Aaor, that requires the entire family to go into exile from their home. She simply uproots her family and takes them away. Another example can be seen in the calm domesticity of the family&#039;s camp in Imago, when Jodahs brings the resister humans back. The ooloi manipulation can only extend so far. Nikanj does not command this sort of calm during all interactions, and his scent brings desire for him, and does not have any kind of explicit calming effect. There is clearly some sort of extra effect from being together as a family unit for so long.&lt;br /&gt;
Now all of this could be one manifestation of the exacting psychological control that Nikanj is also able to exert, but given the novel&#039;s emphasis on the biological imperatives of the characters, and its de-emphasis of the psychological roles, I think that it is more likely that the characters are actually committed to Nikanj, and to ooloi in general, in quite a devoted manner.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler&#039;s trilogy started with a bang, and ended with a whimper. The last part of imago seemed to me to be the most boring part of any of her books.  It also had the most Deus ex machina.  Of course the series is supposed to be SF, but most scenes were well explained.  It was never satisfactorily resolved how all of a sudden there was a fertile colony of humans around.  Somehow someone was raped and found to be fertile, but apparently she was the only one.  And that these fertile resisters had a hidden location where both other resisters and the oankali could not find them rang false.  The resisters had been searching pretty closely for other humans to raid, and they knew that people in hard to reach spots would be the most likely to be fertile, the resister raiders should have found the fertile village long ago.  There is a better reason why the oankali didn&#039;t know about the village, because they never actively searched out resister villages so long as they left others alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to my main point.  Octavia Butler&#039;s work seems to be filled with Deus ex machina.  While those scenes in imago were the most obvious parts, looking back through the work, there are many scenes where something happens just so that it will work out later.  Now of course, writers are allowed to do this to make their story turn out the way they want to, but there seemed to be too many coincidences which made the story slightly less believable.  In imago, meeting humans only a few days out of Lo was one such scene.  In Adulthood Rights, Akin being captured was another.  In fact, all of Akin was a coincidence.  Why were males so much harder to create than females never seemed accurately explained, and why Akin was the only one also seemed strange?  It seemed as if Butler wanted a hero who was unique and powerful to maintain interest, and so a normal rank and file oankali would not do, only a one of a kind construct.  Then, it turned out that he was to speak for the human race after being trained by an akjai ooloi.  It didn&#039;t seem like any other oankali received that privilege, but Akin did.  In the first work, there were also scenes which didn&#039;t ring true.  Almost all violent reactions to Lillith seemed strange to me.  These reactions appear constructed with second glances, because they don&#039;t seem to have any thought process behind them.  They were made to further the story rather than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler uses a lot of Deus Ex Machina to further the story, at least in my opinion.  Used in small doses, this can be helpful, but in too many parts of her story, it makes it ring false.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Oankali race metaphor</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/181</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oankali are a lot like Europeans/Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, I said it.  Certainly, it&#039;s not the only metaphor that can be drawn from the relationship between Human and Oankali in Lilith&#039;s Brood, but it&#039;s an interesting one to look at.  In light of the colonialist implications discussed in class, it&#039;s also one of the more obvious ones.  There is, however, a defined parallel understanding of Human-Oankali relations with regard to race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological understanding of value and character bears a striking resemblance to the sorts of arguments leveraged by White scientists for the last few centuries in an attempt to explain, and by explanation prove, the inferiority of Black intellect and emotional life.   So convinced are they of their own developmental superiority that they cannot accept the input of humans into their own fate.  They wait, instead, for the maturation of a child with Oankali genes, because even acknowledging their own inability to understand human culture, they&#039;re unwilling to build from the desires and opinions of the lesser species.  Even an immature, partial Oankali is given a stronger voice than fully acculturated humans, such as Lilith.  The humans play into this sense of superiority by fixating on the surface aspects of their life with the Oankali, such as their children&#039;s tentacles, and ignoring the more profound loss of humanity they&#039;ve experienced in a lack of meaningful freedom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motion of the narrative voice toward a more Oankali perspective also maps the acclimation of humanity (and Lilith in particular) to the Oankali world that they seem immovably stuck in.  By the end of Imago, Lilith seems to have given up any form of deep resistance, mired as she is in mothering the children she&#039;d originally resisted.  Her silent betrayal of Jesusa bespeaks a profound accommodation to the Oankali life that is now the vast majority of her existence.  Jodahs itself believes itself to be in touch with its human side, and to understand humanity through itself, but displays a lack of empathy with the humans it encounters.  It seems confused, and even perhaps disdainful of Lilith&#039;s attempts to keep bits of human culture alive; &quot;She does that sometimes â€“ insists on keeping human customs.&quot; (p. 528)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we take from this narrative of cultural subsumption?  Butler describes a universe in which humanity, in all of its cultural diversity, disappears into barbarism or alien existence.  As evidenced by reactions in class, readers find this prospect disturbing, and of questionable morality, if applicable.  In this removed form, we can question the medium-term effects of colonization without the cultural baggage of clichÃ©s so often implied in discourse on the topic.  In examining our own reactions to the Oankali paradigm, we see more profoundly what it is about humanity we do value.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lilith&#039;s Brood Respose</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/180</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class Monday and Wednesday I was surprised that no one brought up the biblical aspects of Lilith&#039;s Brood.  I know this a touchy subject, but there are so many references and similar story lines that I thought someone would have brought them up.  The easiest to point out is Lilith, who distinguishes herself in a religious sense both in name and action.  In Hebrew stories she is supposed to have been Adam&#039;s first wife, who would not submit to his supposedly male dominance (including during sex), and was thrown out of Eden for it.  Well, after this she decides to go hang out by the Red Sea, known apparently as being a hang out for all kinds of demons, and has over a hundred children a DAY with them before eventually being punished by God for her &#039;upstart, sinful ways.&#039;  Though this isn&#039;t exactly what Lilith is all about in Brood, there are similarities in the way she doesn&#039;t want to have sex with Paul Titus and is the first to really submit (however involuntarily) to Oankali reproductive practices.  On page 297 she even describes how the Resisters see her as &quot;a second Satan or Satan&#039;s wife.&quot;  I also saw a similarity between the first child she has and Mary giving birth to Jesus in that both were told after the fact, and it was somewhat unexpected at the time.  Both would come to celebrate their children, and both children (Jesus and Akin, and later Jodahs) would have some pretty unique ideas among both humans and Oankali.  Plus, who often left his Oankali parents and purpose to go wandering by himself before returning to spread the spread word of his recently stabilized healing and abilities, and briefly had a relation to a large water-dwelling organism?  Jodahs and Jonas maybe?  Eh, maybe a bit of a stretch.   Besides the names of the people was there any support that the town that Tomas and Jesusa came from had ties to Catholicism?  I remember there being a church in Phoenix but no mention of any church or faith in Jodahs&#039;s mates&#039; village past the usual references to &#039;devil Oankali.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>brain flashes on butler</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/178</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;K, first off, &quot;Bloodchild&quot; = creepy and not to be read right before going to bed, especially if one is particularly phobic about personal invasion by insects to begin with.  Personal nausea aside, though, the contrast between assimilating a species into one&#039;s own, and using the Other as purely breeding ground is fascinating.  &quot;Bloodchild&quot; made &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot; sit far more easily with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooloi--when I first saw the word, it looked very familiar, but I&#039;ve never read anything by Butler before, and poking around on the web, she&#039;s the only one who&#039;s meant to use the word.  It&#039;s not the pronunciation of the word that&#039;s familiar, it&#039;s the physical shape of it.  Can anyone shed any light on this?  It&#039;s driving me bonkers.  The OED offers a fascinating array of words that start with oo (a prefix which means having to do with eggs or ova, yay butler making up intelligent names!), but nothing looks familiar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot; is also referred to often as the Xenogenesis Trilogy.  Lilith&#039;s Brood is a far bleaker title.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith&#039;s myth-based history is fascinating.  Yay for &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/161&quot;&gt;Scott_of_the_Sahara&#039;s post on it.&lt;/a&gt;  My first introduction to Lilith was through Neil Gaiman&#039;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series, where he highlights Lilith&#039;s refusal to be sexually dominated by Adam, a motif that comes up again in a play that was put on here fall of 2004, &quot;The Lovesong of J Robert Oppenheimer.&quot;  The focus on sex that comes up with her, both in the above mentioned and in Scott_of_the_Sahara&#039;s post, with the seduction of men and the wantonness of spawning a demon race, is an interesting backdrop to the trilogy we just read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a comic series, &quot;Lucifer Morningstar,&quot; that&#039;s a spin-off of Sandman that I also kept thinking of during Lilith&#039;s Brood.  In it, the Lilim, her demon children, are one of three sides in the armageddon battle.  The three sides of a story instead of the traditional two plays out rather interestingly.  The series also deals a lot with the creation of new worlds and species and the responsibility that comes with creation and manipulation and birth.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>large blue men with fin ears = future enslavers of the human race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/177</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I watched a bit of this movie the other day, a 1973 French cartoon called La Planete Sauvage.  I only saw part of it because I got super creeped out by it, but the part that I did see was very reminiscent of Lilith&#039;s Brood to me. Humans are toyed with, what it is to be human is questioned, superior and uncaring aliens screw around with human lives, the whole bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you can find most of it dubbed over into English on youtube.  Watch it if you want to feel like you are on hard drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/maindetails&quot; title=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/maindetails&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/maindetails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First person alien</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/176</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Lilith&#039;s Brood trilogy, &quot;Imago&quot; is the first time we get a first person narration.  It&#039;s the voice of an ooloi, and therefore one of the most foreign to us in the world of the book.  This functions on several different levels.  It serves the utilitarian function of decreasing the number of &quot;it&quot;s in the text, making syntax more understandable overall.  But it also sets up a very interesting self-and-other construct, removing it from the societal and making it far more individual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, Jodahs is both the most alien and the most comforting character presented to us who has Oankali blood in it.  It is both Human and Oankali, and of a gender we have no concept of or parallel to within the human race.  There&#039;s this tiny part of it that is like us, but it is wrapped in so alien a package, thinks with so alien a mind, that it is hard to understand it.  The first-person narrative brings us closer to it, making it easier for us to sympathize with it on a level based in linguistics.  It is the only character we get to understand through its self, its own concept of self, as an individual, something that is very integral to our (the reading audience) concept of self.  There is an immediacy that is absent in the previous two books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have Jodahs as the first...mistake?  Throughout all three books, we hear all about how the ooloi perfectly craft magic little embryos that turn into the projected, desired offspring.  Yet for a society that seems so hell-bent on privileging nature over nurture to the point of exclusivity, it&#039;s interesting that the child gets to, in some respects, choose its own gender.   There is an implication in &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; that the Oankali constructs have far more freedom/ability to choose their own gender, and that, if they do not like their Human construct paired-sibling, they can choose to be of the same gender as the human construct, thus avoiding having to mate with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is echoed to a certain extent in &quot;Imago.&quot;  But in &quot;Imago,&quot; the human-born construct is the first one to turn ooloi.  Nikanj is torn between its own desires to have this same-sex child to help ease its loneliness, and the consensus of the Oankali, who fear this child.  At the end of the book, though, we find out that this is not an independent occurrence--there is another pair of siblings in a Jah village who are becoming ooloi.  &quot;This produced confusion among the people.  One mistake simply focused attention on the ooloi responsible.  Two mistakes unconnected, but happening so close together in time after a century of perfection, might indicate something other than ooloi incompetence&quot; (743).  This brings to mind several threads of thought.  One, when society is ready for something, it will happen.  Take Newton and Leibniz and calculus.  The nine different evolutions of the eye I learned about in high school also seems to fit in here (though poking on the internet seems to indicate that this is being refuted, and that the eye only happened once, and just branched like crazy).  It also brings to mind &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; when Dr Malcolm says &quot;Life will find a way&quot; and *poof* the dinosaurs start morphing genders so they can reproduce.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find most striking about this dual evolution of ooloi constructs, though, is that it shows a certain level of fallibility within the Oankali, who have previously been presented as infallible on the genetic level of understanding and manipulation.  They do not have the complete control over evolution that they like to seem to have to their &quot;trade partners.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we&#039;ve got these biological mistakes, specifically Jodahs, and it&#039;s the first person to speak to us in the first person, to have a true narrative sense of identity and individuality, and to offer us what seems like an unfiltered view into its mind.  With the human and the human construct, there was a narrator who could observe and speak for them.  With Jodahs, this is not possible.  Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Oankali are in their second consensus meeting, Jodahs tells the reader &quot;We represented the premature adulthood of a new species.  We represented true independence--reproductive independence--for that species&quot; (742).  In Jodahs, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  It has become a human-oankali-ooloi hybrid that in many respects overwhelms everyone who comes into contact with it.  It has a way with humans that wins over century-long resisters.  It succeeds where the Oankali fail.  And it can reproduce.  Until this point, even when the Oankali were reproducing with the humans, even when constructs formed second and third and fourth generations, there was still a purely Oankali ooloi involved in the process, controlling the process.  The humans weren&#039;t partners in a trade, they were subjects in an experiment, because the oankali still maintained ultimate control over the future of the humans, refusing to let a human influence penetrate the level of the final decision-making process in creating offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the three books, each begins with a birth of sorts.  Lilith is born into a new world.  Akin is born from the womb into the world.  Jodahs has a birth into a gender and adulthood.  The first time we hear from Jodahs, he is becoming ooloi.  Both it and Akin speak of the sensory perceptions, changes in taste and smell.  Lilith&#039;s birth is a gasping, a dimness, a struggle to see.  With each birth, there&#039;s an increased level of comfort with being born, a better understanding of what is happening, what is being experienced.  As understanding increases, the characters are better able to speak for themselves.  Lilith speaks to the Oankali, but they do not listen to her until things have gone terribly wrong, and she has proved her fears and wishes were valid.  Akin can convince the others of the necessity of an Akjai human colony without testing it first.  Jodahs speaks with its own voice from the first moment we meet it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making that which should seem so alien to us the only person who gets to use its own voice, the separation between that which is alien and that which is human is decreased, blurred.  Arguably, Jodahs is the most manipulative of all the people we meet, because it is human, oankali, and ooloi, able to understand both species, and to wield powerful narcotics, its mere presence winning its enemies to its side.  It should be the most repulsive character to us as humans, because it effectively destroys the resister urge, the desire to go to Mars and preserve humanity with its very presence.  Yet, narratively, we are put closest to it, made to understand it best.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t have a solid conclusion for this.  In some ways, this drawing in through the first person seems like it&#039;s meant to simulate being in contact with an ooloi, drawn in against one&#039;s will, desire, conscious choice, through subtle things like the use of &quot;I.&quot;  Like it&#039;s the closest we can come to understanding something that is truly alien.  Like we&#039;re meant to see ourselves as the alien.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the Oankali save the human race from extinction, it does not justify their manipulation and subordination of the species afterwards.  Now admittedly, if the Oankali had not come along, the human race would be dead, gone, no more people to stand around and be proud to represent what is &quot;human&quot;.  However, to be brought back with little control over your major life choices, with often the only alternative being suicide, is not a great second option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were not given the pretext that the Oankali saved the human race, there would be no doubt of their immorality (at least by our standards).  For the majority of the story, the humans are held on &quot;ships&quot;, and not allowed to go back to Earth until they have proven themselves loyal.  The Oankali maximize their slavery by making the human race entirely dependent upon Oankali for reproduction.  The humans who do escape and form resistance colonies are filled with sterile, desperate humans.  In Adulthood Rites there is finally a &quot;compromise&quot; which involves sending a pure human colony to Mars, but this does not give the humans a much more desirable situation.  If we were told of a race that would capture all humans, sterilize them, mate with them, and as a compromise send the only colony of fertile humans to Mars, I don&#039;t think their would be much argument over how justifiable that is.  The fact that the enslavement prevented the death of the species does not change the fact that it is enslavement.  As I pointed out in a recent comment, a good moral action does not justify a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would even cast doubt on how &quot;good&quot; the action of saving the human race was in the first place.  It seems to me that it was more of a coincidence of sorts that it was good moral action, for the Oankali were not rescuing humans because they felt it was the right thing to do, they captured humans for their own genetic purposes.  If instead the human race was about to fly off to some other galaxy all at once, the Oankali could have very well done the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oankali&#039;s actions cannot be justified morally, even if they are to be interpreted as advantageous to the human race.  The basics for our morals lie in the right to make a choice.  If I do something to you that others or I interpret as being ultimately beneficial without giving you a choice or asking your opinion, it is immoral.  It might not always get an objection, such as when Lilith learns how her cancer was removed, but it always warrants one, such as the resistors.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/174</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler uses dialogue throughout the book to say a great deal more than one would initially interpret.  She uses the Oankali and their projected image of omniscience to convey criticism of humanity and our civilization, even in situations where the Human culture is not specifically under scrutiny.  Less helpful to the story is her tendency to constantly ram the &quot;Human Conflict/Contradiction&quot; down the throats of her readers, yet never properly investigating just what is so flawed in it.  Because so much of the trilogy deals with the indoctrination of Humans or the raising and educating of children, there is a lot of room for explanation to the reader and we often hear the same situation explained from multiple perspectives.  This method of getting information to the reader is interesting because it points out the contradictions the Oankali are responsible for and the subtle manipulation and destructive lies through omission.  Much of the Oankali deception is only a suspicion until the third book, where the reader gets a very in depth view into Jodahs&#039; reality and how he twists people to match his will.  The concept of love in these inter-species relationships is completely dismissed, Lilith herself even says at one point that it&#039;s only a matter of pheromones, and that becomes absolute fact when we experience Jodahs&#039; perspective.  As far as Jodahs and Aaor were concerned it seemed not to matter at all which pair of Humans were chosen as mates, just that they found two warm bodies of roughly the right age.  Love is occasionally mentioned, but quite frankly it seems to exist more to point out just how ridiculous that concept is with the degree of control the Oankali and constructs have over the Human perception of reality, than as any kind of serious statement.&lt;br /&gt;
	One passage of Adulthood Rites that really stood out as saying more than it seems was when Akin and Tiikuchahk were on the shuttle to Chkahichdahk with Dichaan.  Dichaan allowed Akin to &quot;taste the ship&#039;s perceptions&quot; and then offered to do the same with Tiikuchahk (444).  Tiikuchahk asks its sibling whether or not it should also have this experience, as it had clearly been painful to Akin and it is Akin&#039;s response that is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.  &quot;Do it.  It hurts, and you won&#039;t like it, but there&#039;s something more in it than pain, something you won&#039;t feel until afterward.  I think maybeâ€¦maybe it&#039;s a shadow of the way it will be for us when we&#039;re adult and able to perceive directly.  It&#039;s worth what it costs, worth reaching for.&quot; (444)&lt;br /&gt;
This passage not only answers Tiikuchahk, but also answers how the Oankali, and constructs who are sufficiently swayed by the Oankali way, feel about hybridizing humanity.  From their perspective Humans should breed with them, sign over their free will and reproductive abilities.  It will hurt.  They will go against their better judgment and resent their own weakness â€“ not realizing just how little choice they had in the first place.  But the Oankali and constructs are convinced that the trade is the correct choice and in the end the Humans will understand that the preservation of even the remotest slice of humanity is worth losing all trace of what Humans had once been.  Even though Oankali explain throughout the book their reasons for the trade, their efforts to make Humans happy and save them from extinction, this passage seems to offer clarity of opinion that seems different from the more outright declarations in the book.  For some reason this statement, that is not even about directly about Humans, explains the essence of the Oankali reason for continuing to force themselves on humankind against their wishes because of a belief that the pain is &quot;worth what it costs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The future of the book (google talk)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So i attended the talk about the &quot;Googlization of Everything&quot; by Siva Vaidhyanathan, and wanted to comment on an issue which he addressed, and implied that other speakers had also addressed throughout the day.  That issue is what exactly will happen to the paper book in the future?  I have frequently had this argument with friends at home, and my stance is that the book will decline in popularity to the point that it is only used as a novelty item.  It seems that as more an more is loaded onto the internet, that books will inevitably follow the same path music is and become completely digital, with only a few exceptions.  &quot;Google book&quot; was an example I would site, but Siva examined the processes behind Google book, and seemed to show how its not as close as we like to think it is to being a universal library.  Searches will often bring up obscure texts, and it has yet to come close to the filtration level that an actual librarian can provide.  Also having a search engine determine how we find all of our information can be a very dangerous thing, for if it determines a text to be unimportant then it could disappear forever as &quot;result 10,453 out of 50,000&quot;.  Another interesting point was on how Google forms profiles on its users, and tailors its search results to what it interprets that user is looking for.  An easy situation to imagine in which this could be corrupted would be if a user&#039;s profile labels him or her as a political extremist one way or another, and then filters results to only include points of view that fit within that political extremism, perhaps preventing that person from branching out.  It seems that a universal library is not nearly as easy to compile responsibly as I thought&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/171</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just realized why Octavia Butler wrote Imago in the first person.  It is ridiculously hard to write a compelling sentence about Jodahs, when you constantly have to refer to it as &quot;it&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Aliens Like Shakespeare, Too</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/170</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As a humanist leech, I sometimes feel left out of certain SF authors&#039; visions of the future. In Starship Troopers, disciplines like philosophy are entirely ceded to the sciences--viz. the constant references to &quot;mathematically verifiable moral truths.&quot; And this is to say nothing of the uses of mimetic representation--a curious absence, given that such visions of the future are made via a sort of mimetic representation. We talked in class about whether there was art on Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness. In Lilith&#039;s Brood, Butler explicitly states that there isn&#039;t art among the Resisters. This comes up when it gets revealed that, prior to the war, Gabe used to be an actor by profession. What&#039;s particularly interesting, though, is the way aesthetic experience gets linked with the tactile communication that takes place between constructs and Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Akin clearly has no idea what it means to be an actor. He describes the phenomenon of performance art in descriptive terms that turn out to be sort of alarming: &quot;Gabe had been an actor. People gave him money and goods so that he would pretend to be someone else&quot; (408). Aside from basic cultural miscommunication, Akin&#039;s objections to Gabe&#039;s acting look, at first, pretty Platonic. &quot;&#039;Didn&#039;t your mother ever tell you any stories?&#039; [Gabe] asked Akin. &#039;Yes,&#039; Akin said. &#039;But they were true&#039;&quot; (408). Here, Akin&#039;s idea is that fiction--or, probably, any other form of mimetic representation--is not a useful endeavor because its empirical falseness renders it a less good way to communicate between persons information about human-/Oankali-nature, the given world, etc. Plato, of course, makes this objection in Book X of the Republic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dovetails unsettlingly with the state of utter destruction that has been wrought on Earth by this time in the novel. &quot;&#039;She never told you about the three bears?&#039; &#039;What&#039;s a bear?&#039;&quot; (408). This perspective shift renders impotent Akin&#039;s attack on acting as well as Gabe&#039;s defense of same. At a certain point, the biological mandate to survive trumps any sort of demands that aesthetic objects impose on us. Art pales in the face of death--or, in this case, extinction. I take this to be a really useful observation that perhaps SF authors, in general, are in a better position to make than other fiction writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabe&#039;s performance of Lear for Akin is described simply as a transformation: &quot;Gabe became an old man&quot; (408). Despite his initial reservations, Akin has a powerful experience of empathic substitution: &quot;Somehowâ€¦he felt what Gabe seemed to want him to feel. Surprise, anger, betrayal, utter bewilderment, despair, madnessâ€¦.&quot; (408). A wide range of the human experience suddenly becomes available to Akin, and he experiences it immanently. It&#039;s an incredible fact about art that it can make subjective experience communicable between persons; that it should also do this between species says something about the real (potential) power of representation in the universe of Lilith&#039;s Brood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, when Akin attempts to describe to Gabe his experience as an audience, he describes it as being similar to a form of communication unique to the Oankali: &quot;It&#039;s like what we do--constructs and Oankali. It&#039;s like when we touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (409). There might not be a better way to paraphrase the purpose of art than to say it&#039;s &quot;talking with feelings and pressures.&quot; The humanist tradition, it turns out, survives, albeit in a semi-recognizable form. But that seems to be a theme in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Morality in Lilith&#039;s Brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/169</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We spent a large part of our in-class discussion on Lilith&#039;s talking about the morality of the Oankali&#039;s actions toward humanity.  They were described as immoral, amoral, devious.  What I think Lilith&#039;s Brood shows us is that what we, as humans, think of as absolute morals are actually incredibly slippery and ephemeral things.&lt;br /&gt;
	The resisters reject living with Oankali because they refuse to mate with the Oankali, regardless of the pleasure it provides, regardless of the fact that doing so is the only way that they can propagate their genes.  For them, to create half-breed children is worse than the possibility of never having children at all, to create constructs is unnatural, immoral, and the ultimate betrayal of the species.  They refuse to be anything other than human, regardless of what human means.  But as the years progress on earth, humanity seems to become something not really worth aspiring to, for no other reason than the fact that their existence is meaningless, and they know it.  At one point, Tate admits to Akin &quot;We don&#039;t get old. We don&#039;t have kids, and nothing we do means shit&quot; (402).  Eventually, the main characteristic associated with humanity becomes violence.  Men rape, pillage, kidnap and kill.  Even the more civilized members of Pheonix start using guns and resort to raiding other towns.&lt;br /&gt;
	The resisters hold so strongly to this moral imperative that they not only kill others, but allow themselves to die.  Many resisters with correctable medical conditions refuse Ooloi treatment, one of Akin&#039;s captors would &quot;cut his own throat before he let one of those things touch him again,&quot; even though they could cure him of the ulcer that kills him (328).  Since the Ooloi are so preoccupied with healing, they will, and biologically need to, treat anyone unwell they are presented with, and would therefore do so, even for a resister, yet none seek treatment.  They feel they must hold their moral ground, and this makes them suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;
At this point, their resistance just isn&#039;t worth it any more.  They may be avoiding betraying their species in their minds, but they&#039;re causing much more harm that the Oankali ever did, and for that reason, they&#039;re acting more immorally than Lilith or any of the other humans with Oankali mates.  Though clearly our biology tells us that it&#039;s absolutely immoral to allow the extinction of the species, if being human means raping and killing other humans, then trying to propagate the species is itself immoral.  Through this, I think Lilith&#039;s Brood shows that there are so such things as absolute morals.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>whoah!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/168</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just finished the book, and I&#039;ve just got to voice my first emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE HELL??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the weirdest thing I&#039;ve committed to reading.  EVER!  The whole book the roll of the ooloi wasn&#039;t portrayed ambiguously.  You never quite blamed people for acquiescing to their wishes, because it was never exactly clear that the ooloi were truly manipulating their emotions beyond the human&#039;s control.  Yet, in the last 50 pages of the book it becomes painfully clear that the role of ooloi is to change the behavior of partner species in a trade.  There is constant reference to how the ooloi scent pacified the humans, and only minor rationalizations that the scent opened human minds to truth.  But, then what happens?  They start a new colony, and people are apparently excited about it, because of the advent of construct ooloi.  What does this mean?  Does this mean that the Oankali have won?  Have they effectively domesticated humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>there is a fine line...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/167</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting oxymoronic concepts in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  Throughout the series, the Oankali mention that the Human race is full of life and death, horror and beauty.  Simultaneously, Lilith notices the subtle ways the Oankali treat the Humans.  Their imprisonment isn&#039;t actively aggressive, but it&#039;s an aggressiveness hidden in kindness.  &quot;And they had done it all so softly, without brutality, and with patience and gentleness so corrosive...&quot; (67).  Also, when the ooloi and the humans are fighting, Lilith describes it as &quot;gentle chaos.&quot;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trend I noticed is the fascination with pleasure and pain.  The ooiloi definitely have an interest in both pleasure and pain, and Lilith, also, &quot;perversely&quot; enjoys the pain of aching muscles (146).  When Nikanj induces &quot;time together&quot; between Lilith and Joseph, it is both a painful and pleasurable experience.  &quot;Now their delight in one another ignited and burned...They seemed to rush upward...&quot; (162).  This experience is soon followed by pain: &quot;Her first solitary sensation was pain--as though she had been shouting, screaming&quot; (162-163).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, I guess there&#039;s just a fine line between all these things, which could be an extension of the moral ambiguity we&#039;ve been having trouble understanding.  How much of the Oankali&#039;s intentions are for the benefit of their race or ours?  Is their philanthropy completely altruistic? We don&#039;t get to know what the Oankali really think, which is part of the problem.  Either way, I&#039;m still wishy washy on what I think.  However, Nikanj&#039;s statement on page 153 really captured my attention: &quot;We...do need you...In a very real way, you&#039;ve captured us, and we can&#039;t escape.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Somthing I was thinking about</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/166</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Blag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime I wish SF could be a little more realistic.  No, not the actual science.  It&#039;s either realistic or not, but I can usually get over that.  What I mean is that no one ever does anything boring in SF.  It would be a nice change of pace.  I mean, I have been up to my neck in work for the past two weeks.  But there has never been anything like that facing any of the main characters in most SF.  Never does there seem to be boring large amounts of work, or boring scenes. The closest you get in Lilith&#039;s Brood is where she is being trained to learn the skills she needs.  Even then though, Octavia butler skips past most of those parts.  While it helps maintain the intensity of the work and keep it flowing, I think it also divorces us from what Lilith actually went through.  Without even one scene in which Lillith is being trained, it is hard to form any empathy about her training, and the need to train the other humans in  those same skills.  The only author in SF that I can think of who actually pulls boredom off is Vernor Vinge in his novel Deepness in the Sky.  There is a scene in that book during a long space flight, and the author manages to convey the boredom by showing a few of the mundane tasks undertaken by the protagonist, while still keeping the book moving along because the tasks were useful.  In fact, the scene is a welcome respite from action.  Lilith never seems to ever pause in her action, and it makes a few scenes harder to relate to.  Especially after she was first awakened, it seemed as if she was always doing something.  Though it was described later as a very boring and trying time, while she was experiencing it, the reader only got the slightest intimation of hardship.  This made it harder later on to really emphasize with Lilith.  And that was a nice break from all the work I have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Different Direction for Darwin</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/165</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As we were talking about the role of genetics as well as how to determine some notion of species-based superiority (&quot;should humanity cede their future to the Oankali&quot; being one of the key discussions in these books), I started to realize that watching Alien would be an excellent avenue to have a similar discussion but in a very different direction. The xenomorph is an interesting counterpoint to the Oankali, because one can make many of the same arguments from Lilith&#039;s Brood about biological superiority, yet the arguments sound somewhat more preposterous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Oankali, the xenomorph&#039;s reproduction involves humans, albeit in a considerably more violent way--the Oankali constructs do not burst their way through the chest of their parents. The key distinction, of course, is that reproduction is essentially all the xenomorphs do with their lives, lacking all other signs of intelligent life. Since aliens are often defined by their supposed &#039;superiority&#039; in some way to humans (everything from the logic of the Vulcans to the enormous city-ships in Independence Day), the xenomorphs represent a species whose superiority is for once completely distinct from the intellect. As Ian Holm&#039;s character states, the alien is &quot;a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the xenomorph is &quot;superior&quot;, as we like to phrase it, to humanity in the arena of physicality, but the deep and fundamental questions that we&#039;ve been asking ourselves about humanity and the Oankali seem to just bounce off this alien species as ridiculous. Why is it that when we read about the Oankali&#039;s advanced science, we start thinking that maybe we&#039;ve had a good run and its time to toss in the towel, but when we see the Alien ripping through people, climbing on walls, and spraying acidic blood, we just cross our fingers that Ripley will find some way of killing this thing? Why do we consider intellectual evolution as a force beyond our control, but physical evolution is just a reason to design a bigger gun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. As an additional fun avenue of discussion, there&#039;s a quote from Ximena Gallardo, who wrote a book called &quot;Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley&quot; that I thought someone might want to run with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It [the xenomorph] subdues and opens the male body to make it pregnant, and then explodes it in birth. In its adult form, the alien strikes its victims with a rigid phallic tongue that breaks through skin and bone. More than a phallus, however, the retractable tongue has its own set of snapping metallic teeth that connects it to the castrating vagina dentata&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Genetics in Science Fiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/164</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After the brief discussion about genetics in class on Monday, I figured I&#039;d talk about my understanding of the genetics involved and how they would affect Oankali form and society. Although our current understanding of genetics limits our engineering methods to basically linking one gene to a single protein or trait, it&#039;s become pretty clear in the last decade that our genome is much more complicated than that--we are exponentially more complex than a fruit fly, for example, but we have less than double the actual number of genes that a fruit fly has. Clearly, although the physical complexity must be genetically derived, it cannot be purely explained by our current understanding of genomics. Given that, I think it&#039;s fair to allow Butler some wiggle room on the capacity of the Oankali to engineer particular personality traits--things like aggression, caution, violence, sexual drive, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
We seek to assign moral or societal values to the behavior of the Oankali. In particular, their drive to &quot;trade&quot; with species after species seems appalling to us; they seem to genetically pillage other species, imposing their own biological and societal forms. However, attempts for us to place a moral judgement upon that behavior are essentially inappropriate. This drive is a subtle, genetic one; just as we have a basic drive to reproduce on a genetic level, the Oankali enact this sort of genetic colonialism because of a desire, a need that is fundamental to them. To judge them for it is the same as judging humanity for seeking sex.&lt;br /&gt;
The differences between humanity and the Oankali are even more extreme than first appears. Although they appear largely human when amongst us, it must be remembered that their original form was closer to a sea urchin or jellyfish than an ape. Societal forms and moral strictures forming in such a different species would be truly unknown and potentially unknowable to us; the Oankali are truly and completely foreign, from a genetic level up to the extrapolated society, and we must keep that in mind when considering their motives.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drugs and Choice</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/163</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We talked a little bit in class on Monday about the morality of the Oankali.  One of the examples used to make the claim that they are immoral was their lack of concern for the human concept of choice.  Because the Oankali can read into your heads (sense, read, whatever), they have an uncanny ability to know what humans might REALLY want.  Obviously, Joseph&#039;s reaction to ooloi sex is one such instance.  An even more disturbing example is Nikanj&#039;s assumption that Lilith wants a child when she is ready, instantly looking into her thoughts and saying, &quot;I mixed a girl to be a companion to you.  You&#039;ve been very lonely&quot; (Dawn 246).  Obviously, as humans, this strikes us as immoral, partially because it overrides our ability to choose some of our most basic desires--sex, child, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I think it&#039;s really interesting that drugging reappears in Adulthood Rites: not with humans, but between Oankali themselves.  The instance that caught my attention the most is the fight between Akin and the two Construct siblings.  Although Akin initially protests, the girls take him and hold &quot;him between them and put him to sleep...He understood what they were doin and resisted them angrily at first, but they were right...He knew [that he could get them captured], and they could feel his contradictory feelings.  They knew he knew.  Thus, there was no need to argue....He accepted it finally and allowed them to send him into a deep sleep&quot; (Adulthood Rites 395).  This brings up a whole new side to the issue of choice, and I think it&#039;s a good argument for the Amorality rather than the IMmorality of the Oankali.&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t think they were ever trying to destroy the humans&#039; lack of choice: obviously, they made some decisions that we instinctually label as wrong.  However, they were simply acting on their own moral system, drugging the humans as they did each other.&lt;br /&gt;
However, does this make it right? Is it ever possible to judge something completely alien to yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>sexuality &amp; power dynamic in lilith&#039;s brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/162</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, I really enjoyed reading this book; in my opinion it does a far better job of presenting an alternative view of gender than Left Hand of Darkness did. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d necessarily want our civilization to evolve in this direction gender-wise, but clearly Oankali society functions quite smoothly even with a lack of duality. The message is that this kind of functioning is possible for us. Lilith&#039;s Brood is a feminist work in the best sense because it promotes and presents a model of true gender equality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the ooloi or &quot;third&quot; gender, who are both male and female integrated, seem to wield most of the power and influence in Oankali society, They take the primary role in procreation and are respected as &quot;treasured strangers&quot; (pp.106). The female Oankali follow just behind them in status, and the males are actually the calmest and most passive. Ultimately, however, an Oankali&#039;s gender is of little consequence; though ooloi, those of the gender that would be most unfamiliar to humans, are the ones specifically bred to work with humans.&lt;br /&gt;
The structure of Oankali society forces the reader (and the human characters) to confront and accept functional androgyny, and possibly even respect it. It is interesting that even with this degree of control and extra ability, ooloi are still called &quot;outsiders&quot;; perhaps to gradually get the reader audience used to such an idea? I&#039;m not certain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved how among the Oankali, sex is not demonized, it is embraced, and yet made very scientific at the same time. Sex is &quot;shared&quot; rather than being &quot;had&quot;. Possession has nothing to do with it; the experience is either sensual and about pleasure, or neutral and merely biological. The process of maturing sexually has an almost-sacred significance and is referred to as a &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. Oankali do not have a separate set of sexual organs; sensory arms are &quot;very flexible, very versatile, but only another limb&quot; (pp.110). Oankali do not struggle with sexuality and obsess over pleasure to the same degree that humans do, and yet, it is what they live for in a way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part of the gender model in this book that maybe doesn&#039;t work so well is the &quot;demonizing&quot; of the human male. I&#039;m sure that most human men probably would go a little bonkers after not having sex for months, but I doubt that it would drive them all to violence and total dehumanization of women in their minds. In other words, Paul Titus bothers me. It&#039;s interesting that the Oankali treated two humans the way that we treat animals today; put &#039;em in a cage and wait until they mate. However, what do animals do if they don&#039;t want to mate? They just don&#039;t! No killing or injury involved. I think that human men are being deliberately portrayed as &quot;out of control&quot; but it&#039;s an unfair generalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a conversation between Lilith and Tate Marah, the first woman that she Awakens, where many interesting things show up:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Who are you Awakening?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Leah Bede and Celene Iver.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Two more women? Why don&#039;t you wake up a man?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I will eventually.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;You&#039;re still thinking about your Paul Titus, aren&#039;t you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;He wasn&#039;t mine.&quot; She wished that she had not told Tate about him.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Awaken a man next, Lilith. The guy who was found protecting the kids.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;On the theory that if you fall off a horse, you should immediately get back on?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Tate, once he&#039;s Awake, he stays Awake. He&#039;s used to ordering people around. He can&#039;t save us or protect us but he can damn sure screw us up.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;So what, you&#039;re going to wait until you can Awaken him to a kind of harem?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Tate seems to be driven by typical female desires: the wish to be protected, and sexual desire. Lilith is thinking of the whole group and who will be the most useful, not worrying about her own ability to function sexually. However, they are almost turning some tables and treating the man in question like an object, an animal who would be unable to control himself simply because he is outnumbered by women. This is an interesting experiment to look at, but it is basically reverse-sexist, and probably wouldn&#039;t work so well in our human society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Liliths - Response 5</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/161</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My reaction to Lilith&#039;s Brood after just reading the title was to think, &quot;Lilith! What a terrible name for parents to give their child!&quot; I didn&#039;t know too much about Lilith, other than that she was supposed to be the first wife of Adam, according to apocryphal texts, and that she supposedly killed children. From where I was coming from, that didn&#039;t seem like the best name for parents to give their daughter, although I was intrigued as to how the choice of name would play out in the three books. For instance Tino, upon hearing her name, remarks that it is an &quot;unusual name loaded with bad connotations&quot; (285). I have to agree, although it could very well be that he is just referring to the stories he as heard about Lilith Iyapo. Nonetheless, many of the stories of Lilith Iyapo have interesting parallels with various stories of Lilith. So, I it would be a good idea to read up a little more on the background of Lilith and the various stories surrounding her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that she was much more than just the child killer and first wife of Adam that I had originally thought and that many of the earlier traits ascribed to her are clearly reflected in the character in the text.  In early Sumerian texts she was a demon who would visit men in the night and have children by them. This notion of her as a child bearing demon continues into the Talmudic period where, according to Raphael Patai, she was unhappy as Adam&#039;s first wife so she fled and went to the Red Sea where she &quot;engaged in unbridled promiscuity, and bore  a demonic brood of more than one hundred a day&quot; (Patai 296). Woah!  A brood! Lilith&#039;s bearing of a demonic brood relates very well to the perception of Butler&#039;s Lilith by the resisters.  Lilith herself raises the objection early in Dawn, terrified after learning how her children will no longer be human, she fears that the Oankali will &quot;make mules of our children sterile monsters&quot; (55). The resisters see the children as just that, monsters, the demon brood, and they perceive her children as the end of the human race. They are not human and they are the ones who are going to repopulate the planet, not the human race which the Oankali claim to have been saving. Having been previously unaware of this aspect of the story of Lilith, I thought it was very interesting that the title seems to suggest there is possibly something demonic, or at least unhuman, about her children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith is also concerned with childbirth. According to sources cited by Patai, women would recite certain incantations to protect themselves from the complications that she could cause in child birthing. In fact, it was possible for her to cause sterility. In a way resistors blamer her for much of what has happened. She is there Judas goat (245) and it is because of her, or at least can be seen to because of her, that the human race will no longer survive. The human race is now sterile without the Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also texts which tell of Lilith as being the wife of Samael (Patai 308).  Where Adam was, at least, human, Lilith is now the wife of a demon. The Oankali in the minds of the resistors? And here again there is the fear that they might fill with world with &quot;their demonic brood&quot; so God takes it upon himself to castrate Samael. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels with the different religious and mythological Liliths and the role of Lilith Iyapo as seen from the resistors point of view was an aspect of Dawn and Adulthood Rites that I thought was very interesting, especially not knowing much about the history of Lilith. The demonic aspect of her through history and her demonic children who threaten to fill the world, fit well with the fears of the resistors who believe that the construct children are not human and yet they will be the ones to inherit the restored Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the link to the article I read which does a great job tracing the changes of Lilith:&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Art, Culture, and Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/160</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oankali in &lt;em&gt;Lilith&#039;s Brood&lt;/em&gt; are distinctly alien, in many ways â€“ but the difference which persists longest and is most troublesome is their culture â€“ or apparent lack thereof. The Oankali apparently take the view that biology is everything â€“ that, given the scale of a group of humans throughout a lifetime, the genes they have within them ultimately decide the fate of the entires species. They believe that they can predict the lifestyle of the children their ooloi mix before the children are even born. But this sort of dramatically confident view is also one-sided: it ignores the existence of culture, the influence of society, and what Hobbes calls &quot;the Social Contract&quot;. The Oankali perceive a predictability in humans&#039; genetic makeup that persists whether the humans exist in a &quot;state of nature&quot; or not. Granted, the behavior of the humans we see in the book seems &quot;nasty, brutish, and short&quot; except on account of the intervention by Oankali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also suggestions that the Oankali view is not all-encompassing. The Oankali claim that the &quot;Trade&quot; with humans is in part an exchange of cultural practices â€“ but it doesn&#039;t seem like the Oankali have a culture outside of their biology. They have no written records â€“ in fact, they do not wish for Lilith to have writing implements intially, either â€“ but instead rely only on their infallible memories. They have no tradition of fiction, myth, or lying. The closest they come to art is in the shaping of new creatures to serve their needs â€“ and even that seems painfully utilitarian. And even though they claim to be interested in human culture, they really seem to fear it. Take this episode, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:1em; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding: .5em;&quot;&gt;&quot;The music would soon either drive the storytellers into one of the houses or, more likely, bring them into the singing and dancing. Oankali did not like music. They began to withdraw into the houses â€“ to save their hearing, they said. Most constructs enjoyed music as much as Humans did. Several Oankali-born construct males had become wandering musicians, more than welcome at any trade village.&quot; (Butler 439)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oankali willingly walk away from human culture, ignore it as best they can. They have no use for it. The reasons for this aren&#039;t clear: but my best guess is that it&#039;s not biological enough for them. It is as if the Oankali&#039;s ability to perceive biology so completely blinds them to the worth of non-biological practices. Their ability to communicate directly to one another through sense-tentacles could be related: Akin admits that acting at least is &quot;like when [the Oankali and Constructs] touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (Butler 409). Actually, this description of acting resembles Ursula Le Guin&#039;s explanation of fiction as a method of &quot;describing certain aspects of psychological reality in the novelist&#039;s way, which is by inventing elaborately circumstantial lies&quot; (&lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, Introduction). So if fiction is a method for abstractly conveying difficult information, then Constructs should have no need for it, and in fact this is true. But at the same time, the Constructs enjoy music as much as humans. And even though natural Oankali are not musical, what the Ooloi do is &quot;almost like making music â€“ balancing endorphins, silencing pain, maintaining sobriety... Ooloi made great harmonies, interweaving people and sharing pleasure&quot; (512). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Oankali, then, biology does not simply replace art; biology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; art, and other forms of art are unnecessary. They do not partake in the trade of books and paintings, and they seem to scarcely acknowledge their value, even though they also claim that human culture is greatly significant. In the end, it may be significant because it is the one aspect of humans they least understand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>this was meant to be a respone...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;...This was meant to be a response to the long thread of comments on the entry titled, &quot;The extension of human masculinity,&quot; but it became this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to watch people get so riled up about gender in class.  I understand that some people believe it&#039;s a social construct and that stereotypes are evil, etc. etc., but I think that this belief in gender and the stereotypes attached to each one is so deeply ingrained, that there&#039;s no point in arguing aimlessly about it.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m maybe not going to make any sense when I try to explain this, but I&#039;m going to try... So in my Lit Theory class today (or yesterday, technically speaking), we were discussing Nietsche&#039;s and Frost&#039;s ideas on metaphors.  Metaphors are so common in our everyday language that we don&#039;t even notice them anymore (ie. &quot;She&#039;s a warm person.&quot;  Life as a journey can be extended to the statement &quot;I&#039;m lost.&quot;).  Ultimately, metaphors stabilize and give meaning to our perceptions by helping us understand things in relation to other ones.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Left Hand of Darkness and Lilith&#039;s Brood, the metaphors are the references to gender that the authors make.  Here&#039;s one to refresh your memory: &quot;Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit&quot;(LeGuin 12)&lt;br /&gt;
While I do not doubt that authors like Butler and LeGuin may be trying to provoke us with these gendered non-gender beings, maybe they&#039;re also just providing supposedly male, or supposedly female attributes, so that WE, as readers, can engage in and better understand (and maybe even empathize with?) these aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Resistance</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/158</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m about two-thirds of the way through &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; now, and while &quot;Dawn&quot; seemed to focus a bit more on the alien aspect (the Oankali) this second part seems to shift towards the humans, both resister and &quot;trader&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, a majority of the humans of Lilith&#039;s Brood are really not that unusual...they like to build and create, they like their individuality and freedom, and they have their squabbles and disagreements.  The little town of Phoenix is a prime example of this, and it is quite easy to draw parallels to our own societies and history from the descriptions given of this town (Butler 345).  And it is hardly surprising, considering that these people are attempting to restore the old world that they had lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is both surprising and absurd how these people can still refuse to give up their &quot;humanity&quot; as they call it.  Alright, so maybe it seems like the people would be giving up their humanity by going to the Oankali...what with bearing offspring that possess traits of both....and anyone with a bit of sense would be hesitant to trust such a situation.  Really....who would want to completely change the way humanity lives and reproduces at the drop of a hat...no questions asked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it would seem that in &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, choosing humanity over the alien has even worse consequences.  The people of Phoenix are no longer able to reproduce and force themselves to steal or buy stolen children in order to avoid &quot;going with them&quot;.  In such a society, the people are prone to hurting one another...a prime example being when Tino&#039;s parents tear apart Tate&#039;s home to kill the raiders (355).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the people of resister towns such as Phoenix are either slowly dying without hope of offspring or killing each other off over various grievances.  Oddly enough, this draws parallels to the war that started it all....with humans of all sorts killing each other.  In a way, this is the Oankali versus the humans in another war that could tear the world apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder really....wouldn&#039;t these people have learned their lesson already?  I mean, they nearly killed everyone once as it is....why continue on a path that could repeat this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe the answer, while not entirely clear, is something not unfamiliar.  That concept of humanity...the xenophobia that inhabits nearly all human beings to some degree (though we may not express it).....  That fear of the different that causes Lilith so much trouble getting used to Jdahya in the beginning of the trilogy...  Simply because we use appearance as an indication of allegiance, these humans fail to see some of the reason the Oankali put forth (though I will say that I&#039;m still not 100% sure about them).  This same feeling which causes racism and stereotyping....which causes humans of all kinds to make decisions without knowledge or reason.  A terrible thing, but one that we cannot be totally rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have not finished the trilogy, I do not know what this feeling will cause....will all humans eventually accept the Oankali or not?  Guess I&#039;ll find out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>alien colonialism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/157</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my reading of &quot;Dawn,&quot; I found myself torn between where my sympathies should lie.  The Oankali seemed compassionate enough and Lilith&#039;s relationship with Nikanj struck me as genuine and surprisingly not creepy.  And yet it is difficult to trust the motives of a group of creatures that put humans asleep for centuries and then keep them trapped in a ship.  There were moments when Lilith&#039;s resistance annoyed me and then at other times I was shocked by her ability to cohabitate with these seemingly grotesque features.  I continually put myself in the position of Lilith and I was forced to acknowledge that I would not be nearly as brave or patient as her.  Being the only human among alien creatures is indeed a terrifying concept.  There was much criticism of Lilith&#039;s decision making in class and I have to argue in Lilith&#039;s defense.  I believe she went above and beyond what the majority of humans would have done in her situation.  Curt may be a brave man in the sense that he is absolutely determined to lead his life away from the Oankali.  But he is also foolish because he never gives the Oankali a chance to prove themselves as decent creatures.  Ultimately I realized that Lilith was such an appealing candidate to the Oankali because she was strong, intelligent and more importantly, open-minded.&lt;br /&gt;
 	Should the Oankali have forced the humans to cross breed with them?  No.  Do I understand why they did it?  Absolutely.  It would be ludicrous for anyone to claim that if a ship full of alien creatures landed on Earth tomorrow, we would not conduct numerous tests on them.  We would of course be fearful but our curiosity would overrule.  I am clearly more hesitant to say that humans would have any desire to mass procreate with them but I would not be surprised if there was some attempt at isolated cross breeding.  The Oankali are naturally very curious creatures.  They are simply fascinated by the race of humans and are eager to save them and then start a future with them.  While they are not open about all their intentions in the beginning, they are incapable of actually lying.  Akin &quot;had always found it easy to tell the truth and difficult to make himself lie&quot; (351).  Humans cannot boast this need for the truth.  &quot;Humans, on the other hand, lied easily and often.  They could not trust one another.  They could not trust one of their own who seemed too close to aliens, who stripped off her clothing and lay down on the ground to help her jailer&quot; (238).  While the Oankali hope to see the good in everyone, humans are  constantly doubtful.&lt;br /&gt;
	Within the first few chapters of &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; I had my mind set in favor the Oankali.  This is not to say that they did not make mistakes in their handling of the humans.  This is also not to say that they should serve as the epitome of morality.  But I do believe they are a more sophisticated race than the humans in many ways.  They display an inherent goodness that the humans simply don&#039;t have.  One must only look at how welcomed Tino was into the Oankali tribe in comparison to how carelessly and in fact violently the group of nomads treated baby Akin.  His presence excited many humans in Phoenix but this was only because they had desired a baby for so long and at least this one was normal looking.  And still, several of the humans are repelled by Akin because of his gray tongue and thus connection to the aliens.  They refuse to see the Oankali as a race in any way equal to them.  The fact their survival is thanks to these aliens means little to them.&lt;br /&gt;
	I found the story of the merger between the Oankali and the humans as a twisted version of extraterrestrial colonialism.  Here, the humans are essentially the savages who need to be taught how to inhabit the Earth.  However, the Oankali do not behave like traditional colonialists.  They do allow the humans to build their own villages; albeit with the knowledge that they can never have babies.  Rather than exerting violence on the humans, they give people like Lilith defense mechanisms against the humans who will most likely attack her.  This is because they understand humans&#039; inclination towards violence.  Akin describes how the nomads &quot;did hit each other occasionally.  Twice, a pair of them rolled in the mud, punching and clutching at one another.  Even when they did not fight, they cursed each other and cursed him.&quot; (334)  Two centuries after destroying the world through violence, humans still cannot resist the urge for physical aggression.  And yet they still carry the strong need to love and be loved.  Iriarte has great trouble letting Akin go because he reminds him of one of his children.  This is why the humans&#039; dilemma is so problematic and why it is ultimately so difficult to choose sides.  I believe that the humans need to recognize the flaws that almost killed them before and at least attempt to understand the creatures that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>yay Akin</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/156</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler&#039;s &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, among other things, is an extremely thorough exploration of morality.  Firstly, it challenges the emotional connection to morality by creating a situation where standard sympathy for characters doesn&#039;t necessarily reflect who has the moral high-ground.  A lot of books use sympathy for the characters to give an impression of the moral situation.  However, in this book, it&#039;s nearly impossible to determine whether events are ethical, because the characters that those events affect are both human and alien.  For the humans, my sympathy center works fine, but the Oankali are presented as such a truly alien species that it seems nearly impossible to understand the reasons behind their actions.  Though the book attempts to give some insight into the machinations of the Oankali mind, especially in &quot;DAWN&quot;, it&#039;s very hard to pin down exactly how they think.  For that reason, the same reason I don&#039;t judge a crocodile for attacking a person, I find it difficult to judge the Oankali, and find it difficult to sympathize for them.  Any sympathy analysis of the situation yields a bias towards the humans that may not necessarily be fair.  The notion of a people who are motivated by the incorporation of new genetic material into their society is so completely foreign that my ethical sense becomes irrelevant, and I can only analyze the inter-species conflict intellectually.  This presents a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
How does one analyze intellectually an emotionally based subject like ethics?  This question has strange relevance to the world that has been presented in &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, because it derives ideas from both human and Oankali thought.  For the humans in the story, moral right is a very subjective and emotional issue.  It&#039;s clear that the decisions and moral convictions that humans make are based on their emotional state, which frequently includes fear and resentment.  These lead to convictions, which demonize the Oankali, and lead the more radical elements of Phoenix to believe that cosmetic surgery on construct children is a moral imperative.  On the other hand, the Oankali see morality very scientifically.  They have incredible insight into the genetic foundations of life, and for that reason they are able to analyze the core of different organisms&#039; actions on their most basic level.  When analyzing the human genome, the Oankali see a conflict between the hierarchical nature and intelligent nature of human beings, which they believe to be a fatal flaw.  Because the Oankali perceive organisms to be merely the sum of their parts, this flaw seems inescapable to them.  Since their society is morally motivated by genetic diversity, they see modifying the human race, and effectively eliminating the flawed genes, as the obvious ethical solution.  Letting the human race continue to propagate in its current state seems would be a crime.  When Akin is asked why the Oankali wouldn&#039;t help humans settle on Mars, he explains that, &quot;The only thing that would be more terrible would be to murder you all with my own hands.&quot; (502)  He goes further to explain the Oankali position, saying that &quot;You can&#039;t see and read genetic structure the way they do.  It isn&#039;t like reading words on a page.  They feel it and know it.&quot; (502)  The Oankali moral positions are driven by analysis of a perception which is near scientific.  The fact Oankali, which are all provided with similar information, come to a consensus on this moral issue shows that their moral reasoning is deterministic, and not subjective.  This divergence in ethical reasoning between humans and Oankali turns the earlier question to something different: how does use Oankali reasoning to analyze human ethics?&lt;br /&gt;
I believe the character Akin was made for the purpose of making the aforementioned question answerable.  He gives the most exposure to the Oankali type of thought, but at the same time, he is the most human of the constructs.  This gives him a perspective, which allows him to use his Oankali reasoning, but also address the emotions which are important to human moral reasoning.  Ultimately, he comes to the conclusion that there is a lack of symmetry between the two species, and that humans deserve an independent equivalent to the Oankali Akjai.  He realizes that the nature of Oankali necessitates symbiosis with other species, but he also is very aware of the injustice of forcing the human race into extinction in the process.  Ultimately, he shows that moral justice between two societies necessitates balance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>saving humans</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/155</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were discussing in class whether or not humans deserved what the Oankali were doing to/for? them, there was something floating in the back of my mind: early on, I think it is Jdayah that tells Lilith about saving her and the others. He says that they rarely interfere with a species&#039; self-destruction because the species usually wants it--but they interefered with the humans because they knew not all of humanity was ready to die. Obviously the first question is how did they know this since they obviously have difficulty understanding people. Second, if humanity actually did want to continue, then what the Oankali are doing is not helpful. They are changing humanity. By creating hybrid children of both the humans and the Oankali, humanity is still being destroyed, in a way. Whether this is better or worse is obviously arguable, but certainly Lilith&#039;s child will not be purely human. So my question is, how can the Oankali say what they&#039;re doing is saving humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Cohesison in Lilith&#039;s Brood: Dawn</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/154</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really a criticism of Butler&#039;s work, but an observation I&#039;ve been mulling over for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I&#039;ve finished Dawn and am working through Adulthood Rites. Like most of you, I&#039;m doing so through the format of the Lilith&#039;s Brood omnibus edition that collects all three novels. But reading this all consecutively offers a different experience than what one would get by reading the novels individually; for instance, reading Dawn on its own and getting to Adulthood Rites later. And I&#039;m very curious what impression one would get from reading the three novels as individual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audience raised on pop culture and genre fiction generally expects narrative cohesion; that everything get resolved, or at least have a clean break from one unit in the series to the next. Though the universe&#039;s story is not completely settled, the individual plot threads of the novel are usually tied up to the point where the conclusion at least feels satisfying. Consider recent examples like the TV show House ( though House is still messed up, the medical mystery of the episode is solved, and the patient in question goes off into the sunset ), the Harry Potter novels ( each book chronicles one school year, a clear start and end to that book&#039;s adventure ), and distinct story arcs in comic books that are later collected in complete trade paperbacks ( though the overarching story of a series like Preacher or Y the Last Man continues, each collection offers a complete narrative ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn, however, followed an opposite trend. The ending of Dawn does offer a significant change-- Nikanji impregnating Lilith with the dead Joseph&#039;s DNA-- but it&#039;s really just a continuation of the larger problem that Lilith faces. Since her awakening, the Oankali have been meddling in her affairs to a ridiculous extent, using their seeming omniscence to determine what&#039;s best for her, only answering her questions when they want to, and altogether robbing her of the ability to choose her own fate. Lilith is obviously ambivalent to this, as any sane person would be, but the aliens don&#039;t relent-- they modify her gene structure, they determine what time and place she&#039;ll be,  they throw upon her the responsibility of being the leader to the Awakened humans, etc. And the final scene doesn&#039;t resolve anything, it just confirms the fact that Lilith is the prisoner of these benevolently tyrannical aliens. Just because they sensed that she was alone and wanted a child doesn&#039;t give them the right to put one inside her without asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t a problem when the work is read in one seamless volume, but if I were to read Dawn independently, I&#039;d probably be frustrated; not so much by the cliffhanger ending, but the fact that Lilith has made no progress whatsoever, and is still the Oankali&#039;s puppet. Given what they&#039;ve done to her, almost any good will she may have towards the aliens strikes me as the onset of Stockholm&#039;s Syndrome...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as power for the ooloi</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(This started out as a reply to two separate posts, but got rather long and wandered off a bit on its own argument, so I&#039;m posting it independently, but referencing the posts that inspired parts of it where applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to CZ and his assertion that the Oankali are definitely alien in &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/152&quot;&gt;his comment to roseblack&#039;s post&lt;/a&gt; --I&#039;m not going to argue that there is a direct correlation between every aspect of the Oankali and humans.  Lacking my own tentacled ooloi, I&#039;d be a bit hard pressed.  I will, however, argue that there are many parallels to be drawn between them and us, particularly pertaining to gender.  That is, if I can be trusted to not be apparently inherently manipulative self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151&quot;&gt;As CZ stated in own blog&lt;/A&gt;, the Oankali are not in the moral right they wish to see themselves inhabiting (a self-delusion to which humans themselves are prone).  Taking the argument one step further, they themselves are a hierarchical society, both internally with the submission of the males and females to the ooloi, and in the way they treat humans, who they claim they want as partners in an *equal* trade, instead treating the humans as pets, as Lilith herself explicitly notes when Nikanj first shows her off to the other Oankali its age (54).  One would be hard pressed to argue that the Oankali do not treat the humans as lesser beings than themselves.  There&#039;s a clear power dynamic present, in favor of the Oankali.  Power dynamic implies hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this seemingly inter-species conflict translate to gender?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, it doesn&#039;t.  There is a whole lot being said about race here.  The different races of the humans are mentioned, but not dwelt on because there is such a huge gap between human and oankali.  But there are clear parallels to gender within the power dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, though, I would like to point out that Butler was born in America (right here in LA, actually), and lived here during her life, and she specifically sees her work as commenting on the Western construct of race, and implied, greater Western societal situation.  I will point you in &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.sfwa.org/members/butler/&quot;&gt;this direction&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point into her biography and what she has to say about her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roseblack brought up the idea that, while less graphic and traditionally violent than our society&#039;s concept of rape, or the flat-out rape attempts portrayed in the book, Nikanj rapes Lilith when it impregnates her in a comment replying to Count Zero&#039;s comment to the original roseblack post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some etymology.  In Middle English, rape meant to do something hurriedly.  By the fifteenth century, though, the word took on the meaning &quot;The act of taking anything by force; violent seizure (of goods), robbery&quot; (noun) and &quot;To rob, strip, plunder (a place). Also used with a group of people as object&quot; (verb) (OED online).   Fundamentally, rape isn&#039;t about sex.  It&#039;s about exerting power over another individual against the other person&#039;s will, power over that person&#039;s body, somehow objectifying that person, and doing this through a means that, nowadays, involves sexual organs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the book.  Regardless of how many different individuals&#039; genetic material Nikanj manipulated and melded and modified to impregnate Lilith with some &quot;perfect&quot; embryo, it is Nikanj who decides that Lilith should be impregnated, without her knowledge or consent, taking control of her own body away from her for its own purposes.  Additionally, this happens just after the humans have realized that, without their knowledge or informed consent, the ooloi have taken away the humans&#039; ability to have any physical contact with one another without extreme discomfort and revulsion.  Additionally, they have rendered the humans sterile without their consent.  The ooloi have manipulated the humans so that the ooloi have complete and utter control over the bodies of the human, control over the humans as objects, and they manipulate the objects sexually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lilith fends off the attempted rape of Allison, she says &quot;There&#039;ll be no rape here...Nobody here is property.  Nobody has the right to the use of anybody else&#039;s body...We stay human.  We treat each other like people, and we get through this like people&quot; (178).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oankali, especially the ooloi, do not abide by this.  The rhetoric of Nikanj made my skin crawl.  It says to Lilith, when discussing the problems that occurred by bonding with the humans before they were sent to the proto-forest, &quot;&#039;But most of us couldn&#039;t wait&#039;...It wrapped a sensory arm around her neck loosely.  &#039;It might have been better for both our peoples if we were not so strongly drawn to you&#039;&quot; (202).  Nikanj is placing the blame for fucking up the humans ON the humans because the humans were just too damned attractive to the Oankali for their own good.  Were the humans all running around in short skirts, asking for it, too?  The Oankali see themselves as indisputable superior to the humans (again, in creeps hierarchy), and thus somehow, the failings of the Oankali are not entirely their own fault.  Later, when Joseph is killed, it&#039;s because the oankali underestimated humans.  There&#039;s an implication that humans, without anyone to moderate them, and too impulsive, violent, and weak-willed for their own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the second time Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj have sex, Joseph says &quot;No!...You said I could choose.  I&#039;ve made my choice!&quot; to which Nikanj replies &quot;&#039;You have, yes.&#039;  It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment from him.  When he would have backed away, it held him.  It managed to lie down on the bed with him without seeming to force him down.  &#039;You see.  Your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (189).  Um, rape much?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#039;s not something inherently male or female, either on the victim or victimizer&#039;s side of the equation.  In our own society, yes, there&#039;s a tendency for certain genders to act against others, but it&#039;s not a rule, and there are certainly cases of women raping men, men raping men, women raping women, transgendered people raping and being raped by other transgenders, men, and women.  It&#039;s not something inherent to any specific gender.  Certain types/pairings get more coverage and/or happen with more frequency, based on population size, societal expectations that people live down to, the comfort in acknowledging what happened as rape.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the ooloi male in this instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When push comes to shove, however much we want to skirt around it, when it comes to humans, you&#039;re sterile, you have functional sperm, or you have functional eggs and a functional womb.  As far as the propagation of the species goes, this is it.  While the oankali have their own system of procreation, when they interbreed with the humans, they adopt and must work with certain aspects of human procreative anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the ooloi be seen as a neutered medical professional?  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of a movement to brand fertility specialists as rapists, or inherently male.  The oankali assert throughout the text that they use organic matter the way we use machines.  So why aren&#039;t the ooloi just cold, clinical medical professionals, using internal labs, probes, and turkey basters instead of synthetic ones?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s because they do not give their patients/hosts/victims a choice in the matter.  And, ultimately, in taking the genetic material, blending it, and then placing it in the womb, the ooloi are serving a function that, while more complex than traditional male fertilization in humans, achieves the same end.  Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child.  Without the presence of sperm, the gumball&#039;s just going to roll right out the machine at the end of a woman&#039;s menstrual cycle.  Is the maleness of the ooloi increased by the sensory arms?  Yes.  The imagery is certainly there to be interpreted as phallic at will.  But we don&#039;t know exactly *how* the embryo is inserted.  It&#039;s after Joseph&#039;s death, so not during sex.  The implication is that Nikanj implanted it sometime after Lilith had healed it and was herself recovering.  Again, kinda sketchy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that, because it creates the embryo, the ooloi is actually functioning more as a female.  Really long fallopian tubes, maybe.  It just doesn&#039;t ring true for me.  I think what really drove the masculinity of the ooloi in procreation home for me was, on page 246, when Nikanj tells Lilith she&#039;s pregnant--&quot;I have made you pregnant with Joseph&#039;s child.  I wouldn&#039;t have done it so soon, but I wanted to use his seed, not a printâ€¦And there&#039;s a limit to how long I can keep sperm alive.&quot;  This passage struck me far more as Nikanj being a conduit for the passage of sperm, taking the place of Joseph (male) because Joseph and Lilith were no longer able to touch one another.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, CZ said, in response to roseblack, &quot;It actually designs the genetic code for its offspring, and as an afterthought returns that design to the female&#039;s body.&quot;  The fact that, even though it has the genetic code, it CANNOT go through gestation, sets it up as male, compared to our base of knowledge and underlying biases going into the book.  It&#039;s not so much an afterthought as an apparent inability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&quot;You&#039;re going to have a baby and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; (roseblack)&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Now that is a far better point, but less directly male. The Ooloi do serve the role of determining birth time (as men did before the advent of birth control in more developed countries, and still do in less developed ones) but it is a subtle, finely tuned, and ultimately stronger dominance than simple penetration.&#039;(CZ)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#039;re arguing that the ooloi are hyper-male, super-male?  Unless there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing.  And while, yes, birth control can prevent birth, on the flip side, some aspect of a man is still necessary to *create* a baby if a woman so desires, so it really is rather impossible to completely remove one gender or the other from procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, not to be discounted, there IS a history of patriarchy in our society, like it or not.  On some respects, the ooloi are neutering the men and turning themselves into hyper-men when it comes to the process of procreation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the second book, it becomes explicitly clear that the ooloi have rendered the &quot;pure&quot; humans sterile to force assimilation with the oankali, or die out as a race.  They say, though, that they have given humans a choice.  It&#039;s not much of a choice, though.  And it completely disempowers humans as individuals, taking away their ability to create their own future.  This has both racial and gendered overtones to it, but seemed worth bringing up at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the ooloi always male?  No.  Compared to how humans are portrayed in the book, all of the oankali have impressively fluid personalities, independent of gender.  I was actually rather struck by how abnormally black and white the treatment human gender was, comparatively.  Perhaps it&#039;s more that there ARE gender distinctions among the humans, whereas they oankali are portrayed as more of an overall group, perhaps because they are the Other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, in the particular instance that roseblack initially spoke of, directly regarding the ooloi&#039;s role in reproduction, the ooloi is given a role of dominance over every other type of creature in its society and human society.  In this specific act, the ooloi is treated as male, when seen through the filter of our own society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The extension of human masculinity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/152</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting that, in a book that goes so far to break out of gender relations as we know them, and which re-defines what male and female mean, we&#039;re confronted with a society in which the very different set of gender roles and norms is defined by the inserter of genetic material being highly dominant.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hierarchy and the Oankali Contradiction.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My first reactions to Lilith&#039;s Brood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Heriarchy is not a genetic trait.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The Oankali (especially Ooloi) manipulation of humans is immoral.&lt;br /&gt;
3) The Oankali are no more moral than humanity, since both are driven by supposedly inescapable genetic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Hierarchical behavior is too complex to be purely genetic. Unless Butler can point to specific evolutionary pressures that would cause such a trait to occur, I&#039;m going to have to call bullshit on that whole idea. Without that specifically ingrained trait, there is no reason for the Oankali to render all humans sterile (until Jodahs) without an Ooloi. Without that trait human behavior could simply be re-trained. The Ooloi are spectacularly effective manipulators, after all. (I&#039;ll ignore the biological impossibility of heirarchical behavior being genetically inherited in my subsequent points, and instead examine morality in Butler&#039;s universe, where this is true) And that brings me to my second point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Despite the supposed genetic predisposition of the Ooloi to find new things, to heal them, and to bring them in line with their own idea of morality, I think that their extended manipulation of humans is morally suspect. The Oankali as a race, and the Ooloi in general, do not treat humans as if they have any level of choice, and simply manipulate them. They assume that the humans do not have choice because of their biological contradiction, and the Oankali assume they must choose for Humanity. The way that Nikanj uses Lilith, using it&#039;s own pheromones to bind her tightly to it, without telling her about the side effects (She can&#039;t touch Joseph), is presumptuous to the extreme and, I believe, morally wrong. Even worse is Jodahs&#039; unwillingness to tell his soon-to-be mates the same facts, despite seeing how hard it is for his human mother, Lilith, to deal with what Nikanj did to her. He assumes he knows what&#039;s best, he assumes it will be OK, but really all it is is biological greed driving him. Which brings me to my third point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Here&#039;s the Oankali Contradiction: They believe they have the right and the ability to choose for humanity, because humanity is biologically flawed, and the Oankali can &quot;correct&quot; that. But the Oankali themselves are driven by an immensely powerful biological need, that manifests itself in a particular set of morals. These morals are thus no more pressing, no more valid than the supposed lack of morals that the humans exhibit. Both are driven by biology, in this world, and so what we see in the end is a triumph of Oankali biology over human biology, instead of the morally righteous triumph of an angelic race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-CZ&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine from high school is getting press for creating a program that writes love poetry.  Here&#039;s a link to the online story for anyone interested, I thought the idea of mathematically generated poetry might open some new avenues for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Limits of the Imagination</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/149</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ursula Le Guin paints a world in her book &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, that is almost impossible to imagine, and that&#039;s what makes it so interesting.  Le Guin&#039;s alien world of Gethen is one of perpetual winter, filled with a people much like our own.  The primary difference between our species and theirs is that they are all of a neutral sex, with the exception of a few days a month, where they decide which sex they want to be.  This difference seems silly, and almost impossible to us, for the duality of male and female is so ingrained in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the main alien character, Estraven, is first seen, it is in the context of a large parade with the nation of Karhide&#039;s king.  A &quot;king&quot; that is without, and with no desire for, a queen.  Estraven serves as the sort of &quot;right hand man&quot; of the king, giving advice to Genly, the male protagonist earthling.  It is virtually impossible for us to imagine these characters initially as anything but male.  There is absolutely nothing resembling sexual tension between Genly and Estraven in their early interactions, and it seems no different than any interaction between two males.  The social positions occupied by many of the characters are those that we would typically associate with male, such as a &quot;king&quot;, and so we have to constantly remind ourselves that the characters are actually gender-neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Guin&#039;s use of masculine pronouns for all the characters makes it even harder to break out of the normal male image.  This appears to be an issue Le Guin was trying to avoid, as a future short story called &quot;The Winter&#039;s King&quot; about the same world was published with both all male, and later with all female pronouns.  However, the decision to use &quot;he&quot;, no matter its intentions, again forces the reader to constantly remind themselves of the true gender neutrality of the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologically it is easy to understand why it would be so hard for people to grasp this concept.  If I asked you to think of images of ten different women, and then of ten different men, it would not be a difficult task.  However, if I were to ask you to picture ten different gender-neutral people, it would not be easy at all.  The concept of being both and neither gender at the same time is like nothing we encounter in our everyday lives.  Le Guin challenges us to imagine an alien race that is just like us, and yet far from us at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if it wasn&#039;t hard enough to imagine how the humanoid aliens looked, their lack of gender comes along with a lack of sexual drive.  Le Guin seems to tie this lack of sex drive to other properties of the culture, such as its slow technological advancement, and its utter lack of wars, of even the word war.  Lets be honest, no sex drive, technology rush or war? Sounds like a pretty boring world.  The inhabitants of Gethen lack the motivation to improve their technology past what they believe they need, as shown with their centuries old heater design, which could easily be improved upon, but it is felt that it is good enough.  Video games will never be as good as they could be, and cars will never be as energy efficient as possible.  The satiety with life is a concept that humans cannot relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of Gethen is similar to ours on the surface, but radically different underneath it.  Le Guin challenges our imaginations like no other author I have ever read, and sheds light on just how ingrained some concepts, such as sex, are.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Winter and Gender</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/148</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there is a divergence in opinion in our last class about the roll of gender vs environment in the qualities of the planet winter.  I just wanted to give a little bit of input about that subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that, while the harsh climate of this other world does have a significant effect on the people, the book uses the lack of gender as more of a differentiator.  For example, a lot of people seem to think that the difficult living conditions are what prevents war.  However, I believe that this condition would cause the exact opposite effect.  Limited resources have been at the root of most wars.  Where are resources more limited than on an ice-planet?  Instead, I believe the lack of fullblown war is a commentary on the male element in our societies.  This may sound like a cliched perspective, but I think that it is an interesting thought experiment, regardless.  As a male, I&#039;m fully aware of the compulsive emotions for self-sacrificing courageous deeds and posturing aggression.  These emotions are mostly irrational, but from just looking at the current state of political affairs, it is clear how significant they are in the public mind.  However, on winter, as there are no gender roles, half of the population isn&#039;t biologically programmed to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the tribe and their children.  Without this irrational undercurrent in society, war is never possible, because no one is willing to commit themselves to anything more that a &quot;foray&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Y - The Last Man</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&#039;s a comic book series called &quot;Y - The Last Man&quot; that&#039;s actually pretty related to the topics we&#039;ve been discussing lately. But unlike Left Hand of Darkness, which shows us a world where the two sexes as we know them have been sort of combined, this series shows us a world where one sex just ceases to exist. &lt;!--break--&gt;The story is about an English major named Yorick, and his pet monkey Ampersand, who are (apparently) the last remaining male mammals on planet earth after a catastrophe instantaneously wipes out all the others. Here&#039;s the description from the back of the first chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 4em&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Unmanned World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/2469/ythelastman00132ii4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid #888888&quot;/&gt;In the summer of 2002, a plague of unknown origin destroyed every last sperm, fetus, and fully developed mammal with a Y chromosome (with the apparent exception of one young man and his male pet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;gendercide&quot; instantaneously exterminated 48% of the global population, or approximately 29 billion men. 495 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are now dead, as are 99% of the world&#039;s landowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States alone, more than 95% of all commercial pilots, truck drivers, and ship captains died... as did 92% of violent felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally, 99% of all mechanics, electricians, and construction workers are now deceased... though 51% of the world&#039;s &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; labor force is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 nations, including Spain and Germany, have women soldiers who have served in ground combat units. &lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt; of the United States&#039; nearly 200,000 female troops have ever participated in ground combat. Australia, Norway, and Sweden are the only countries with women serving on board submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, all women between the ages of 18 and 26 have performed compulsory military service in the IDF for at least one year and nine months. Before the Plague, at least three Palestinian suicide bombers had been women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, 85% of all government representatives are now dead... as are 100% of Catholic priests, Muslim imams, and Orthodox Jewish rabbis.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&#039;m not sure if the &quot;29 billion men&quot; statistic is meant to be 2.9 or if it&#039;s referring to the male mammals also exterminated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series presents a pretty interesting view of what would happen. There&#039;s a fair amount of comic-book-ized material, like the badass secret agent who helps protect Yorick, and lots of somewhat cheesey, somewhat witty dialogue... but it&#039;s good. Some interesting phenomena that pop up: the &quot;Amazons&quot;, a cult whose philosophy is that men were punished and that the world is better off; Congress faces issues putting itself back together, because the remaining members are overwhelmingly Democrats, which the remaining ones see as unfair. Oh yeah, and there&#039;s less sex than you&#039;d think, because as it turns out, Yorick is trying to find his fiancÃ©, who was studying abroad in Australia when the Plague hit - unfortunately, it&#039;s not easy for anyone to find a boat or an airplane after the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Interpreting an Origin Myth</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/146</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to talk about the Orgota Creation Myth (p.237), because I think the origin myth that a genetically engineered people come up with is an interesting notion (and one that you could only pull off in sci-fi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I find it interesting that there is neither a single omnipotent God figure, nor the dual Adam and Eve figures, but rather 3 &quot;creator&quot; figures. Perhaps the idea here is to emphasize that what we see as &quot;no gender&quot; is in fact its own gender, so while we see the people of Winter as oscillating between androgyny and the male/female binary, the people see themselves (through their myth) as having 3 distinct states of being. It&#039;s worth noting that the 3 creators have 3 responses that could be ascribed to our own conceptions of the genders of Winter. &quot;I bleed&quot; and &quot;I weep&quot; could be seen as representing violence and emotion, which are generally split along the male/female binary (though if you really started analyzing bodily fluids as metaphors, you might see the two switching roles), while &quot;I sweat&quot; implies a purely physical response to the world, devoid of gender or sexuality. I think its impressive that LeGuin is capable of using language at its least flowery, as most myths demand, to still get across the complex sexuality (or gender, whatever the proper term is) of Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is also not without its interesting quirks. It is the first man, not the creators, who force snow and winter upon the world. The first man also kills 37 of the 39 people the creators made, which seems unusual for a world that cannot conceive of war (although personal violence is not quite as challenging a concept). Then the story ends by breaking a few major taboos--a house of corpses, and brotherly love in the most literal sense (and interesting companion piece to Chapter 2 on p. 22). Also, as we are all focused on the binaries and duality of the story, the myth ends with a declaration that the people of Winter find themselves in &quot;the middle of time&quot; (239), with shadows (I think blacklace went into some detail on this particular topic) reminding them of the eventual destruction of light and the permanence of winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, there seems to be a substantial commentary on the perception of sexuality of the people. On one hand, the three states of being are all seen as equally important towards creating the world; on the other hand, kemmering is referred to as &quot;burning&quot; (by corpses, no less), and the general species is born out of incest, which would imply that sex is not seen as a pure act by any means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other aspects of the story (inherent violence, avoiding the binary with respect to time) also merit discussion, I&#039;m sure, but I find the somewhat contradictory roles of sexuality and gender seem particularly interesting (even more so since they appear in an origin myth meant to summarize the entire culture).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>language and meaning in the left hand of darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/145</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness may be about gender, and it may be about weather, but it&#039;s also very clearly about the schism between words and real world referents. The vocabulary that LeGuin uses to describe this poststructuralist phenomenon is &quot;veneer.&quot; This comes up first during the description of Argaven&#039;s jingoistic speeches, in which he advocates for war without, we are told repeatedly and in a way that starts to grate by the end of the book, being able to say the word &quot;war.&quot; Ai points out that it&#039;s interesting, then, for Argaven to be so concerned with notions of capital-T &quot;Truth,&quot; given the fact that his oratory consists in large part of deception: &quot;He talked a great deal about Truth also, for he was, he said, &#039;cutting down beneath the veneer of civilization&#039;&quot; (102).&lt;br /&gt;
	This pretty much sets Ai off. He really does not, evidently, appreciate hearing Argaven talk about truth or, we find out, about &quot;veneer&quot;: &quot;It is a durable, ubiquitous, specious metaphor, that one about veneer (or paint, or pliofilm, or whatever) hiding the nobler reality beneath. It can contain a dozen fallacies at once&quot; (102). Genly Ai&#039;s complaint, then, is that the &quot;veneer&quot; argument--the argument about an obfuscating something-or-other that&#039;s always blocking from view the true nature of things--is itself a bit of empty rhetoric, something that nobody if pressed is really sure what to make of. Here, Ai proves himself wrong even as he delivers a deft criticism. There is, clearly, an obfuscating something-or-other, a &quot;veneer,&quot; but it has to do with language; with metaphor, perhaps; with one&#039;s ability to say what one means; not with, as Argaven too-broadly claims, &quot;civilization.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The book gives two very elaborate and drawn-out examples of how language comes to obscure meaning. The first of these is the concept of &quot;shifgrethor.&quot; LeGuin throws out a lot of made up words to stand in for objects and ideas in the community of TLHoD, but this is the only one that strikes me as sort of ingenious. The only definition of &quot;shifgrethor&quot; we are ever given doesn&#039;t really completely square with how the word gets used in conversation between characters--but this is perhaps because the term is only obliquely defined, is defined as, in a sense, indefinable--&quot;prestige, face, place, the pride-relationship, the untranslatable and all-important principle of social authority&quot; (14). Great. So we have a narrator who&#039;s in the unique position to tell us that there&#039;s an &quot;all-important principle&quot; that governs everything going on in the weird universe of this book, but who&#039;s also totally unable to really accurately say what it is or what it might mean in practice. It turns out usually--though definitely not always; &quot;shifgrethor can be played on the level of ethics,&quot; too (106)--to mean something like the secret rules that govern conversation, something like etiquette. The conversation at Genly&#039;s dinner with Estraven--which is the ostensible context and impetus for Genly&#039;s first defining &quot;shifgrethor&quot;--gets revisited several times in the book, with the common realization between the two characters that neither really had any idea at the time what the other was saying.&lt;br /&gt;
	The other salient example is the phenomenon of mindspeech, which is, of course, alien to Gethen, but which Genly Ai introduces at least to Estraven. The experience turns out to be wildly uncomfortable for Estraven, whose socially ingrained mode of communication involves what Genly Ai charitably calls &quot;reserve&quot; (255). The idea is that all Gethenians are going to hate mindspeech because it doesn&#039;t allow for falsification, for the sort of rhetorical play that &quot;shifgrethor&quot; necessarily entails. This tells us two things: (1) socially, and specifically with respect to Gethenian cultures, lying is a lot more comfortable than telling the truth, and pure meaning sort of sucks; and (2) objectively, throughout the universe of TLHoD, it&#039;s the transmutation--transubstantiation?--of ideas into words that allows for the fucking up of meaning.&lt;br /&gt;
	Genly Ai observes all of this about Gethenian culture. He observes that obfuscating rhetoric is absolutely the cultural norm. He also points out one really weird counterexample--of Kundershaden, the prison, he says: &quot;[i]t is what it looks like and is called. It is a jail. It is not a front for something else, not a faÃ§ade, not a pseudonym. It is real, the real thing, the thing behind the words&quot; (166). Aside from the fact that this seems to be making a sort of stupid and demonstrably false assumption about how language signifies, what I find really interesting here is that the only physical, cultural counterexample that Genly seems to be able to hit upon is a prison. I&#039;m not really sure what to make of this. In his experience, the only thing that is cold and hard and not covered up by the play of language is the locus of state power.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>response 4</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/144</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed The Left Hand of Darkness. It was a pretty entertaining novel for me - the journey across the Ice was a bit of a bummer because too much of it was devoted to purely describing them pulling the sledge across various areas, but other than that, it was good. I liked the political intrigue, the numerous backstabbings and the excitement that comes from following two characters who are running for their lives. However, after reading this novel as an action/adventure sort of story, I realized that I had not really thought about the impact that the androgynous nature of the Gethenians has on the meaning of the story. During my reading of the novel, I felt like this did not have that great of an effect on the overall story. After all, the biggest issue in the story was Genly Ai and Estraven&#039;s efforts in securing an alliance between Gethenians and the Ekumen. The androgynous nature of Gethenians was mentioned throughout the story, but it seemed more like a side note than anything else, as if it was briefly touched upon during breaks in action before being forgotten again. Now, after reconsidering the story after having read it, I realized that the androgynous nature of Gethenians does have a great effect on some aspects of the story. I guess ultimately the effect of having androgynous characters is to shock readers out of creating gender roles for genders. In my opinion, Le Guin accomplishes this specifically by continually referring to Gethenians as &quot;he&quot;. By doing this, she can lull readers into thinking of all Gethenians as men before writing about some feminine characteristic of a character that will contrast greatly with the image that the reader has built up to that point. This effect happens notably throughout the story. In one memorable instance, the king becomes pregnant. So, not only are Gethenians mainly referred to as &quot;he,&quot; but the ruler of the country is also referred to as a king, as a male. Thus, when strongly masculine characters, like the king, suddenly become pregnant, the reader is presented with an extremely strong dichotomy that really forces the reader to think about the dual nature of the characters. If Le Guin had constantly switched between referring to characters as &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot; and frequently reminded the reader of the dual characteristics of the character, I think the characters would not have been as shocking. She decided to use the technique of establishing a singular firm image in the readers&#039; minds and then completely twisting it to get the maximum shock value. Another instance of feminine characteristics suddenly appearing to disrupt a masculine image is when Genly Ai and Estraven have a heart-to-heart conversation while traversing the ice. According to Genly Ai, &quot;â€¦I saw then again, and for good, what I had always been afraid to see, and had pretended not to see in him: that he was a woman as well as a man. Any need to explain the sources of that fear vanished with the fear; what I was left with was, at last, acceptance of him as he wasâ€¦I had not been willing to give it. I had been afraid to give it. I had not wanted to give my trust, my friendship to a man who was a woman, a woman who was a man&quot; (248). Thus, even the Genly Ai had fallen into the trap of seeing the Gethenians as simply men instead of dual beings. This passage was sort of mind bending for me because I kept wanting to think of Estraven as a man who, well, occasionally turns into a woman from time to time instead of him being both man and woman all the time. Now, since Estraven is both man and woman all the time, it puts a very different spin on his character. I could no longer peg him as a certain gender; instead, I just had to see Estraven as a living being. Ultimately, I feel that this was one of Le Guin&#039;s goals â€“ once we remove the issue of gender from people, how do we feel about them? I think the conclusion reached is that they really are still the same as us.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>To oppose is to maintain, and blue eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/143</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The issues of duality, competition, war, and progress bring to mind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.love-shy.com/Gilmartin/Chapter03/elliot.html&quot;&gt;Jane Elliott &quot;blue eyes&quot; classroom study&lt;/a&gt;. That link is knowledgeable, but not the most approachable, so let me summarize. In order to teach a lesson on discrimination to a homogenous Iowa elementary school classroom, she began an experiment where she declared children with blue eyes &#039;better&#039; than the others. After a short speech about the weaknesses of brown eyed children, she continued with the day&#039;s lesson, taking every chance to confirm the blue eyes assumed superiority and call out brown eyes&#039; negative behavior as representative of their kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are wide (and the study has its critics, of course), but I wanted to focus on the measurable changes in performance that accompanied the experiment. By the end of that first school day, measurements of math, vocabulary, and reading proficiency all showed major change from where the students were one week before: the brown eyed students&#039; scores fell drastically (e.g. regressing from a 3rd to a 1st grade reading level) and the blue eyed scores rose dramatically (e.g. improving the a 5th grade reading level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interpretation I buy into states that this only happened because our children learn at an early age that there are better and worse groups of people in our world. Classification, competition, and discrimination are functions used by our society, because they have positive effects for the &#039;better&#039; group! So how do we break out of this system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turn to what Le Guin says in The Left Hand of Darkness: &quot;To oppose something is to maintain it. [One] must offer an alternative&quot; (153). A critique of the current system is pointless without proposing other options. From the very introduction of the book she describes the importance of &quot;the imagination&quot; (i). An alternative biology, interactions with other species, the general concept of a science fiction tale about the futureâ€¦ all of these are metaphors geared toward imagining different futures in order to change the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we&#039;ve already begun a good discussion on exactly what alternative Le Guin offers. In her world, &quot;There is no division of humanity into strong and weak halves, protective/protected, dominant/submissive, owner/chattel, active/passive (94). The total breakdown of the classify/compete/discriminate system does slow the society down in some ways â€“ Genly often describes the Gethenians as slightly slower, weaker, and less advanced (50, 103) â€“ but best achieves Le Guin&#039;s ultimate value of civilization (something like &#039;the open trade of ideas, techniques, material goods/technology, and culture&#039; based on pages 34-35, 103, and 137-138). Maybe &#039;achieves&#039; is the wrong word. I think Le Guin is offering this future with hope, painting it in a good light. However, the &#039;good&#039;/&#039;bad&#039; judgment here is definitely process-oriented, not result-oriented, as based on 50, 102, and 259.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. S. Final reason I love this book? Le Guin gets special relativity right. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Left Hand of Darkness and the Masculine Ideal</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/142</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Le Guin presents to us, in The Left Hand of Darkness, with a breed of human which is truly biologically asexual, and posits that many of the traits we consider implicit to mankind are a result of the way we categorize behaviors, activities, ideologies and so forth in a male/female, dualistic manner. To strengthen the distinction between &quot;us&quot; (represented by Genly Ai) and &quot;them&quot; (the Gethenians in general and Estraven in particular), she gives us a very distinctive, stereotyped view of masculinity and femininity through Genly Ai early in the novel. Estraven is said to have &quot;...a man&#039;s power...&quot; (p. 7) as part of his character; his ability to influence and command others is, for Genly Ai, an explicitly masculine trait. Moments later, Genly expresses his distaste for what he refers to as &quot;...feminine intrigue...&quot; (p.8). The strongest moment of defining the masculine/feminine divide occurs at the palace; Genly thinks&quot;...that at table Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit.&quot; (p. 12). Le Guin&#039;s assigning of these stock roles to men and woman--power and strength versus subtlety and charm--while serving a purpose in emphasizing the duality in our culture (and the lack of one in Gethenian culture), is also misleading, and can lead to a potential misunderstanding of the novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideals of masculinity and femininity are cultural, not integral to our biology. Even in so small a difference as (in my experience) Italian versus American culture, behaviors that are considered proper form for men in one place may be seen as totally effeminate in the other. This variation ranges much more once you leave the context of Western societies, so much so that in certain areas of the world (some groups in the Caribbean, for example) aggression and physical dominance is associated with women, while subtlety and child-rearing is largely the domain of men. While that fundamental issue of duality remains, the actual traits which define masculinity and femininity are essentially irrelevant. In presenting a stereotyped Western-American cultural bias for defining the male/female divide, I feel that Le Guin runs the risk of drawing the reader too far into that mindset; although Genly perceives &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; traits in Estraven, he is simply put incorrect; Estraven&#039;s character is a unified whole, lacking binary division or masculine or feminine traits. Only once Estraven is understood as a whole person, rather than a bizarre, discomfiting amalgation of apparently opposing traits does he, and his society as a whole, make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gender Pronouns in The Left Hand of Darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/141</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout her novel, Ursula LeGuin mainly uses the masculine set of pronouns, he and him.  This seems strange for a novel set on winter, an androgyne world.  Why did LeGuin not create her own set of gender pronouns for use in the novel?  Couldn&#039;t the use of such words lessen the bias that the reader had to a specific gender?  LeGuin had many reasons for her choice of pronouns, and use of he as the main pronoun helps rather than hurts the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reason for the use of he instead of she is to counteract her natural bias.  The left hand of darkness was one of LeGuin&#039;s first books.  Her skills as a writer had not matured yet, so, writing characters as a specific gender was difficult.  Just as in science fiction written by men with women heroines, science fiction about men written by women tends to trivialize the parts, an characterize them as stereotypes rather than characters in their own right.  Worse than that, especially with characters written in first person, they may take on some of the traits of the writer.  This leads to male characters appearing female.  In the first chapter, Genly appears female, because that was how he seemed written.  The use of male pronouns however, quickly disabused me of that notion and allowed me to think him equal, and a more gender balanced character.  Estraven, written as an androgyne, appeared completely male in the first part of the book.  This was helped by the usage of the male pronouns whenever referring to him.  However, when LeGuin started writing Estraven with first person narrative, he seemed more feminine.  This was mostly because he was written by LeGuin, whose traits seeped into her writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had LeGuin felt it necessary to invent a set of gender neutral pronouns, she would have.  She invented so many terms for use in the novel hat a few more would have been completely acceptable, and maybe even useful.  For instance, she coined the terms ansible, a term still in use today, Ekumen, and the days weeks and months of her fictional cultures.  The creation of a few gender unspecific pronouns would not have been difficult.  LeGuin had created most of her invented terms in Gethenian languages.  There were gender unspecific terms in those languages, so she could easily have pulled them out and stated that they were now used in English too.  But Genly never uses that sort of pronoun.  Instead he uses he or LeGuin writing uses he.  This is to draw attention to something specific about Homo sapiens, current life on earth.  Faced with a gender that is impossible to understand normally, the human response is not to categorize it as something new, but rather to try to pigeonhole it into something old that already exists.  Throughout the first part of the novel, Genly categorizes anyone he meets into a gender.  He has a landlady, the men in the government are well, men, and so on.  He is categorizing something that really should not be categorized in that way.  LeGuin is pointing out a fallacy in the human condition when she categorizes her androgyne characters with the pronoun he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even with all her reasons, the use of he throughout LeGuin&#039;s novel can lead to complications.  The novel has not always been interpreted as a feminist novel, even though igender equality is on of its main tenets.  In her novel Winter&#039;s King, she originally used he in instance of gender pronoun.  Later, she switched it to she in every case for dome parity.  Overall though, LeGuin did a good job of using gender pronouns in her work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Being Other in the Other&#039;s eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/140</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating interplay between light and dark, and the role of shadows in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot;  Perhaps most interesting is the concept of shifgrethor, a code of honor amongst the Karhidians, which &quot;comes from an old word for shadow&quot; (247).    There is also, among the Handdarata, a focus on the &quot;un&quot;--that which seems to be the opposite of what is.  In many respects, the Karhidians seem to be defined more by what they are not, by what is unseen, and by what traditionally is thought to obscure.  It is a society that thrives through the unknown, through the unspoken (&quot;Secrecy in Karhide is to an extraordinary extent a matter of discretion, of an agreed, understood silence--an omission of questions, yet not an omission of answers&quot; (287.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is just human nature, perhaps it is a result of the weather, perhaps it is a result of a society of kemmering, not static sex assignments.  Whatever the underlying reasons are, though, this shadow life is something that the primary narrator, Genly Ai, does not understand for the bulk of the story, and which separates him from the others around him.  Likewise, this keeps others from truly understanding or questioning him.  It is not until Genly and Estraven have been a long while on the Ice that this cold wall between them begins to break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the text, the reader is presented with Genly&#039;s arguably problematic gendered perceptions of the world around him, ascribing his own frame of reference to a people that defies and in many ways destroys that frame of reference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is also something deeply unsettling about Genly for the inhabitants of Winter.  There is King Argaven&#039;s political fear and distrust of Genly&#039;s differences (34-40), and likewise his physical differences are noted by other characters over the course of his story.  It is not until Estraven and Genly have escaped to the Ice, though, and a friendship based on sheer mutual survival begins to develop, that we get any insight into how Genly is perceived, not as The Alien Envoy, but as an individual who is different.  Estraven&#039;s comments on gender at this juncture are perhaps the most interesting in the entire novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven&#039;s comments on Genly fall into two categories: the physical and the spirit, as it pertains to the body.  When Estraven himself is in kemmer, he reflects on Genly, musing &quot;A strange lowgrade sort of desire it must be, to be spread out over every day of the year, and never to know the choice of sex&quot; (232).    This sentiment seems to get to the heart of the conflict between the two depictions of sex and gender.  Estraven, when speaking of &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; means choosing male or female, not being arbitrarily assigned to one for all of life.  This flux between physical states of being seems to hearken back to the predominance of shadows in the Karhidian culture.  The flux between being sexed and androgynous also bears with it a very strong cycle of emotion, with the intensity of sexuality while in kemmer, and the utter lack of a sex drive when not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet reading the phrase &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; as one Genly&#039;s breed of humanity, I first read it as &quot;the choice to have sex, or not have sex.&quot;  Were the phrase uttered by Genly instead of Estraven, this would be a valid interpretation, as the Gethenians are as captive to their expression of sexuality by time as we are by sex assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven also ties Genly&#039;s sex to his physical and spiritual (not religious, but of the spirit) abilities.  He says &quot;There is a frailty about him.  He is all unprotected, exposed, vulnerable, even to his sexual organ which he must carry always outside himself; but he is strong, unbelievably strong.  I am not sure he can keep hauling any longer than I, but he can haul harder and faster than Iâ€¦To match his frailty and strength, he has a spirit easy to despair and quick to defiance; a fierce impatient courage&quot; (227-8).  Given Genly Ai&#039;s fairly constant comment on the slowness of life, evolution, and time on Winter, Estraven&#039;s understanding of Genly is particularly profound.  He has seen in an example of one what that one could not understand in an entire world.  Yet even this understanding of Genly&#039;s spirit is seen through the filter of the Gethenians.  Where Estraven sees frailty and physical vulnerability, our society has placed virility and strength.  Even when there is a deep personal connection between individuals, they are both still coming to one another from such different perspectives as to never be able to truly understand one another.  Though Genly spends much of the end of the book speaking of the universal human spirit, of &quot;serving Mankind&quot; (293), not just one nation or race, there are still deep differences between the races.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most telling indicator of the split between the Gethenians and Genly is that Estraven, in his times of deep emotion, of mind-connection, and in death, returns Genly&#039;s love for him by displacing his brother, Arek, onto Genry Ai, particularly in the mind-connection, where it is impossible to tell lies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might paint an initially bleak picture of the hope for understanding between Peoples at first glance, in between the arguments, running as a thread throughout, is the desire and hope for understanding.  Though this understanding might be doomed to be imperfect, on both sides, there is the effort, and the emotions created are very real.  We may never be able to walk in the Other&#039;s shoes, but there is the hope of walking along side him, and recognizing that he too must wear shoes, different though they may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The feminism of Genly Ai</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/139</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While my experience with this may not be universal, I found myself somewhat alienated by Genly Ai&#039;s perspective on the events he related.  I was much more drawn in to the narrative on those occasions when it was related by Estraven.  The factor that drew me out of Genly Ai&#039;s perspective was consistently his insistence on applying his particular conceptions of gender to the Gethenians he encountered.  Estraven, unfettered by the need to place his world into inapplicable terms, is better able to focus in on the more flowing parts of hte story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem, for me, of his mental gendering (beyond the much discussed pronoun) was the rather disturbing set of qualities he seemed to apply to the female gender.  It wasn&#039;t that his notion of masculinity wasn&#039;t disturbing, however, most of the time, when he attempted to explain or describe characteristics, it was in terms of his image of the feminine, which of course makes sense, as what he needs to relate and explain is the unfamiliar.  The easiest example is that he &quot;â€¦thought of him as [his] landlady, for he had fat buttocks that wagged as he walked, and a soft fat face, and a prying, spying, ignoble, kindly nature.&quot; (48)  He also conflates femininity with a flabby sort of softness in his descriptions of the Orgota.  Aside from that commonality, what he tends to interpret as feminine varies drastically, except that it always seems to pertain to relatively negative characteristics.  The &quot;landlady&#039;s&quot; geniality is cancelled out by his volubility, and his tendency to show of Mr. Ai&#039;s room to tourists.  He states (235) that women aren&#039;t mentally subnormal, but without conviction, as though he can&#039;t quite find another way to explain his society. It seems that the Envoy, and by extension, the Ekumen which he represents, isn&#039;t so advanced as one might expect of this egalitarian, Federation-like entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, is the purpose of this alienation?  Certainly, there&#039;s value in the alien narrator, as he takes us along in his explorations without the vehicle world-exploration appearing forced.  More importantly, however, he makes our judgments for us.  Genly Ai is a human like us, and while it&#039;s comforting to think that we would be better able to take the people of an unfamiliar society (different sexually, racially, culturally as well) on their own, appropriate terms, most people probably couldn&#039;t.  Thus, the perspective we find ourselves critiquing and drawing away from is a representation of our own.  While our critiques on the application of gender-roles to un-gendered individuals seems unconnected to our world, LeGuin is showing us a situation in which the human need to group doesn&#039;t just fail to be useful, but interferes with the ability of the thinker to do his job.  In saddling us into the head of another human, LeGuin asks us to take the message back a step further, to examine how our applications of gender roles and ideas may be hindering us now, in ways that an alien would immediately see.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much to think about when ur stuck in the ice...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/138</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still interested in what happens in this novel in terms of race, and the representation of racial issues in the future.  We might of tried to touch on it in class, but the overwhelming struggle over the meaning and the philosophy of gender in society was definitely something that took over.  It clearly has for almost all readers of the novel, down to the feminist writers who proclaimed that Le Guin&#039;s use of the male pronoun was the number one most anti-feminist act of all time.  I&#039;m not sure how many people shared my first impression, that race is something of a stagnant, bypassed, non-issue; but as we&#039;ve seen from Starship Troopers, race can be expected to take on a number of different appearances and undergo a number of different transformations in its manifestation in any brave new sci-fi world.  So I was/am suspicious that more is going on here in terms of racial politics than meets the eye.  I&#039;m of the opinion that talking about gender separately from race is inherently problematic, since all aspects of identity (but I would say these two in particular) are inextricable from one another.  They all intersect.&lt;br /&gt;
	Since one of the things that third-wave feminist literature (of member of which group this novel is ostensibly a part, according to its retrospective classification by people other than Le Guin) is reacting to is the failing of second-wave feminist literature to extend a critique of gender to other social structures, I tend to presume a consciousness in the work of the ways in which gender cannot stand alone from an issue like race.  But where do we see this in the work?&lt;br /&gt;
	On the one hand we certainly have some of the Star Trek &quot;federation&quot; model of race-overcome in Le Guin&#039;s universe, at least in the abstract and far-off body of the Ekumen.  Genly&#039;s elegant turn of phrase is not unfamiliar: &quot;we come all colors&quot; (39).  Genly himself is (to me) a typical Le Guin protagonist in that he is revealed to be dark-skinned, presumably of African descent, several pages into the novel.  Surprise, he&#039;s not Caucasian!  I think one of the passing comments in class was very accurate: Le Guin does do a certain recognizable amount of messing with what she knows are going to be the reader&#039;s assumptions, and revealing them to the reader in such a way as to make us unable to deny the systems that inform our reading of any text.  It&#039;s interesting to me here that Genly&#039;s race is one of the &quot;unsettling revelations&quot; she chooses to make, in a style similar to that in which it was casually dropped in that &quot;...even in a *bisexual society* the politician is very often something less than an integral man...&quot; (20).&lt;br /&gt;
	On the other hand, we still have what seem to be remnants of bizarre racial stereotyping worked into the novel, though in some cases I think I&#039;m willing to put it down to less-than-conscious decisions by the author.  I&#039;m not the only person to notice the Gethenian specific inability to differentiate between the &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds, or the Chinese-imperialist-style royal city-within-a-city (as evidenced in various places on the blog so far).  Bizarre referencing of &quot;oriental&quot; stereotypes, it feels like.  These are only a few instances of several when I felt a correlation between a familiar stereotype and Le Guin&#039;s fleshing out of the people of Winter in detail.  There&#039;s also the King&#039;s fascination with not only Genly&#039;s &quot;sexual perversion&quot; but his skin color, which is a troubling icon of difference to the King, alongside Genly&#039;s maleness.&lt;br /&gt;
	It&#039;s also important, I think, to keep in mind the *literal* presence and intersection of race and gender here.  To Genly Ai and the world he represents, the people of Winter are literally a different *race* of human.  The manifested differences in gender and sex, as well as various other less-novel physical traits of the Gethenians are in this way categorized as *race* differences. It&#039;s just an interesting thing to try and pick apart, since the Ekumen feels in many ways like a believable future for humanity.  Race isn&#039;t actually easy to define now, and I could easily see it undergoing a transformation of meaning and definition faced with a new and changing universe.&lt;br /&gt;
	On a slightly different note, I enjoyed the book immensely, especially since its purpose seemed to be to disrupt the reader.  I think I love this book simply as an exercise in breaking down societal givens, rather than a treatise on the inherent nature of man (human) or an attempt to solidify any one problem with modern society by reflecting it in dystopia or utopia.  It&#039;s open-ended, and though we see through Genly Ai&#039;s eyes, it is much easier to experience the world with a sense of wonder and perhaps discomfort that feel much easier to separate from the protagonist&#039;s own rationalization of the world than say, The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, in which we cannot seem to escape Offred&#039;s head and social isolation.  Interesting, since both main characters narrate their own stories precisely as stories, and both tales are conceived of as direct reports which stand as evidence for a past, unreachable experience.  I can&#039;t seem to grasp at why that is, except perhaps that the literal unseating of a gender (or sex?) dichotomy is the more novel to us, the more confrontational and the newest frontier to the reader themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Weather Versus Ambisexuality in The Left Hand of Darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/137</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ursula Le Guin, though she makes a big fuss out of the &quot;thought-experimental&quot; nature of her novel, and explicitly says that she&#039;s not trying to make a political statement such as &quot;we damned well ought to be androgynous&quot; - but even so, she seems to intentionally pad levels of ambiguity â€“ maybe even excuses, plausible deniability â€“ into any possible &quot;message&quot; of her novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest features of Gethenian society that seems to contain a hidden moral supposition is this: &quot;they [do] not go to war&quot; (48). The clarification: &quot;they behaved like animals, in that respect, or like women&quot; (48) â€“ the mention of women especially hints that Gethenians are incapable of going to war because they are too feminine, and women don&#039;t go to war. (Personally, I don&#039;t take that for granted, but for the sake of argument, I&#039;ll let it go.) The problem is that their peculiar androgyny is not the only defining feature of Gethenian culture â€“ they also live in probably the coldest environment among the novel&#039;s known inhabited planets. It is a well-supported theory in life outside this novel that geography and environment are determining features of culture (see: &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;); and that makes it believable that the Gethenian inability to mobilize is the result of their weather. Consider: going to war is an enormous undertaking; oftentimes in the past, wars had to be postponed during winter months. Part of what made Hannibal an amazing general is that he managed to cross the Alps, which are snowy all year round, and even then his army suffered massive losses. The Gethenians would have to face that sort of weather everywhere, almost all the time; war would be a massively wasteful, unproductive undertaking for them, in comparison to our wars (and that&#039;s assuming that real wars are productive!). It&#039;s impossible to rule, therefore, that their androgyny is what makes Gethenians unwarlike; but it&#039;s also impossible to rule out that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within the novel, &quot;it seems likely that [the Gethenians are] an experiment&quot; (89). But what kind of experiment are they? If they were meant to be set up in opposition to other humans, then the experiment is critically flawed, because there is no strict control â€“ there are two variables, ambisexuality and extremely cold weather. For a realistic scientific experiment, the constraints are too loose, for the reasons I&#039;ve already spelled out. However, the idea that Gethenians exist on account of &quot;human genetic manipulation&quot; (89) is a convenient one for avoiding difficult issues such as proposing that such an evolution from humans is possible, likely, or natural. Otherwise, one might suppose that Ursula Le Guin was suggesting that humans would eventually become this way; or that humans could just have easily turned out this way. But instead, she sets down the opposite notion: that this sort of thing is nigh-impossible, and exists by mere contrivance. She calls attention to the falseness of the situation in such a way that it seems to discredit value judgments of any kind. The Gethenians are not explicitly better or worse, by any standards, than normal humans; they are just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this sort of thing is all over the novel. It&#039;s almost as if Le Guin knows she&#039;s treading on sensitive ground here, and so she restrains herself from making any claims that could be construed as outrageous. Whether in doing so, she undermines the meaningfulness of her novel or allows it to be all the more insidiously thought-provoking is anyone&#039;s guess.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>though it has probably been noted...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/136</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided that I needed to take one of my freebies for the Handmaid&#039;s Tale response. That book just made me angry because of its terrible ending, and potentially frightened, because Gilead resembles what a freakish fundamentalist-Christian America would be at its most extreme. For that reason alone, I actually think that more people should have to read it, and maybe have second thoughts about pushing their morals/beliefs on others. That being said, I also already have midterms beginning. My first exam is tomorrow. Gah....: /&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>buddhism in le guin&#039;s &quot;left hand of darkness&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/135</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the religion that I most closely identify with is Buddhism, I was pleasantly surprised to see some Buddha-flavored (for lack of a better description) ideas emerging as the overarching themes or conflicts of the novel. Though little actually happens plot-wise, Le Guin has a very distinctive, almost sarcastic &quot;writer&#039;s voice&quot; that gets the reader caught up in this meandering philosophical journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; is a classic example of how third-wave feminism looked at (and continues to look at) the cultural problems of themodern world. The way that Genly Ai, a Terran, approaches human and societal differences is indicative of the struggles that people here on Earth have with the ideas of race, gender, class and so on. On one side of the conflict we have Terran duality; on the other, Gethenian oneness and fluidity. We, too, have this driving need to classify people and phenomena into categories, defining them by a single label; day and night, male and female, black and white, rich and poor. Though we acknowledge that there are gray areas to a certain extent, we are never completely comfortable with allowing someone or something to be neither, or to be both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gethenians, on the other hand, have a difficult time separating things into dualities; everything exists in a singular, cohesive state. The planet, true to its name of &quot;Winter&quot; experiences nothing but unchanging snowy weather. Gender is completely fluid, and Genly struggles to properly express someone&#039;s gender due to the constraint of his (and by extension, our) language. For example, Genly describes one Gethenian he encounters as &quot;{his} landlady, a voluble man&quot; (pg.47), which is seemingly a paradox and an expression of total androgyny. Perhaps it is safer to say that Gethenians are touched by duality to a lesser extent; they are closer to being an enlightened society, if you will. Maybe Le Guin is trying to present them as an example of what we could attain.&lt;br /&gt;
The only instances in which duality appears within Gethenian society are: 1) when male and female become distinct during the period of &quot;kemmer&quot;.  Genly Ai sticks to a singular pronoun here: &quot;I saw a girl, a filthy, pretty, stupid, weary girl looking up into my face as she talked, smiling timidly, looking for solace. The young Orgota was in kemmer&quot; (pg. 171). The other is 2) within the governmental structure. Gethenians do understand the idea of separate &quot;Domains&quot; and nations, as a sort of replacement for the duality of different races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What frustrates me the most about Left Hand of Darkness is that it does a wonderful job of presenting and describing the problems created by our dualistic worldview, but it fails to suggest a method for solving these problems. When read in the most simplistic way, perhaps the solution is &quot;move towards androgyny! forcibly train yourselves to forget gender!&quot; in which case, I simply disagree. It can be impossible to make people forget ideas that were imposed on them from birth. I wanted to know what the answer was to the duality question.&lt;br /&gt;
The book does offer readers a passage that resonates somewhat with the Buddhist idea of the &quot;middle path&quot; as the most direct route to enlightenment. Genly Ai&#039;s task as an Envoy is to move towards &quot;increase of knowledge. The augmentation of the complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent life. The enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God&quot; (pg. 34). In a similarly Buddhist way, perhaps Le Guin is purposefully leaving the question open encourage us to observe how we divide things into dualities, and take the first step on the path: self-inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ekumen and Religion?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/134</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Warning: I am feverish and have induced a headache from a superfluous amount of coughing, so I apologize if this entry is kind of wonky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first was reading The Left Hand of Darkness, I didn&#039;t really give the word/concept of &quot;Ekumen&quot; much thought.  A little bit later in the book, however, a derivation of the word was given as &quot;Ekumenical.&quot;  This jumped out at me and reminded me of the word, &quot;ecumenical,&quot; for which I (courtsey of OED) will provide a definition: belonging to or representing the whole (Christian) world; general; universal, Catholic; belonging to the whole world; universal, general, world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Ursula Le Guin is an atheist, I believe that the portrayal and role of the Ekumen as the Catholic Church is one that is subject to criticism or satire.  The narrow-mindedness of Catholicism is represented through the narrow-mindedness of the Ekumen&#039;s envoy, Genly Ai, who cannot quite grasp the lack of opposites on Winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ekumen, according to Genly, seeks &quot;the enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God&quot; (34).  I thought it really sounded like the Catholic Church when, on 136, he explains that the Ekumen is not a government, though it may share some similarities to one: &quot;It is an attempt to reunify the mystical with the political, and as such is of course mostly a failure; but its failure has done more good for humanity so far...It is a society and it has, at least potentially, a culture.  It is a form of education...it&#039;s a sort of a very large school...in another aspect it&#039;s a league or union...possessing some degree of centralized conventional organization.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the impression that the Ekumen is preoccupied with progress.  It is very much concerned with economical profits and gains, and only invites worlds to join if they are sufficiently enlightened or open to enlightenment (both religion-wise and technologically).  While some aspects of the Gethenien world are antiquated (Karhide is described as being  in a &quot;dark age&quot; [115]), others are not.  Orgoreyn is more industrialized, with standardized clothing.  Genly observes that &quot;This, now, looked like a country ready to enter Ekumenical age&quot; (115).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s interesting that in Christianity, it is God who created binaries.  He first made Adam, then Eve, a female counterpart.  Everything comes in opposites and in pairs.  The ambisexual/ambigender? inhabitants of Winter are supposedly the result of some experiment conducted by previous colonists.  This dualism and subsequent lack of binaries, though created by humans, seems to be better (in some respects) than the world created by God (no rape, no war, everyone gets pregnancy leave from work....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the random bits of Gethenien folklore or mythology, I felt, read like stories from the Bible.  With the story about the Therems and the ending of the book, I got the impression that Estraven was kind of like the prodigal son.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thing I thought was interesting: The drink called &quot;lifewater&quot;...I don&#039;t know if LeGuin knows this, but &quot;whiskey&quot; (uisge beatha) in Scottish Gaelic translates as &quot;water of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>barbarella as feminist?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/132</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I think Barbarella rocks.  Also, I found it to be suprisingly feminist, considering - well, considering everything.  On the surface it&#039;s pretty wonderful in its unselfconscious exploitation of Fonda&#039;s sexuality, but its underlying concepts are much more subversive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.  The guy that sticks around the longest in the film, and the closest thing the film has to a male protagonist.  He&#039;s far from being the standard hero type; actually he&#039;s pretty useless.  He walks into walls and just stands around until Barbarella shouts directions at him, which he quickly obeys before lapsing back into passivity.  She thanks him for saving her life in the appropriately breathless damsel-in-distress fashion, but it&#039;s pretty clear to the audience that he was little more than an extra set of appendages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Barbarella wastes a lot of time repeatedly rescuing him.  She returns to Pygar his power of flight and tells the evil tyrant to &#039;decrucify the angel or I&#039;ll MELT YOUR FACE,&#039; among other things.  He never really redeems himself.  True, he flies Barbarella into and out of the tyrant&#039;s liar, but the way Barbarella asks, the viewer gets the impression that he&#039;s just the quickest and cheapest mode of transportation and she could find another way if she REALLY wanted.  He acts as little more than motivation for the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any strong male character there to hijack the movie from her, Barbarella is the undisputed star of the show.  Yes, she sleeps with pretty much every (post-puberty) male character she encounters, but she does it without really being sexual at all.  Men beg to sleep with her, and if it&#039;s in her best interests, she shrugs cheerily and says okay.  Sex isn&#039;t taboo, dangerous, or shameful at all for her, so she has no resigned, defeated air of a woman with no other options - no &#039;weeping vrgin&#039; stereotype.  And though she often sleeps with men as a means to an end, neither does she destroy them as do exoticised &#039;black widow&#039; character types.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the movie has distinctly pornographic overtones, it is difficult to really place Barbarella (the character, though not Jane Fonda the actress) in a traditional position of desire.  There is no thrill of excitement, danger, or taboo with her, and it&#039;s much harder to desire and lust over a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Handdara Philosophy and Atheism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/131</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To examine a part of the book I feel was ignored in discussion on Monday, I wanted to explore my interest in the Handdara and their philosophy.  The whole concept of Foretelling is fascinating, especially as it is practiced in a religious society that considers it to be a completely fruitless exercise.  There is a point early on in the book when Genly is talking with Faxe about the process of Foretelling and how useful it is, but Faxe is trying to get Genly to understand him.  Faxe says &quot;â€¦we in the Handdara don&#039;t want answers.  It&#039;s hard to avoid them, but we try to.&quot; (70)  When I first considered this statement I thought that the goal of many religions is to find answers, and in this the Handdara are set apart.  However, upon closer examination of prominent organized religions, definite answers are never the goal.  If it could be answered whether or not Jesus Christ actually lived and the stories of the New Testament were true, would any Christian honestly want to know?  The point is faith, the belief that something is so, even if proof is out of the question.  Faxe expresses some degree of exasperation with Genly&#039;s questions about Foretelling and finally asks Genly &quot;you don&#039;t see yetâ€¦why we perfected and practice Foretelling?&quot; and Faxe goes on to answer his own question, &quot;to exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the wrong question.&quot;  (70)  Taking the earlier example of the existence or non-existence in actual history of Jesus, one sees that the answer to that question is immaterial, as there are so many other questions which would be more useful if answered.  For example, would Christ&#039;s alleged teachings, if truly followed by all mankind, be the answer to world peace and global unconditional human love and kindness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Handdara respect ignorance because it is the only thing that we can count on as constant, apart from death, which few people hurry towards.  At the end of the chapter, Faxe lays the philosophy of the Handdara out in plain language for Genly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The unknownâ€¦the unforetold, the unproven, that is what life is based on.  Ignorance is the ground of thought.  Unproof is the ground of action.  If it were proven that there is no God there would be no religionâ€¦but also if it were proven that there is a God, there would be no religion.&quot; (71)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much later in the book, during one of Estraven&#039;s journal entries, he suggests &quot;to be an atheist is to maintain God.  His existence or his nonexistence, it amounts to much the same, on the plane of proof&quot; (153).  Here, Le Guin inserts her own beliefs, as she stated in the foreword that she is herself an atheist.  It seems unusual for an author to openly question, or rather examine in a virtually unbiased fashion, her own beliefs through the characters she has created.  She brings up such unusual and controversial issues, and manages to look at this society, without stable gender, through its own eyes.  Questioning the human desire to know, especially creating a religious group that gives importance and prominence to ignorance, is an incredible exercise in stepping outside one&#039;s own beliefs and taking a very critical look at society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Barbarella 2009! Yoinks.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/130</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay so, for those of you who went wild over the 1968 version (for whatever reason), take a gander at what&#039;s available on the intarwebs regarding its remake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Barbarella.htm&quot; title=&quot;http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Barbarella.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Barbarella.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally from a 1962 French comic book.  Parlez vous Francais?&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;d better adjust my tongue-box...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can they possibly do with this film that will make it a releasable venture in the movie world of 2009?  What do you think would have to go, and what might stay, to make it marketable to today&#039;s audience?  Just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De-crucify the angel, or I&#039;ll MELT your FACE.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 4</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/129</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I seem to be one of the few people who found The Left Hand of Darkness worthy of a response paper, so maybe I read (oh God, the unintentional pun) too much into this one.  However, I found Le Guin&#039;s novel extremely entertaining, and I actually thought that it raised some interesting questions not only about gender, but also about sexuality in general.  Obviously, the most blatant issues deal with gender, but I feel like there are some other things that we didn&#039;t have the chance to touch on in class.&lt;br /&gt;
	Some of the most interesting parts of the novel were those that Le Guin almost completely brushed over.  The concept of incest was especially intriguing: why did the author choose to insert this interesting bit of information into the lives of the Gethenians?  In many ways, she presents a relatively utopian society--there is no war and, sexually speaking, the roles are remarkably equalized.  However, in addition to this liberalized sexuality, she also makes them incestuous.  In the Gethenian world, incest is not only not frowned upon, but is entirely acceptable.  However, there are exceptions to this rule: &quot;Incest is permittedâ€¦between siblings, even the full siblings of a vowed-kemmering pair.  Siblings are not however allowed to vow kemmering, nor keep kemmering after the birth of a child to one of the pair&quot; (Le Guin 92).  However, I could not completely understand why this restriction is so important to Gethenian society.  If incest is entirely acceptable, why would it be bad for the parents to continue kemmering even after the birth of their first child?  Obviously, there is some degree of taboo to incest that is inescapable, even on another world.  In addition to the restriction against the continuation of kemmering after the birth of a child, there is also the ban against incest between generations.  Children seem to have a certain innocence about incest that the adults do not: they cannot witness it in their parents, and their parents cannot act out incestuous feelings with them.&lt;br /&gt;
	There is another taboo in Gethen that is hidden much better than incest: homosexuality.  Although to a naÃ¯ve Earth reader the interactions between Estraven and Genly would seem homoerotic, they would not be regarded as such on Gethen.  After all, Estraven &quot;was a woman as well as a man&quot; (Le Guin 248).  Genly is obviously a difficult case, because of his &quot;perversion,&quot; but their relationship is not overtly homosexual due to the androgyny of Estraven.  However, actual homosexuality was certainly almost a moot point in Gethenian society: &quot;If there are exceptions, resulting in kemmer-partners of the same sex, they are so rare as to be ignored&quot; (Leguin 90).  This is the only mention that readers get of homosexuality as the Gethenians would see it.  To me, this seemed very strange in such a boundary-breaking novel.  Obviously, Le Guin chose to brush over the subject of homosexuality in Gethenian culture, but she thrusts the homoerotic relationship of Genly and Estraven directly into her readers&#039; faces.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, it is important to remember that all of our descriptions of Gethenian sex acts come from outsiders&#039; perspectives.  Any commentary on taboos and customs must be filtered through a non-Gethenian mind.  Obviously, this calls into question the reliability of the information--since the speaker has not undergone kemmering, they cannot personally know all of the details. Assuming the reliability of the information, Le Guin seems to imply that there are limits to taboo-breaking.  She can make a society that accepts incest, but it will not infiltrate into the minds of its children. She can present a pseudo-homoerotic love scene, but it is not REALLY homosexuality because one of the characters is simply androgynous.  The Left Hand of Darkness breaks down some interesting walls, but it also suggests the presence of other, more inflexible ones.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Left Hand of Darkness Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/128</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that was touched on in class recently was the way in which Genly Ai often characterized the ways the Gethenieas acted around him. Particularly interesting to me were the ways that appeared derogatory towards woman, and what this conveys about him and the &#039;Ekumenical&#039; society he comes from.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first that caught my attention appeared on page 48-9, when Genly is describing the Karhiders&#039; absence of war.  He says that, &quot;They lackedâ€¦the capacity to mobilize.  They behaved like animals in that respect; or like woman.  They do not behave like men, or ants.&quot;  In this comparison, he act in a similar manner to Starship Trooper&#039;s Johnny, placing woman on a level seemingly below men when it comes to being able to fight wars.  This is on an even larger scale though; whereas Johnny discredits them as not being infantry or front-line fighters, Genly appears to not seem a woman capable of mobilizing towards war at all.  Similarly, near the end of the novel (pg 299), he describes the first person he meets in the Estre Hearth as so silent that, &quot;no girl could keep so grim a silence as he did.&quot;  This is an oddly conspicuous comment, especially with so little basis in why he would think this way. This little off-hand remark helps lets us infer much about Genlys background.  Later in the novel, Genly confesses to Estreven that he understands very little about woman at all, inferring some trouble he may have had in the past in relationships or meetings with woman in general.  He has his own perception of woman from is own experience, not some grandiose utopian notion of equality or acceptance.  Does this reflect then more on his personal experience, or on the nature of the Ekumen he comes from?&lt;br /&gt;
	In my opinion, the fact that he makes these observations makes the society from which he comes from much more believable as a human future.  At first, at least to me, the Ekumenical system he is from seems overly optimistic.  A large, constantly expanding society with sizeable gaps in technology among several different races, even those with a common genetic background, seems unlikely to be so peaceful, and this makes it unbelievable to me.  Were it not for Genlys infrequent, not-so-PC references, I would have a lot of trouble connecting to the society as a whole.  The references themselves are what make him a human, imperfect and opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>An Interesting Ending to and Interesting Novel...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/127</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Le Guin&#039;s novel seems to be an interesting, if strange, subject -- bisexual individuals -- yet it seems that a majority of the sort of &quot;oddness&quot; that appears is either random differences from humans -- for example, not being able to say the &quot;L&quot; sound (Le Guin 30) -- or in the developing relationship between Genly and Estraven in the later parts of the novel.  Other than that....most of the events and societal customs observed seem either familiar or not very outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the whole gender-neutral aspect seems to be focused on very little...with only random thoughts of Genly to remind a reader that these people are, indeed, alien.  At least how I read the novel, these individuals could easily pass as normal people, and the only defining characteristic that marks the world as alien is the endless cold and snow that permeates nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the way it is described for the beginning of the novel, Gethen is not a very interesting place compared to Earth....and could almost be the same.  As time goes by however, primarily beginning with Genry and Estraven&#039;s journey across the ice, things seem to change.  Suddenly the &quot;interesting&quot; qualities of Estraven are more apparent (what with the two of them alone out there) and for probably the first time it is easily apparent both to Genry and us as readers how alien and different such a characteristic (bisexualism) really is.  While for most of the novel the various people appear as solely male...Estraven slowly but surely shows his feminine side during the times in the tent on the Gobrin ice, especially when he comes to be in kemmer (232).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several chapters of stark contrast, the novel ends similarly to how it began....but the effect of that time the pair spent on the ice is still there, and even Genry notices how much the natives have changed him...seeing his own kind as strange (296).  As a result, even though the topic was avoided for a majority of the novel, the dual feminism and masculinity of the people of Gethen seems all the stranger...yet much more interesting for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>response to The left hand of darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/126</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a peripheral point in the novel, but wouldn&#039;t something like mindspeech completely change a society? I can&#039;t think of more than a couple of scientific advancements in human history that have been anywhere close to as important to the nature of human interaction than that would be. The telepathy itself is cool, but not all that important. The part that matters is that it is impossible to lie. Of course, people could still speak lies, but how could they ever get away with it in anything important? Why would anyone sign a contract without asking to be told in mindspeach that his/her partner intended to honor it? No innocent person would ever be put in jail (at least by accident), and detective work would become fairly easy. The legal status of mindspeech might get a little complicated (would people be required to mind-testify about crimes? Could it be monitored, physically and legally? If that turned out to be impossible, how would the questioner&#039;s honesty be verified, etc.), but that is not really the most interesting question it would raise.&lt;br /&gt;
	The social implications of mindspeach might, I think, go even deeper. I wonder if we would be able to handle a society where people could choose to prove their honesty at any point if they chose? Wouldn&#039;t we assume that anyone who did not want to mindspeak something he/she was saying was lying? If you told your girlfriend you loved her in mindspeach, and she answered in kind but in words, what would you think? There are two obvious directions such a society might go. In one, which the idealistic part of me wants to believe in, people would simply become utterly honest. There would be no true secrets, because even though not everything would be conveyed in mindspeach, there would always be the knowledge that one question could reveal anything. Because people understood that there were no secrets, maybe they would not get so offended about little things. Manners would more or less disappear over time, as honesty became a habit as well as a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;
	These ideas do not even brush the surface of how deeply society would be changed, I think. An honest society would be almost recognizable in a lot of ways. But there is also the question of whether humans are capable of creatng such a culture of honesty, even with a tool like mindspeach. What I think is probably more likely is that strong taboos would be created against asking personal or prying questions, and against using mindspeach except in specialized circumstances (the military and law enforcement might fall in this category). I really am not sure what to think about this question, but for me the most interesting part of the book was its offhanded way of addressing this incredibly revolutionary technology. As I have argued, it seems like it would change human life in very fundamental ways. I would love to hear what other people think about this. Also, in deference to the subjects out class is supposed to be about, has anyone noticed that the narrator is very sexist?&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The clash of duality and singularity is the overarching theme and conflict in Ursula LeGuin&#039;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot;  Many things on Gethen seem to exist in a state of oneness rather than parity, and while the contrasting of Genly Ai&#039;s dualistic worldview against this new &quot;norm&quot; is how this idea is predominantly played out, many fail to notice that there do exist examples of pairing within the Gethenian society and planet, and I feel there to be yet another overarching theme that can be derived out of this clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genly comes from Terra, if I&#039;m not mistaken also known as our own planet Earth, and brings with him a mind preconditioned to seeing things in opposition.  For example, he tells his companion Therem Harth rem ir Estraven, a native Gethenian of the Yin and Yang symbol, telling Estraven that &quot;Light is the left hand of darknessâ€¦ how did it go?  Light, dark.  Fear, courage.  Cold, warmth.  Female, male,&quot; (267).  This very clearly demonstrates how Genly tries to view things, in pairs.  Similarly, Genly often tries to classify the Gethenians into the paired sexual confines he is used to, male and female, when describing them in his self-proclaimed story-report, telling of &quot;[His] landlady, a voluble man,&quot; and of another, &quot;wiping the sweat from his dark forehead the man â€“ man I must say, having said he and his,&quot; (47, 5).  To us the first description seems a strange contradiction, and the second an unnecessary attempt at explaining pronoun selection, yet his struggle is not without merit.  He finds it very difficult on Gethen to split people, places, and other thing into their Terran dualalities, and finds that the Gethenians themselves see things in quite a contrasting manner due to the strangeness of their planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the greatest reason that Gethen and its inhabitants defy division into pairs stems from the physiological design of the Gethenian people.  They are for the greater part of their lives, androgynous beings incapable of separation into male or female, and often exhibiting characteristics typical of both, evidenced by the voluble male landlady.  Also, the planet is in an almost perpetual state of winter without really any other strong seasons, meaning the weather almost everyday is &quot;snowy&quot;, and the inhabitants are comprised of the same race rather than the many different peoples of Earth and other planets within LeGuin&#039;s universe.  Notice, though, that all examples but my final are conditional, revealing that pairings do in fact exist on this world of singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gethenians do split into male and female beings during their period of kemmer, much like a menstrual cycle.  Genly describes how &quot;I saw a girl, a filthy, pretty, stupid, weary girl looking up into my face as she talked, smiling timidly, looking for solace.  The young Orgota was in kemmer, and had been drawn to me,&quot; (171).  During this stage, they react to their kemmer partner and their anatomy transforms to fill the roles of male and female, giving us the customary parity.  Even in the absence of racial divisions one can find a substitute in governmental designations between the two Gethenian nations of Karhide and Orgoreyn.  Karhide on the one hand is a monarchy, ruled by King Argaven in form very similar to a European monarchy, while Orgoreyn is almost blatantly structured as a socialist state where everyone is given a job by the government, things are shared, and dissidents and criminals are sent to &quot;farms&quot; as punishment, a contrast much like that between the governments of Western Europe and the Soviet Union.  So, as one may note, dualism is not absent on Gethen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this talk of pairing and oneness I feel to be aside from the true message of the novel.  If one examines a bit further, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; can be seen rather as a religious or spiritual text.  Both the Gethenians and the Ekumen of Known Worlds, the interplanetary league Genly works for as an Envoy, are in the end on a quest towards the same goal: Enlightenment.  Now, they aren&#039;t working towards strictly the same type of enlightenment, but ideas and principles are much the same.  The Ekumen searches for Enlightenment by means of connecting all mankind to create greater and more knowledgeable beings.  As Genly explains it, the Ekumen searches for &quot;material profit.  Increase of knowledge.  The augmentation of the complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent life.  The enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God,&quot; (34).  This sounds very much like a spiritual journey, except instead of it being an individual&#039;s quest, it is undertaken by all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gethenians also have their goal of Enlightenment, set before them by a very Buddha-esque figure, Meshe.  Followers of the Yomesh cult are &quot;obedient to their rule of inactivity or non-interference.  That rule (expressed in the word nusuth, which I have to translate as &#039;no matter&#039;) is the heart of the cult,&quot; (60).  Additionally, according to legend, &quot;Meshe is the Center of Timeâ€¦ The life of every man is in the Center of Time, for all were seen in the Seeing of Meshe, and are in his Eye.  We are the pupils of his Eye.  Our doing is his Seeing: our being his Knowing,&quot; (162-3).  Meshe is the quintessential &quot;enlightened being,&quot; knowing and seeing all at once, and a similar state is sought by many of the Gethenians.  So in fact, this is a book about the Duality of Gethen and the Ekumen both seeking out the goal of Oneness within the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Primacy of Representation?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/121</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To follow up on our &quot;uncontroversial&quot; class discussion yesterday, I wanted to offer some thoughts that will hopefully lead to greater analytical synergy between the two majoritary viewpoints being expressed, namely, a) dominant systems of representation (of which language is one example) are exclusionary insofar as they prohibit the expression of positions (identitarian, political, etc.) that diverge from normative standards, versus b) systems of representations always reflects the proclivities of their agents (e.g., humans who use language) and therefore present deficiencies will necessarily work themselves out--or in its inverse formulation, if present deficiencies don&#039;t work themselves out, then they weren&#039;t even deficiencies in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously these positions don&#039;t seem formally incompatible, which begs the question: What was at stake in the in-class debate? On the whole, the dividing wedge came down to discrepancies apropos of the question of agency--how much control does the individual have over the systems of representations that she uses to express her positionality in the world? How much does the onus to change systems of representation reside with the individuals impacted by their putatively &quot;adverse&quot; effects? The pure libertarian response would be &quot;completely,&quot; whereas the pure social constructivist response would be &quot;not at all.&quot; The polemical stand-off between these two positions can, of course, proceed ad infinitum (indeed, without much to show for it), but I think it&#039;s worthwhile to consider qualitative differences between the distinct modes by which discourses, institutions, and social practices produce our self-reflexive individuality. There is an important difference between 1) social construction that stops individuals from expressing themselves, and 2) social construction that depicts an &quot;illusory&quot; field of social relations in such way as to obscure concrete antagonisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is basically what&#039;s up for grabs in the agency v. social determinism debate, to which, again, it&#039;s hard not to respond with copious yawning. The latter, however, is indispensable for making sense of what it means to excercise one&#039;s agency in the world. One discursive thread from the libertarian side in class yesterday was that culture and sociality define our systems of representations and not vice versa. However, considering that systems of representation inevitably delimit the ways that we conceptualize precisely what constitute &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;sociality,&quot; our ability to discern and grapple critically with concrete antagonisms will be limited at best. How can we claim, for instance, that gender neutral pronouns will &quot;emerge&quot; (by some magically transmutive process, it seems) exactly when gender confusion becomes a socio-cultural issue if no systems of representations are in place to alert people who remain unaffected by gender confusion of its problematic status? In other words, there might be problems, at one level, for gender-queer individuals who want to express their position but can&#039;t find the semiotic tools to do so. Much more acute, however, is the meta-level problem: that without active changes in the language, no semiotic channels exist to facilitate other people&#039;s awareness about the social antagonisms borne out of gender confusion. How can we possibly expect, e.g., English speakers to transform their language in order to reflect concrete antagonisms if the language itself is constantly working to systematically obscure such antagonisms? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final thought: It misses the point of social constructivist criticism to fall back on the &quot;we can never account for all minority positions [so therefore we shouldn&#039;t even try]!&quot; narrative that has become nauseatingly commonplace in discursive backlash against so-called &quot;identity politics&quot; (it&#039;s more than slightly ironic that purveyors of such backlash tend to employ the same &quot;victimizing&quot; language that the purport to despise [e.g., it shouldn&#039;t be the labor of white people to account for EVERY SINGLE minority status imagineable --&amp;gt; white people have become the victims [!]). Destabilized libidinal matrices notwithstanding, I&#039;m sincerely unsure what &quot;threat&quot; this narrative is responding to, since no one&#039;s demanding that EVERY SINGLE minority status become the object of collective sympathy, some brand of social reparations, etc. If normativity and marginality are bound in an inextricable dialectic to one another, then certain positions will always be majoritary and others minoritary. The important point of social constructivist theory is to underscore the ideological arbitrarity of what has come to occupy the center and margin respectively--and in terms of social practice, to continually explore how seemingly &quot;natural&quot; hierarchies are, in fact, arbitrary, and furthermore, how they reinforce socio-historically specific power arrangements. Surely we can keep such a space of interrogation open without it amounting to an insurmountable burden for majoritary subjects. Indeed, it is difficult to see anything beyond the crude and puerile re-inscription of traditional White-hetero-normative domination in chest-pounding arguments to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>duality and war</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/119</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though we discussed all the issues involved in the duality inherent in our culture and language, I don&#039;t think we really discussed the issue of duality itself as Ursula Le Guin portrays it in The Left Hand of Darkness. It is true that our fixation with the opposites of male and female make interpreting the world of Gethen difficult; we can&#039;t quite comprehend the idea of androgynous humans. But this doesn&#039;t mean our refusal to let go of this way of thinking is necessarily bad. We think of many important ideas in this way, not just gender--light/dark, good/evil, black/white, right/wrong, nature/civilization. The point is, however, that in any duality, neither half is better or more important than the other. As Estraven says, &quot; &#039;It&#039;s queer that daylight&#039;s not enough. We need the shadows, in order to walk.&#039; &quot; (267) Genly Ai of course points out the yin yang symbol to Estraven, something we as a society often reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider this further, however, there is another reason thinking in dualities is not inherently a bad thing. Though we specifically name the two ends of the spectrum, we also recognize the area between as having possibility--the &quot;gray&quot; area, both a combination of black and white and between them. Obviously, we have the middle word for the black/white duality, but what&#039;s the middle word for the right/wrong or good/evil duality? We don&#039;t have one (that I know of--feel free to correct me). We do understand the concept this middle word would describe, however, because there are so many instances in life that cannot be placed at either end of the spectrum. I think Le Guin is in part identifying one middle concept that we haven&#039;t really considered, which is why it is so difficult for us to comprehend. Maybe over time there will be a need for a pronoun to describe an &quot;it&quot; in a non-degrading way, but in the novel androgyny is used at least partially to show how our idealistic dual way of thinking applies to the real world. As she says in the introduction, Le Guin is &quot;merely observing&quot; and &quot;describing&quot; (5th pg of intro) the world as it currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different train of thought, Le Guin also interestingly critiques nationalism, patriotism, and war. The Gethenians have no word for war, probably a result from rather than a cause behind the fact they have never had a war--just small competitions, though sometimes equally fatal. On the subject of patriotism, Estraven asks, &quot;[W]hat is the sense of giving a boundary to all that, of giving it a name and ceasing to love where the name ceases to apply? What is love of one&#039;s country; is it hate of one&#039;s uncountry?&quot; (211) Of course, it is in order to change this view, in order to bring the nation of Karhide together that Tibe wants to create war with Orgoreyn, though this is difficult without an actual word to describe his intent. &quot;He was after something surer, the sure, quick, and lasting way to make people into a nation: war. . . . The only other means of mobilizing people rapidly and entirely is with a new religion; none was handy; he would make do with war.&quot; (103) (Is this also a critique of religion--or at least new religion, which is simply a cult? Must ponder later.) War obviously does create nationalism--Americans never feel more American than when they are banded together against some foreign enemy. I&#039;m not sure, however, why war and religion are the only two options for Tibe. Why he wants war is only more unclear with the interesting observation, &quot;If civilization has an opposite, it is war. Of those two things, you have either one, or the other. Not both.&quot; (102) It would follow, then, that if the country waged war, it would be nationalistic but no longer actually a country, just a fighting body. Perhaps it is through the idea that in war we regress to more animalistic, aggressive ways of viewing our enemy. Even more interesting is that Le Guin has provided us with another duality to consider: war and civilization. In this case, is there still a middle ground, as in the other dualities? Once again, interestingly, it seems the Gethenians have the answer: they have both civilization and conflict, but their conflicts are limited to small numbers of people, and most often people within a country, not between countries.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Why Women Aren&#039;t Funny.</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Linked through the Slog, I found this. I went in expecting to be quite offended, and was surprised by the wit with which Mr. Hitchens went through his argument. Does it being funny make it any less offensive? Does he have a point? Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gethenians and Bugs</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I had been pondering in class, but didn&#039;t really get around to talking about was a comparison between the Bugs of Starship Troopers and the Gethenians.  I was considering how we responded very differently, as did the protagonists, to the bugs and the Gethenians and what some of the factors are that go into that.  In class we were describing the Gethenians as so very different from us, but at the same time, according to Le Guin&#039;s constructed biological family tree both the people of Terran and the people of Gethen were descended from the same people of Hain, and Genly can &quot;pass&quot; as being a native of the planet, if a slightly strange one.  (That also brings up the idea of &quot;passing,&quot; which is an incredibly loaded discussion both in considering race and gender/sexuality, but I don&#039;t have the stamina or inclination to go there right now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bugs had a similarly binary sexuality, even though separated by caste, so there were the drones and warriors - who we assume are male - and then the queen, obviously female.  Perhaps it is that the Bugs were so much like insects that we barely compared them to ourselves, but it struck me as strange that we mentioned how different the Gethenians were when Estraven states that from a visible standpoint, and even in some cultural aspects, they&#039;re extremely similar, it&#039;s the inner biology that so very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if this makes sense to anyone else, but it stuck out as a thought during discussion today that we seemed more comfortable with the idea of an insect race of aliens with identifiable and stable genders that we can clearly categorize and compare to something familiar.  And we seemed highly uncomfortable with the idea of this fluctuating gender and the accompanying foreign changes that result from it in society, even though solely by physical appearance the Gethenians should have been so much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d be happy to hear any thoughts, as mine aren&#039;t really formed into a single cohesive argument at all.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;[edit: Never mind. I ran into someone who caught me up. I&#039;m keeping the post up here for the Le Guin link below]&lt;br /&gt;
I was down in San Diego during class today. Could someone give me a super-brief run-down of what we talked about? (e.g. The impact of Black=normal on racial/political relations in Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin&#039;s treatment of gender as ____, Soviet Union/USA metaphors, or whatever we ended up discussing). Thanks much!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Soviets in Orgoreyn</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/114</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is kind of in addition to my earlier post, but I was just wondering if anyone had drawn the connections between Orgoreyn and Soviet Russia.  Obviously, they&#039;re both cold. BUT, also, Orgoreyn has a secret police, and their media is controlled by the censorship of the mysterious Sarf.  In addition to these similarities, Orgoreyn is also  &quot;a genuine fullblown bureaucracy&quot; (Le Guin 144).  The descriptions of the work camp also sound disturbingly similar to those of the gulag: &quot;At Pulefen Farm we were...underfed for the work we did, and our clothing, particularly our footwear, was completely inadequate for that winter climate.  The guards, most of them probationary prisoners, were not much better off&quot; (Le Guin 178).  There are other similarities, but I thought that these were the most interesting.  Anyone else notice this? (or it might just be disturbingly obvious, and we&#039;ll probably talk about it in class :))&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Insanity in Karhide</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/113</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Slightly departing from the central themes of the course, I was very interested in the concept of mental illness on Gethen.  Obviously, insanity acts as a catalyst in the novel, simply by leading the king to order Estraven&#039;s exile.  However, madness is less abhorred than respected in this culture, something that the narrator seems to find distasteful: he asks, confused &quot;if these two psychopaths could not be cured&quot; (Le Guin 63).  There is a definite admiration found in the Karhider&#039;s voice when he responds, &quot;Would you cure a singer of his voice?&quot; (Le Guin 63).  Although the Foretellers might perhaps be outliers (Oracles at Delphi, if you will), the king&#039;s madness leads me to think that insanity is a quality respected in Gethen.  Everyone seems to understand that the king is absolutely insane.  The narrator confesses it openly, tossing it in almost as a joke: &quot;If this is the Royal Music, no wonder the kings of Karhide are all mad&quot; (Le Guin 3).&lt;br /&gt;
However, the insane king does not prove to be the most malicious one.  The sheer stability and cautiousness of the other government&#039;s bureaucracy is much more dangerous than Argaven&#039;s pure madness: &quot;It was odd that in the less primitive society, the more sinister note was struck&quot; (Le Guin 144).  Le Guin obviously chose to make Argaven insane for a reason; through this madness, she avoided portraying him as a completely idealized monarch.  However, it also serves to make the Karhide society less intimidating and sinister and more oddly comical, a nation with a fool for a king.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Plausibility of Gilead</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/112</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret Atwood describes a world in Handmaid&#039;s Tale that seems to be exaggerated to make a point, and not a realistic possibility.  However, a closer look at the psychology behind such cultures reveals it is not as out of the question as we may presume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misconception by people is their self-perceived immunity to manipulation.  In 1961 Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram performed one of the most controversial, and interesting, experiments of the century.  His experiment was run three months after the start of a Nazi war criminal, and was designed to determine how much the Nazi&#039;s were individually responsible for the horrors that they committed during the war.  The basic set up of the experiment involved the subject being told they were studying the effects of punishment on thinking, and were told to shock another participant (really an actor), with increasingly higher voltages until a correct answer was produced.  The experiment runner, who sat near the participant and served as the authority figure, proposed the questions.  The voltage went as high as 450 volts, and long before that the actor would be yelling from the other room in pain and complaining of possible serious complications from heart problems.  When Milgram polled his colleagues before the experiment, they believed that only the vilest people would go all the way (an average of 1.2%).  The actual results were astounding, in that 65% of participants went to 450 volts, although many of them protested while they were doing so.  The reason so many commited this seemingly horrid task was the influence of the experimenter in the room, who told repeated only four lines when the participants complained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Please continue.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The experiment requires that you continue.&lt;br /&gt;
3. It is absolutely essential that you continue.&lt;br /&gt;
4. You have no other choice, you must go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experiment has been run many more times, with separate variables adjusted.  The most critical variable by far has been shown to be the perceived presence an authority held by the experimenter urging them to go on.  Although peer conformity has been shown to have a strong effect, for when it was run with a &quot;dummy&quot; teacher running the supposed same experiment next to the participant and the &quot;dummy&quot; went all the way with the experiment, only 3 of 40 subjects stopped before the end, meaning it is incredibly hard to resist society like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the implications of this experiment are obviously huge, and go a long way in explaining how an entire country could go on a genocide campaign.  It also explains how a world such as Gilead could stay in power, with half its people oppressed.  The &quot;authority figure&quot; in Gilead is represented by the government, which although it isn&#039;t seen outright often, as we mentioned in class this can be much more oppressing than an overt government like in the movie.  The government is perceived to have infiltrated everyday life with their &quot;eyes&quot;, and so it is difficult to even talk about resistance.  Disobedience has obvious consequences, as shown by the hangings of &quot;criminals&quot;:  &quot;They have committed atrocities and must be made into examples, for the rest.  Though this is hardly needed.  No woman in her right mind, these days, would seek to prevent a birth, should she be so lucky as to conceive&quot;(33).  The level of authority held by the government rivals that of Nazi Germany, and so I would argue that the men in the book are no less responsible for the catastrophe than the women, and that a lack of action by any one of them does not necessarily constitute a weak character, but just a lack of an exceptionally strong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes for Offred too.  Her lack of resistance in the first half of the book does not in any way make her weak, and her actions in the second half, such as playing scrabble and having sex with Nick, I believe are much more indicative of a strong character than we first assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was also mentioned in class, Atwood has discussed how the roots of Gilead come from other societies that have, or currently do exist.  The situations in some middle-eastern countries have very similar parallels in their oppression of women, and show that it is not that out of the question for it to occur.  I believe distopian books are very important not just for the sake of whatever message they present, like the gender equality statements of &quot;Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot;, but so that we can be reminded of our susceptibility to authority, and avoid a distopia of our own.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Do You Think it is possible?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/111</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I read anything which portrays a world in which there has been a severe decline in standards, I think to myself, &quot;is this possible.&quot;  Atwood&#039;s tale is compelling and thoughtful in its own conditions, but I wonder if those conditions are reasonable.  I wonder if it is really possible to take so much away from most people, and still maintain order.  Part of gives me confidence in my future my perception that most americans espouse the notion of justice and freedom, and that any serious violation wouldn&#039;t be tolerated.  But, events since 2001 have challenged that perception.  There is clearly a much greater willingness to sacrifice these ideals when presented with a minor threat like terrorism than I thought.  This makes me wonder, what would the american people be willing to sacrifice if presented with a much realer threat?  Would they be willing to sacrifice equality?  Would they be willing to sacrifice their freedom to choose their own future?  How strong is the desire for survival?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s in a name?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/110</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The reader is introduced to THT&#039;s patronymic naming system via &quot;newness&quot; in the SF-specific, Huntingtonian sense. In the first section, we are clued in to the fact that something is awry in the book&#039;s world, naming-wise, by the sort of ominous catalogue of pedestrian Catholic school-girl-sounding names: &quot;Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June&quot; (4). (&quot;Aunt&quot; seems like a strange title, too, but there are other things to worry about for the moment.) This is then followed by the introduction of Rita the Martha.: &quot;Rita is in here, standing at the kitchen table, which has a top of chipped white enamel. She&#039;s in her usual Martha&#039;s dressâ€¦. She puts on the veil to go outside, but nobody much cares who sees the face of a Martha&quot; (9). Here, we find a recognizable use of naming paired with an unrecognizable use of naming, so that we know that certain names are used in the same way in this world as they are in our world, and certain names are used very differently. What, we wonder, is a Martha?&lt;br /&gt;
	In the same chapter, we&#039;re introduced to Serena Joy, the Commander&#039;s Wife. At this point in the novel, it seems pretty clear that the improbable name &quot;Serena Joy&quot; is a stage name from &quot;The Growing Souls Gospel Hour&quot; (16). In the rest of the novel, though, she still bears the same name, and there is never any attempt to delve into the matter further.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then, finally, amid this small amount of name-related confusion, we get introduced to the patronymic naming system: &quot;Her name is Ofglen, and that&#039;s about all I know about her&quot; (19). This is sort of a tricky way for Atwood to have gone about this business, since &quot;Ofglen&quot; is less immediately transparent than, say, &quot;Ofcharles&quot; or even &quot;Ofwayne&quot;--it is more than possible, that is, to look at the word &quot;Ofglen&quot; and see only a weird, quasi-Nordic name, without yet discerning the system and its purpose. It is also important, I think, that Ofglen&#039;s name is presented as an absolute fact--&quot;that&#039;s about all I know about her.&quot; Ultimately, it will become clear that to give &quot;Ofglen&quot; as Ofglen&#039;s name is to give a sort of misinformation. She surely does have another, real name. It&#039;s simply the case that the narrator isn&#039;t privy to this information. But--strangely, I think--she doesn&#039;t seem concerned by this.&lt;br /&gt;
The scene in the Milk and Honey store is the first time that real information about how naming is worked gets revealed to the reader. This makes a certain amount of sense, since this is also the first instance of significant social interaction. First, there&#039;s the revelation that places can&#039;t really conceivably be named in words but must instead be named with pictures--&quot;Our first stop is at a store with another wooden sign: three eggs, a bee, a cow. Milk and Honey&quot; (25). The naming of women gets revealed in a way that looks incidental--via gossip: &quot;&#039;Who is it?&#039; I hear behind me. &#039;Ofwayne. No. Ofwarren&#039;&quot; (26). It takes the juxtaposition of these two names--in conjunction with the already-given &quot;Ofglen&quot;--to solidify our understanding of what&#039;s going on as far as women&#039;s names.	This is exactly the sort of principle of &quot;newness&quot; that Huntington points out as in Neuromancer. First, the reader is introduced into a system that feels somehow foreign or different but that is not explained in detail. It works sort of like Kafka, in a way--we just have to accept the information given to us. But, unlike in Kafka, things eventually get explained, get reordered into a system that, while still unfamiliar, seems at least logical.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think what remains sort of disturbing or sinister about naming in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is that none of it is ever fully explained. The new system is never fully revealed. We never know, for instance, what Offred&#039;s &quot;real&quot; name was. (And even her patronymic seems hopelessly vague: just as &quot;Ofglen&quot; looks in a certain sense opaque to me, I can&#039;t look at &quot;Offred&quot; and not read &quot;Off-red,&quot; as in the color--the color of the handmaids&#039; dresses, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;
Even the &quot;Historical Notes&quot; section seems perplexed by the amount of information we get: &quot;She does not see fit to supply us with her original nameâ€¦. The other names in the document are equally useless for the purposes of identification and authentication. &#039;Luke&#039; and &#039;Nick&#039; drew blanks, as did &#039;Moira&#039; and &#039;Janine.&#039; There is a high probability that these were, in any case, pseudonyms&quot; (306). Far from comforting or explanatory, the historical notes further undermine whatever sense of confidence or normality we might have found in, e.g., Moira&#039;s name.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Utopia and Reasonability (Atwood response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/109</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to further explore two interrelated strands of discussion from last class: on the one hand, the consequences of Atwood&#039;s rendering her dystopia with fidelity to certain internal currents of various socio-political developments in the 1980&#039;s (e.g., Reaganism, porn-burning feminism, the &quot;breakdown&quot; of the East-West Cold War-era binary, etc.); and on the other, the political implications of distinguishing between &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;dogmatic&quot; forms of an ideological system (a distinction which was invoked at least once in an attempt to explain the basis of 1980&#039;s &quot;anti-feminist&quot; backlash [of which Atwood&#039;s text may or may not be an example]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stake in both cases is the question of what to make of the structural gap between the theoretical mandates of a given social order&#039;s foundational and the practical mandates of its &quot;actually existing&quot; manifestation. Can this gap ever be closed, which is to say, can ideology-on-paper and implementation-in-the-world ever overlap fully? Slavoj Zizek contends that it cannot, and his reasoning is as follows: because the call of ideology is never &quot;pure&quot;--its coercive, positive claims (e.g., Be a good person! Share with others!) are necessarily supplemented by its internally transgressive &quot;seedy underside,&quot; which disrupts its positive claims from within (e.g. Be a good person! Share with others! [unless you decide that transnational business is your passion, in which case, by all means follow your heart...])--the actualization of a given ideological system is predicated on the disavowal of certain internal mandates of said system. In other words, the &quot;imperfection&quot; of ideology-in-practice is already present in ideology-in-form. Zizek&#039;s account suggests that internal disavowals are not the mark of ideology&#039;s mis-actualization (as though the &quot;real thing&quot; is lurking there somewhere behind its butchered form), but rather its proper actualization. Thus, throwing out the inconvenient and/or (ostensibly) non-sensical dimensions of ideology--a political manuever that we tend to laud as &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot;--becomes the gesture of ideology par excellence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, &quot;reasonable&quot; positions--as well as their formal basis, the overarching injunction to &quot;Be reasonable!&quot;--are critically bankrupt. In fact, whereas we generally conceive of &quot;ideological&quot; (in the connotative sense of moronically inexorable) positions as easy to maintain--essentially a *pre-critical* position that relies on utter blindness to the empirical reality that &quot;extremism never works&quot;--Zizek&#039;s analysis of ideology as internally split leads us to precisely the opposite conclusion: &quot;ideological&quot; positions that stubbornly refuse to break from the formal mandates a given ideology, even when such mandates seem &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;unreasonable,&quot; are, in fact, the hardest positions to live by. Indeed, does not the &quot;non-ideological&quot; position--the &quot;reasonable&quot; position that willfully amends its principles on cue, and thereby facilitates the continual reinscription of hegemony--exemplify the very notion of an easy position? What could be easier than amending one&#039;s viewpoint according to the shifting winds of whatever seems &quot;reasonable&quot; (or more to the point, what &quot;expert&quot; techno-crats tell us is reasonable) at the time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#039;s at stake when Atwood takes the dominant ideologies (of her contemporaneous moment) to their extreme, utilizing their internal logic as the basis of socio-political critique? I&#039;d suggest that we should read The Handmaid&#039;s Tale as a work of &quot;critical heresy,&quot; understanding &quot;heresy&quot; as the refusal to perform the disavowals necessary to found an ideological system in practice, and simply maintaining the ideology in its pure form. The heretic is, for all intents and purposes, the figure who refuses the constitutive of auto-transgressions of systems of power, and thereby takes the logical underpinning of systemic domination to its internal (and often absurd) limit-point. The heretic thus steps outside of ideology precisely by staying within it. (This is precisely the basis of the resistive capacity that Zizek locates in hyper-conformity--stepping outside the confines of Law precisely by staying fully and uncompromisingly within them.) Atwood&#039;s heretical inclinations stem from socio-political malaise. She&#039;s not arguing that The Handmaid&#039;s Tale depicts a Utopian landscape whose conditions should be brought to their &quot;actually existing&quot; form in the real-world; rather, she&#039;s attempting to undermine the ideological fabric of her historical moment by taking it to its &quot;natural&quot; extreme. In fact, seems as though this mode of heresy--understood as the impulse to take an ideology &quot;more seriously than it takes itself&quot;--operates in many science-fictional narratives (toward equally progressive and reactionary ends, we should note). We tend to think that critique is most potent when it underscores how social arrangements are failing, but it can be far more subversive to highlight when such arrangements are working perfectly--though to horrific ends.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A mob scene</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/108</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading The Handmaid&#039;s Tale I noticed that there were many instances in which the mentality of the mob took control over that of the individual. This served as another way for the Handmaids to lose some of the individuality to the theocracy of the Republic of Gilead. What struck me most, however, was that there are also references to the mob mentality in the context of the actions of Offred&#039;s mother in the time before the republic. That the mob mentality is seen in both eras was quite an interesting similarity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways in which this mob mentality is represented in The Republic of Gilead. The Prayvaganzas and Particicution are two of the most obvious ways this mob mentality is represented. Offred herself even admits says that &quot;despite myself I feel my hands clench,&quot; and she knows she wants &quot;to tear, gouge, rend&quot; at the man (279). She understands, on the one hand, that she is being drawn into all of this, but falls for it anyway. I suppose that is all part of the mob mentality.  Another instance where I thought the effects of a mob mentality were particularly evident was the Janine/Ofwarren&#039;s birthing. The other Handmaids &quot;lean forward, tensed, the muscles in (their) backs and bellies hurt from the strain&quot; (125). They are actually experiencing, to an extent, the birth for themselves, losing themselves completely in the process. A mob or herd mentality is certainly one way for people to lose individualism, as they just become part of the crowd and follow the crowd&#039;s actions despite what they may or may not believe themselves. Through use of activities that encourage this mob mentality it seems like the theocracy of Gilead is doing a rather good job of stripping the Handmaids of some of their individualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also mentions of the mob mentality as it existed in &quot;the time before.&quot; The most notable of these is when Offred recalls the political activism of her mother in feminist activities of the late 1970s. The first instance is when she recalls the book burning that took place at the park where she though her mother was taking her to feed the ducks. There were men and women around the bonfire, &quot;some of them were chantingâ€¦ Their faces were happy, ecstatic almost&quot; (38). She evokes an image that seems reminiscent of book burnings from Fascist regimes. The second time she mentions it is in a flashback to a Domestic Science class. Her mother is in the video they watch and eventually just &quot;is part of the crowdâ€¦, (she) can&#039;t see her anymore&quot; (120). Here there is a definite sense of a loss of identity and individualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to me that Atwood would include this in both the before time and the time of the Republic of Gilead. The mob mentality seems to survive, although what it becomes in the theocracy is the opposite of what it stood for in the democracy from before. The rallies and large social gatherings are no longer for women to come together in support of new freedoms, but to come together in very traditional settings. In either case, there is a loss of self to the crowd in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t actually know anything about feminism or its history. I would like to find a way to connect this with a possible critique of the feminism of the late 1970s and early 1980s. That Atwood used a book burning I thought was very interesting, because those have such strong connections with oppressive regimes. I suppose this is another point I&#039;m interested in discussing, but don&#039;t know enough about to actually discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Nobody Gets Off Easy - In Support of Atwood&#039;s Feminism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/107</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first post on this novel, I immediately took the side of Luke, against what I perceived to be an unjust representation of men. I seem, as a side effect, to have ignited a flame war between RoseBlack, JackKerouacSucks, and the world. As a result of that war, in addition to the conversation that we had in class, I&#039;ve taken the time to look closely at my opinions on this novel. As much as it galls me to admit in a public forum, my first impression was quite narrow-minded, and reveals the basic prejudice with which I read feminist literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note to RoseBlack â€“ I think that one of the most detrimental effects of personal attacks in debate is the resulting difficulty for people to change their opinions on further thought without losing face to their attacker.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that I was strictly wrong in my first post. I still have little respect for Luke&#039;s character (though I no longer assign his opinions to Atwood). The narrator clearly loved Luke (Seeing the corpses of dissidents hanging outside, she makes sure none of them is Luke (33)), and in my opinion that colored her reactions to him, giving him a more favorable portrayal in the novel than he otherwise might have. In the first stages of their relationship, the narrator was the second woman in Luke&#039;s life. In competing with another woman, she must love more, love better in order to win the ultimate prize â€“ Luke. Because of this, I think, she is more willing to see Luke in a better light, even after he has left his wife. Once she loses her job, she doesn&#039;t go on any of the protest marches, because she must &quot;think about them, my family, him and her. [She] did think about my family. [She] started doing more housework, more baking&quot; (180). When Luke wants to have sex after she lost her job, she meekly finishes his sentence, &quot;We still have each other&quot; (182). She cannot seem to see him in a bad light, even though he does not resist anything that is happening to her, for the large part of their time together.&lt;br /&gt;
Even when he does resist, it is far too late. He has waited too long, been complicit too long, for his last gesture to make any difference. I would go so far as to say that the failure of their escape attempt is his fault. They lived in a society in which men increasingly had all the power (literally), and with that responsibility, Luke did nothing, until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in going back over my thoughts, I&#039;ve realized that Luke is by far not the only character to deserve scorn in the novel. In fact, his ability to so totally undermine his wife&#039;s way of life displays the complicity of the narrator, as well. She is very passive, throughout the book. She meekly follows the orders of Serena Joy, to get pregnant with Nick. She follows the summons of the commander, every night he calls her, and follows him to Jezebel&#039;s without resistance. There are many more examples, but these cases come after the advent of Gilead, and so it could be argued that they display only her post-oppression psyche. However, in the time before, she displayed the same passivity. When her job was taken away, she &quot;thought [she] should do something, take steps; but [she] didn&#039;t know what steps she could take&quot; (177). She is not a strong woman, by any means, and in being indecisive at that key juncture, she displays her willingness to accept what is coming, instead of face and resist it. She goes so far as to ask &quot;What was it about this that made us feel that we deserved it?&quot; (177). It is clear that her passivity stems from something deeper than the meekness ingrained by Gilead. In reading the novel from her perspective, it is easy to see the faults of others, instead of examining the way the she herself interacts with her world. I think that is one of Atwood&#039;s greatest achievements in this book, is to make the narrator&#039;s thought process seem normal, seem right, and lure us as readers into the same complicity and passivity that the narrator exhibits. The examples of Luke, of the commander, of the horrible things that men do, serve as a prod to encourage a deeper analysis, to discover the distorting lens through which the entire story is told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator is not the only one. I could go through the characters of the book, and find their faults, their role in the downfall of their nation. Nearly every character has a serious flaw, from Nick, who is &quot;indifferent to what I have to say, alive only to the possibilities of my body,&quot; to Janine, who submits to the other handmaid&#039;s blaming her for her own rape, and finally admits that it was her fault (270).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one character, in my opinion, who deserves commendation â€“ Moira. She has her flaws, of course â€“ she smokes, she constantly mooches off of others, she is overtly sexual, and doesn&#039;t frown on being a whore in Jezebel&#039;s â€“ but their obviousness belies the depth of her character. She resists everything that is done to her, and maintains her attitude even through everything she&#039;s been to before Jezebel&#039;s. Every other character in the novel has been subsumed in the culture of Gilead, and is in some way responsible for its formation. They exist in a fog of selfishness, passivity, apathy, and only Moira stands out in resistance. Even when the narrator escapes, through the fake Eye van, it is not by her will, not through her resistance, but only because she has friends in the right places, and they act for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Moira act for herself, but she brings good around her in everyone she meets. When she&#039;s escaping, she inspires people to take her in, despite the risk. In one of the only examples of actual organized resistance in the book, she is whisked toward the border by &quot;people who didn&#039;t like the way things were going&quot; (247). These are normal citizens, not people in power, and the proximity of their mention to Moira further accentuates the quality that women like her can bring to the oppressive Gilead society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moira is strong enough to resist Gilead, without the vitriol that the narrator&#039;s mother pours on everything she opposes. In fact, Moira is the feminist that Atwood believes every woman should be â€“ strong, independent, but looking out for herself as a person acting against oppression, and not a woman acting against men. And that&#039;s a feminist that I can support, wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cuaron should make Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/106</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As we keep discussing Hollywood&#039;s destruction of some of the books we&#039;ve read, I feel like I should mention that there&#039;s apparently a movie being made of Neuromancer, starring everyone&#039;s favorite emo-Jedi, Hayden Christensen, as Case, and directed by Joseph Kahn, who has offered us such masterpieces as Britney Spears&#039; video for &quot;Toxic&quot;. Hooray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because as I was rewatching Children of Men, I started thinking that the approach of Cuaron and his cinematographer is exactly what I would want in a film adaptation of Neuromancer. Children of Men is one of the most subjective movies I&#039;ve seen in recent memory--essentially every scene is built around Theo and our understanding of the scenes is as complete or limited as Theo&#039;s own. The world is minutely defined , yet the overwhelming detail and description with which it is given often makes it almost incomprehensible. At times, it recalls our world, yet at others seems incredibly foreign, and is immersed in an environment of despair and hopelessness that it feels oppressive at times. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s much of a stretch, though, to say this summarizes Neuromancer as well as Children of Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, the construction of the world in Children of Men resembles Gibson&#039;s own approach. Much of the world is seen briefly or peripherally, and we are not always given a complete explanation of what we&#039;re seeing. In Children of Men, I was struck by the fact that the special effects, which so many movies love to focus on, are here relegated to the background or seen so briefly as to be almost pointless. They are used not to call attention to anything, but are rather submerged in the deluge of visuals. When used in this way, they serve not as a means of forcing the audience to accept the reality of the world on the screen, but to transition between our world and the movie. The opening scene is an excellent example of this &quot;transition&quot;-based use of special effects (and the long single-shot that is used a lot in this movie). We begin in a coffee shop indistinguishable from the modern day, see from the date on the screen that we are in fact in 2027, and then as Theo steps outside, we see double-decker buses and whole buildings covered with enormous television screens. As he walks down the street, we are given such a deluge of  visual information that this world is &quot;different&quot; from our own, that we aren&#039;t fully capable of defining each individual part, and simply accept it as a whole (Granted, this may just be my experience of the movie, but it&#039;s my post, so there). Then, an explosion, acting almost as a period at the end of the sentence, calls attention to the transition that we have just undergone in a single shot that&#039;s less than a minute long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost exactly how Gibson offers his cyberpunk world to the reader--in the background or in fleeting glimpses. Consider descriptions like &quot;Someone scored a ten-megaton hit on Tank War Europa, a simulated airburst drowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball mushroomed overhead.&quot; (17), or &quot;Case turned his head and tried to make out the outline of the old Orly terminals, but the shuttle pad was screened by graceful blast-deflectors of wet concrete. The one nearest the window bore an Arabic slogan in red spraybomb.&quot; (102). Gibson clearly uses the fringes of the environments that he creates to distinguish them from our world, and while it may seem odd to try and say that a literary and visual style are similar, I do think that Children of Men and Neuromancer share an approach to establishing a world (I think those two descriptions of Gibson&#039;s could just as easily be descriptions of deleted scenes from Children of Men, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to disagree, as I&#039;m sure some people found the movie boring, needlessly artsy, show-offy, or lacking plot and a conclusion (all things my friends have said about it). But as we wait for the Neuromancer trailer to no doubt give us a blistering techno soundtrack, incredible special effects that make the Matrix come alive, fun one-liners that sound great even out of context, and other such standards of sci-fi adaptations, I&#039;m going to stick with Children of Men for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as Hope in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/105</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/99&quot;&gt;dreamfall17&#039;s comments about the loss of hope in Children of Men&lt;/a&gt;, I did some thinking about hope in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and stumbled on the idea â€“ which I presume to see, at least â€“ that sex is the predominant source of hope in this novel. Constantly, various male characters in the book seem to be offering illicit intercourse to Offred â€“ from the doctor offering to impregnate her (60-61) to the young Guardian who looks her in the eye, implying some sort of sexual possibility (21). Even though she does not take them up on these offers, they provide her the opportunity to imagine having the freedom to do so. These &quot;moments [that] are the rewards&quot; Offred keeps &quot;like the candy [she] hoarded as a child&quot; (21) â€“ just the minuscule breaking of rules which permits Offred to imagine &quot;what if&quot; they secretly met romantically. Similarly, the way she can make &quot;the full red skirt sway&quot; like &quot;teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach&quot; is a source of &quot;power&quot; (22). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Nick and Fred provide similar hope: the pleasure of Nick&#039;s approach in the sitting room is a refreshing pleasure: &quot;It&#039;s so good, to be touched by someone, to be felt so greedily, to feel so greedy&quot; - almost as if Luke had returned to her (99). Every encounter like this provides a hint that the desexualized â€“ or rather, desensualized â€“ society of Gilead isn&#039;t inevitable, that there are others like Offred who want to have â€“ dare I say â€“ &quot;sexy encounters&quot; with each other and will go to great lengths to do so. Just like the scene where Fred hands her a preserved copy of Vogue and watches her read through it. It&#039;s not sex â€“ but with the content of those magazines being what they are, it&#039;s still a &quot;naughty&quot; pleasure beyond just breaking the rules (157).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only actual &quot;sexual act&quot; regularly occurring in Offred&#039;s life is not hopeful. It is &quot;performed... in a perfunctory way&quot; (160) with only the emotion of embarrassment. So it&#039;s sex, but it&#039;s not sexuality. In reality, the true hope in the book is not the act of intercourse, but the act of &lt;em&gt;lovemaking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Janine</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/104</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve found myself often mulling my least favorite character in this novel: Janine.  She&#039;s the only character in the book for whom the narrator expresses clear contempt.  While she may quietly deride or ignore other figures in her life, Janine is the only person clearly within limits.  Clearly, Offred is not alone in this.  The prevailing sentiment at the Red Center is to &quot;[treat] her the way people used t treat those with no legs who sold pencils on street corners (133).&quot;  Clearly, Janine is damaged.  The young victim of a gang rape, she&#039;s easily re-traumatized by the blame ritual at the Red Center.  Yet in this new world, where women are theoretically safer from attack, Janine is no longer treated with the care or concern that are currently afforded to trauma victims in society.  Her instability constitutes a danger to those around her, and thus, she is shunned and further harmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The manner in which the cast relates to Janine brings up a point that&#039;s been made in other entries: empathy is gone from this novel.  Where Janine would be an object of sympathy in another novel, here she&#039;s &quot;a dog that&#039;s been kicked too many times,&quot; and rather than creating a bond with anyone out of shared suffering, she must turn to the Aunts, or other authorities, for occasional validation.  Yet even her quiet, safe submission is reviled.  To the narrator, she&#039;s &quot;sucky Janine&quot; the one probably crying in the back of the Prayvaganza .  Even though our narrator is highly complicit with the Gileadan regime, behaving so well as to convince Ofglen that she&#039;s pious for months, Janine&#039;s submission is always more vile.  Perhaps it&#039;s her relative comfort in her new world that makes her an object of disgust.  While other handmaids have the grace to at least be unhappy, Janine seems to truly take pleasure in the minor privileges she&#039;s granted, like a pigeon conditioned to peck at a stimulus that only results in their receiving a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janine is interesting, inasmuch as she&#039;s a character who really can&#039;t exist within a truly utopian vision.  She&#039;s so susceptible to any form of manipulation that she would unintentionally create, at least locally, a crack in any system she belonged to, unless it was so completely totalitarian that she couldn&#039;t receive any contradictory messages.  She&#039;s so terribly well-behaved within the Republic of Gilead only because the messages she receives are so completely standardized that she can follow every directive she&#039;s given.  Perhaps what&#039;s so disturbing about Janine is that she&#039;s so very well suited to the social system of Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of all three of the novels we have read so far, I like The Handmaid&#039;s Tale the best. Starship Troopers annoyed me because there were far too many soapbox moments for Heinlein and Neuromancer was difficult for me to follow because of the massive overload of descriptions of new technologies. The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is elegant. There is a certain grace to the writing and I feel that the story flows very well as a result of it. The most noteworthy aspect of the novel, at least for me, was how effective of a cautionary tale against blind trust and inaction it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwood was able to make The Handmaid&#039;s Tale a cautionary tale that was very effective in instilling a sense of fear and caution in the reader. The world that the story took place in was extremely intriguing to me because of its similarities to our world, which is one of the main reasons why this novel is so chilling. It seems that Atwood intentionally left out elaborate descriptions of future technology to make the story be as realistic and familiar as possible. On my copy of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, there is an excerpt of a review on the back cover from the Houston Chronicle that states &quot;Atwood takes many trends which exist today and stretches them to their logical and chilling conclusionsâ€¦&quot;, which I agree with. By making the events of the story seem like plausible continuations of today&#039;s trends, Atwood is able to infuse almost a sense of urgency in her story, a very real feeling of alarm. The descriptions of the downfall of the old society are extremely disturbing because they seem believable. At one point in the story, Offred was reminiscing about the very beginning of the new society. After the president was assassinated, the new order &quot;â€¦suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn&#039;t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed home at night, watching television, looking for some direction. There wasn&#039;t even an enemy you could put your finger on&quot; (174). Offred remembered that &quot;[t]hings continued in that state of suspended animation for weeks, although some things did happen. Newspapers were censored and some were closed down, for security reasons, they said. The roadblocks began to appear, and Identipasses. Everyone approved of that, since it was obvious you couldn&#039;t be too careful. They said that new elections would be held, but that it would take some time to prepare for them. The thing to do, they said, was to continue on as usual&quot; (174). The most disturbing part of the revolution was how gradual it was. The new order preyed on the public&#039;s fear, slowly gaining their trust, until finally they had complete control. Another notable incident in the novel was the arrival of Japanese tourists who were free from the constraints of Gilead. For me, that was especially disturbing because it established a contrast that revealed the existence of more &quot;civilized&quot; societies out in the world. This made the oppression of Gilead seem even tragic, since there was salvation elsewhere in the world but it was completely out of reach for the women of Gilead. Additionally, this incident also added to the plausibility of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale because it brought to mind the Middle East, in which there is a real-life situation in which women are subject to extreme oppression. It highlighted the fact that scenarios like Gilead already exist in the world, making the novel even more chilling. One last aspect of the novel that really affected me was the overall tone of the writing - it is very melancholic and numbing and was critical in making The Handmaid&#039;s Tale poignant. I could not think of any one passage that epitomizes this tone, as it is necessary to really read the entire novel to truly get a feel for what it is like. Offred is a convincingly tortured and numb soul and her narrative on her life projects the feeling of a person who is almost completely worn down by life and struggling to keep on pushing herself through the day. All of these aspects of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale make it a very powerful story.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Blunting of HT in movie version?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/102</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to focus in on this claim that the Handmaid&#039;s tale movie &#039;blunts&#039; the scariness of the book through three particular explorations: the protagonist&#039;s access to control and identity, the depiction of the handmaids&#039; indoctrination, and the protagonist&#039;s relationship with Nick. (This is in equal parts a response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92&quot; title=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92&quot;&gt;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91&quot; title=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91&quot;&gt;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recognized, the movie grants the protagonist major individuality when it reveals her name. This act of establishing identity continues throughout, though, often serving to blunt the scariness of the book. Simply through the visual nature of film the movie gives her a body type, a skin color, and an approximate age. Throughout her private meetings with the commander, this identity grows. In contrast to her belief that &quot;Whatever is silenced will clamor to be heard, though silently&quot; (p. 153), she yells and chats loudly (~54:00) and appears very relaxed with the commander. As discussed in class, Atwood closely links clothing and identity â€“ Moira escapes by donning the Aunt&#039;s garments, the red habit and wings play a huge part in defining the handmaids. In the film, Kate takes every chance she can to discard these clothes, wistfully leaning topless out the window after the first ceremony and often stripping to only her white slip when she returns to her room. Such actions contrast sharply to the novel&#039;s commentary on identity: &quot;My self is a thing I must now compose, as one composes a speech. What I must present is a made thing, not something born&quot; (p. 66). The freedom to dress as she pleases when alone (including being naked, returning to the way she was born), in addition to the exercise of more explicit control (helping Moira escape, killing the commander, as explored in the other posts) undermines the feeling of hopelessness the novel cultivated so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with dreamfall17 and wooohooo that the indoctrination scenes seem to give up their power somewhere, though I find the particulars difficult to pin down. I find the visuals of the Marthas with their high heels, conservative brown wool dresses (not very efficient for dealing with escaping prisonersâ€¦), megaphones, and small discipline sticks less than imposing. Most importantly, I feel that the film fails to demonstrate a &quot;breaking&quot; process in the handmaids. In a major way, this can&#039;t be helped, as the film must sacrifice the ability to get inside Offred/Kate&#039;s head and follow her increasingly compliant thoughts. But, forced outside the stream of consciousness, the movie speeds through the transition from women fighting back against the armed guards to agreeing passively with the Marthas. Finally, one of the main issues brought up by dreamfall17 makes a huge difference â€“ the movie&#039;s obsession with depicting the actual violence involved actually weakens the threat. A future dystopia built on violence and military force is much more easy to fight than one built on laziness and arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier writers also introduced the final point, but I wanted to try and flesh it out a little more. How might the protagonist&#039;s relationship with Nick differ in a way that decreases the threat of the novel? First, Luke is dead, completely eliminated from the picture. The lack of guilt that Offred is going through, then, decreases the tension with Nick. The movie continues to simplify their relationship when Nick takes on a seducing role instead of seeking to remain uninvolved (&quot;No romanceâ€¦ okay?&quot;). Throughout the film, nobody explicitly mentions the existence of the &quot;eyes.&quot; Without this worry that Nick might turn her in, his relationship becomes one of sexual satisfaction and salvation (sexually and from the entire system) without guilt or downside.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ten seconds&#039; worth of half babies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/101</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This Margaret Atwood book, having such an intensely gendered agenda, is sometimes confusing to the reader and the author&#039;s opinions, as expressed through different characters, seem to mislead the reader as to her own opinions about feminism and a potential utopian order for the world.  Specifically, it was difficult to piece together exactly what her mother&#039;s position had been in terms of the protests and issues like abortion and pornography, although less so with the pornography as there is the scene where Offred&#039;s mother burns it.  At one point the mother talks about being called a &quot;pronatalist&quot; by her friends because she wants to have a baby and it is difficult to tell exactly for what reasons this is such a horrific thing.  Other places in the book other characters mention the women who realized the infertility problem and gave up trying, and perhaps this is the group that Offred&#039;s mother was involved with.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to cite specific parts of this book without having excessively marked up the text while reading, as the nature of the narrative is that it hops frequently between past and present in no predictable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular passage where Offred is reliving a conversation with her mother stands out as an interesting set of beliefs about women and their place in the world.  The scene begins with a description of the mother being over for dinner around Offred and Luke.  A discussion of why she refuses to dye her hair is what launches the mother&#039;s tirade.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;What do I need it for, I don&#039;t want a man around, what use are they except for ten seconds&#039; worth of half babies.  A man is just a woman&#039;s strategy for making other womenâ€¦just do the job, then you can bugger off, I said, I make a decent salary, I can afford daycare.&quot; (120-121)&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly she has respect for men as producers of sperm, but little else.  As if to support the Commander&#039;s claim to Offred during one of their chats, the mother suggests that the feeling had gone from their society and any idea of love was the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Atwood uses the figure of the mother to play the stereotype of the feminist, the feared, illogical and outspoken feminist that most other women with the occasional feminist thought consider when denying the label &quot;feminist&quot;.  And yet even hidden amongst stereotypically hostile statements, the mother sometimes makes logical points â€“ or the beginnings of them â€“ so she is not rendered a completely ridiculous character.  Instead she could be a method for Atwood to deliver certain ideas with immunity, having a character like this to hide behind.  The reverse sexism is evident in comments from the mother such as, &quot;it&#039;s like they&#039;re permanently absent-mindedâ€¦they aren&#039;t a patch on women except they&#039;re better at fixing cars and playing football, just what we need for the improvement of the human race, right?&quot; (121).  This sentiment mirrors the statements made by men about women throughout history suggesting a lack of intelligence and a strict limitation to only a very few activities they may do better than men.  Considering the impression given by the book as a whole, it is still difficult to pin down where Atwood stands.  She does present this extreme feminist activist, but at the same time, belittles her in many ways and renders her somewhat comical.  There are many layers to the gender conflict in this book, but without more in depth study of other characters and specifically how they interplay in the mind of Offred, Atwood&#039;s intentional message remains somewhat mystifying.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>female objectification</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/100</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Atwood&#039;s The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is often described as a work of feminist literature there are no heroic, or even admirable female characters.  Instead, the cast of female characters serves as an inventory of all the ways a woman can fail in the context of oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
Serena Joy was an advocate for the return of &quot;family values,&quot; she campaigned for women to return to the domestic sphere.  If any woman should have wholeheartedly embraced the Republic of Gilead, it should have been her, but she is not happy.  Offred even wonders: &quot;Which of us is it worse for, her or me?&quot; (95). The only thing she seems to take pleasure in is abusing her power over the other women of the house.  She does have real power over them, particularly Offred, whom she can have sent to the colonies on a moment&#039;s notice.  She punishes Offred for stealing husband&#039;s attention even through the tiny practice of digging her rings into Offred&#039;s hands during the all-important &quot;ceremony.&quot;  Gilead causes makes her hypocritical and cruel.  Aunt Lydia did in fact wholeheartedly embrace the oppressive regime of the Republic of Gilead; she played an active part in its implementation and persistence as a matron of the reeducation centers. She goes beyond simply accepting the oppression, and actually adopts an oppressive role, and she relishes it: &quot;we, sitting in our rows, eyes down, we make her salivate morally.  We are hers to define&quot; (114).  Aunt Lydia is particularly repulsive in her active suppression of the &quot;right to&quot; for women, given that she herself is a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
Janine, a.k.a. Ofwarren, is similarly distasteful because of her apparent acceptance of her existence as a handmaid, even though this appearance is completely contrived.  Though in another context, we might forgive her behavior as a necessary evil for survival, here as readers it is incredibly difficult.  She supplicates herself at the feet of the regime.  She does so literally at the red center &quot;kneel[ing] at the front of the classroom, hands behind her backâ€¦ her red face and dripping nose&quot; and she admits, as to the cause of her rape at the age of 14 &quot;It was my own fault. I led them on. I deserved the pain&quot; (72).  Later, as a handmaid, she partakes in the bloodlust of the particicution.&lt;br /&gt;
Moira, at the beginning of the novel, is promising as a heroic female figure.  She escapes from the red center and becomes the handmaids&#039; &quot;fantasy&quot; (133).  Throughout her time at the Commander&#039;s house Offred fantasizes about the &quot;frisky&quot; Moira at large in the world, as a last remnant of the old world. We finally meet Moira again at Jezebels.  She is, in a certain sense, freer than Offred.  She can smoke, and drink, and have sex with women, she has face cream and drugs, she only works nights.  But she&#039;s not really free, she&#039;s a prostitute, but sells her body for only modest freedom.  She wasn&#039;t supposed to, as Offred says &quot;give in, go along, save her skin,&quot; we, like Offred want &quot;gallantry from her, swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; (249).  But even her spirit is broken.&lt;br /&gt;
The resistance of Ofwarren, our theoretical heroine, is potentially even more pathetic than that of the other women.  She&#039;s incredibly apathetic.  She spends more time making excuses than being angry.  She gives up resisting, to the point of being annoyed by Ofglen&#039;s plans for resistance, simply because of a small sexual outlet, in the form of Nick.  She, more than anyone else, has internalized her oppression.  This fact manifests itself in her descriptions of the world.  She illustrates the world around her in compulsive detail, her justification being that it keeps her mind from her oppression.  However, these descriptions show her obsession with the color red, it shows up more than any other color in her descriptions.  She describes the red of the blood-smile and the Serena Joy&#039;s tulips.  The smell of the flowers in the garden is red.  She comments on the dusk-rose velvet on the drapes in the commander&#039;s house and remembers the veiny redness of a leaf on the ground of the forest when she was captured.  For her, red is the color of her robe, representative of her definition as being functional purely on a biological level, representative of her adultery and shame.  That she should be so aware of it in her life shows how deeply she has internalized her shame.&lt;br /&gt;
Given that this novel is so often read as a work of feminist literature, clearly Atwood wasn&#039;t trying to show that women are weak or inferior to men.  Rather this pervasiveness of shame, and guilt, the fact that they all felt that they &quot;deserved it&quot; (177) goes to show just how debilitating subjugation can be.  An effective oppressive regime can cause even the freest of spirits to surrender if given a small chance for release within the system, whether that release is control over other women, uncertain sexual relief, or forbidden pleasures at a steep cost.  For this reason, the novel is just as humanist as it is feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Children of Men!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/99</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last summer I managed to read/watch both versions of Children of Men.  My faulty memory has since swept most of the details away, but armed with some wikipedia articles as refreshers, I think I can get most of the important details back again.  As an opener:  this is one of those rare pairs of book &amp;amp; adaptation that are both totally incredible without being carbon copies of one another.  And, any director/cinematographer/actor that can handle a single 5 minute shot of people dying, shooting, and blowing things up is totally out of Hollywood&#039;s league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children of Men deals with the same basic concept of &quot;creeping infertility,&quot; as Prof. Fitzpatrick put it so well.  In P.D. James&#039;s world however, this infertility was sudden and complete.  Gilead&#039;s women can still get pregnant and occasionally pop out a healthy kid, but in Children of Men, all of a sudden, babies stopped coming, and 25 years later, there still aren&#039;t any.  In most other ways, James&#039;s future society is pretty similar to Atwood&#039;s - crazy totalitarian regime, seriously repressive society, hate for non-whites, etc. etc.  The crucial difference, though, is that everyone is living without hope.  Essentially, the world is ending, and nobody&#039;s really handling it very well.  People are rapidly descending to their most animalistic instincts and/or sinking into apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I think, is where these two books are so cool to compare.  In Handmaid&#039;s Tale, there is still hope, people are still working toward some sort of purpose, though they are doing it in a pretty messed up way.  Everyday society is fairly peaceful, and everyone has something to hope for and work towards, at least.  The people of Children of Men are facing a world that, in 50 years or so, will straight-up have no people in it.  When faced with that despair (which the film captures with SO much more subtlely and skill than the Handmaid&#039;s Tale movie), I&#039;m not sure what I personally would do.  What&#039;s the point of learning, writing, creating art, making money, doing anything, really, if anything new you manage to bring to the world will a) be buried under the far more important issue of the spieces&#039;s slow death and b) won&#039;t last past the final human&#039;s memory anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death is pretty flippin scary for most people, but knowing that a kind of immortality could be achieved, that you could improve or change the world somehow if you did something cool enough, is comforting.  Knowing that you&#039;re going to become completely irrelevant in the near future no matter what you do is probably a motivation-killer for a lot of people.  How James&#039;s society dealt with this impending doom is pretty depressing but, I think, definitely a possible scenario.  People are basically living as animals, killing their elderly - heck, killing each other, too.  With the end in sight, all of the worst bits of our nature come out into the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scenario I like much better is in Alan Lightman&#039;s book, Einstein&#039;s Dreams.  In one of the short stories, the world has a set day on which it will end - fairly similar to Children of Men.  In Lightman&#039;s world, businesses and schools shut down, but knowing that everyone&#039;s going to die soon anyway, that they are all headed together to the same end, the world&#039;s population unites, more or less, and the world ends in piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wonder is which scenario is more likely, should some such event put us in some kind of similar situation.  Will the worst of human nature come out, or the best?  Or will we just toodle along, just as we always do, and just sort of fade unspectacularly away?  I&#039;m a pessimist who wants to be an optimist, so I&#039;m curious about what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Deuteronomy 22:23-29</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/98</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Context: On pgs. 278-280, a Guardian is convicted of rape and subsequently punished.  Aunt Lydia says that the &quot;&#039;penalty for rape...is death.  Deuteronomy 22:23-29...one woman was pregnant and the baby died&#039;&quot; (179).&lt;br /&gt;
Consistent with the other Biblical references in the novel, Deuteronomy 22:23-29 is conveniently condensed to serve the purpose Aunt Lydia wants it to serve.  (see below) The convicted Guardian tries to say something, but all he can get out is &quot;&#039;I didn&#039;t...&#039;&quot; (279).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bloodlust that ensues is alarming.  Someone else blogged about the colors red and blue (I didn&#039;t read the full blog entry yet, so sorry if this repeats anything), and this passage definitely has a lot of red imagery in it. The women swarm forward like an angry red tide and proceed to viciously beat the man.   This act of violence is easy to commit because they have dehumanized the Guardian; he&#039;s likened to a &quot;half-dead rat&quot; (279) and &quot;He has become an it&quot; (280).  Ironically, the Handmaids have also become beasts.  Offred admits that there is an urge to &quot;tear, gouge, rend&quot; (279), flare nostrils, and growl.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident reminded me a lot of Heart of Darkness: the Africans were thought of as animals; but in treating the Africans so cruelly, the white explorers dehumanized themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guys were wondering what that section of Deuteronomy says, according to the Bible (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibleresources.bible.com&quot; title=&quot;www.bibleresources.bible.com&quot;&gt;www.bibleresources.bible.com&lt;/a&gt;, King James version):   23If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 24Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour&#039;s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.  25But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel&#039;s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Prisoners in their own system</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/97</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale depicts a world in which women are highly subservient to men, some even to the point that they only exist to fulfill the biological process of reproduction necessary for the survival of the species.  Such is the lot of our protagonist Offred, and it is from her we get our entire perspective of the civilization of Gilead, a society in which she and many other women are very much prisoners and slaves.  This society is very strictly controlled and repulsive to our modern ideals of freedom and justice within a nation, and shares some striking points in common with Nazi Germany.  Even more striking and frightful is Atwood&#039;s claim that most of what was written, the trends, the occurrences, the injustices, was grounded in real events of her modern era, the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels with Nazi culture are prevalent and plentiful.  Gilead is a very homogenous society in which everyone is Caucasian, a somewhat lessened version of Hitler&#039;s Aryan Master Race, but continues to exclude further down by relegating its citizenry to those of a single Christian (I believe it&#039;s Christian, I may be wrong) faith.  We even find persecution of Jews in Gilead, where was composed &quot;the Jewish repatriation scheme, with the result that more than one boatload of Jews was simply dumped into the Atlanticâ€¦ from what we know of [those in charge], this would not have bothered [them] much,&quot; (307).  Much like Hitler&#039;s rallies and grandiose speeches, Gileadean subjects are sometimes called to mass gatherings to listen to propaganda and further entrench themselves in the customs and offenses of the nation as a whole.  At a Prayvaganza, the Commander &quot;ascends the steps to the podium, which is draped with a red cloth embroidered with a large white-winged eyeâ€¦ &#039;Today is a day of thanksgiving,&#039; he begins, &#039;a day of praise&#039;â€¦ a speech about victory and sacrifive.  Then there&#039;s a long prayer, about unworthy vessels, then a hymn,&quot; (218).  Now, political rallies and the like are by no means a strictly Nazi practice, but the effects and levels of participation observed in those of Gilead do hold similarities.  In Nazi Germany, such rallies were used to brainwash large amounts of people to accept the oppression and eventual slaughter of countless Jews and minorities, making them accessories toÂ¬ the commission of crimes against humanity.  &quot;I&#039;ve leaned forward to touch the rope in front of me, in time with the others, both hands on itâ€¦ then placed my hand on my heart to show my unity with the Salvagers and my consent, and my complicity in the death of this woman,&quot; (276).  In one instance they even go as far as to rend a man to pieces with their bare hands upon provocation by their superiors.  One common argument coming out of Nazi Germany after the war was that people had essentially brainwashed themselves or had been brainwashed to accept the genocidal efforts as something that had to be done, much at the behest and influence of the state, and that they weren&#039;t entirely sure how they could have done such things, but such can be the power of speech and gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final real point I want to make is that, at least in this early Gileadean culture, women don&#039;t seem to be the only captives.  Granted they&#039;ve got it much worse off, but from the sparse scenes we are given that include males that are a part of the culture, it seems that they too are very much prisoner to their own system.  The Commander, obviously rather high in the social strata, finds the need to escape the rigidity of the world he helped to craft, smuggling Offred, his newfound mistress to a not so secret brothel.  &quot;&#039;Well?&#039; he says. &#039;What do you think of our little club?&#039; &#039;I thought this sort of thing was strictly forbidden.&#039; I say. &#039;Well, officially,&#039; he says. &#039;But everyone&#039;s human, after all,&#039;&quot; (236-7).  The commander admits need for change and the enactment of behaviors not allowed in Gilead, and it appears many other high ranking officials (all male of course) feel the same way, as the brothel is extremely busy.  Nick, a servant to The Commander, similarly has his vices in this highly controlled society, conducting frequent trysts with Offred that could cost him his life, then going to the ultimate illegal lengths by not only being part of the Gileadean equivalent of a secret service, The Eyes, and a rebel faction known as Mayday at the same time.  It is even speculated in the epilogue that this double life caused his downfall, for as &quot;Ofglen&#039;s association with Mayday had been discovered, he himself was in some jeopardy, for as he well knew, as a member of the eyes, Offred herself was certain to be interrogated,&quot; and so he helped Offred escape, when &quot;he could of course have assassinated her himself, which might have been the wiser course, but the human heart remains a factor,&quot; (311).  Both the commander and Nick help create and enforce the system that entraps and removes the freedoms of womankind, but as we see, their own emotions and humanity is similarly imprisoned to drastic degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last little aside, I&#039;d just like to call to everyone&#039;s attention the passage on page 186, in which Offred thinks, &quot;The pen between my fingers is sensuous, alive almost, I can feel its powerâ€¦ Pen Is Envy, Aunt Lydia would sayâ€¦ I envy the Commander his pen.&quot;  Seriously, &quot;Pen Is Envy?&quot;  Yeah, that&#039;s not obvious at all.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>knowledge is power</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/96</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(I have a different edition of the book, so I apologize that the page numbers are off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, Atwood clearly makes the argument that knowledge is crucial to empowering individuals. Certainly, there is a reason education is such a big deal in our society--we believe that knowledge empowers people, makes them better citizens. It is through knowledge, or rather, the denial of it, that the totalitarian regime takes over Gilead. Even the very first steps towards changing the society, if people had known what was happening they might have been more compelled to doing something about it, resisting the new regime. When Offred is denied her bank account and loses her job, neither she nor Luke has any idea why, so the easiest assumption is that it is a simple and quickly fixed mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is the undercurrent that they don&#039;t actually want to know what is going on because if they do, they will be compelled to do something about it. There is the subconscious denial of responsibility. &quot;What you don&#039;t know won&#039;t tempt you, Aunt Lydia used to say. Maybe I don&#039;t really want to know what&#039;s going on. . . . Maybe I couldn&#039;t bear to know.&quot; (252) Of course, simply the fact that she is justifying an Aunt&#039;s words makes the reader pause a bit. Yes, &quot;The Fall was a fall from innocence to knowledge,&quot; (252) but who&#039;s to say we aren&#039;t better off knowing? Who&#039;s to say Eden was perfect? Maybe, in fact, Eden was dystopic rather than utopic. (I&#039;m sure there has been literature about this very idea, but I am not well read so can&#039;t name anything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the changes made in Gilead seemed rather a Fall themselves (as opposed to a rise, though definitely a return to ignorance)--a fall of democracy, a fall of equality, a fall of freedom of every sort (except freedom *from* certain things). &quot;That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary.&quot; (225) I can&#039;t imagine anything that would justify suspending the Constitution and yet people knew no better than that it was &quot;temporary&quot; (how temporary?) and knew not how to fight such power. Offred also remembers that &quot;Yesterday was July the fourth, which used to be Independence Day, before they abolished it.&quot; (257) The only reason to abolish such a holiday is to say that independence is not good for society, should not be celebrated, should not even be remembered. Perhaps in the later generations of Gilead, when they will not have ever heard of Independence Day, they will not even know the idea of independence. The farther away from knowledge the people become, the easier it is to control them. After all, one cannot miss what one does not know exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The totalitarian government of Gilead definitely made sure to keep knowledge away from the majority of its citizens. The women are not allowed to read or write--all signs are comprised of symbols--books and magazines were banned and burned, only an elite few know anything about this war that seems to be going on, and real conversations are generally not allowed amongst the handmaids. What is perhaps the most detrimental to Offred&#039;s adjustments and coping is this lack of conversation. Humans are a social bunch, and without anyone to connect to, Offred must stay within the too-tight confines of her mind. There are those, of course, with whom she shares opinions of the new regime, such as the original Ofglen--but there, again, knowledge is the main factor. There is almost no way of knowing those who are &quot;true believers&quot; and buy in to all the new rules versus those who are also wishing there was a way to change things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I think this is why the novel can be so frustrating at times. Atwood shows us just what it&#039;s like not to know what&#039;s going on around you by not explaining the society of Gilead for a long time, and then, in implicit bits and pieces. It&#039;s really annoying not knowing, and this helps the reader see more clearly what Offred--as well as the majority of her society--is going through.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Offred&#039;s mother</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/95</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuman&#039;s article &quot;Just a Backlash&quot; forced me to do a closer reading of the various representations of feminism in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale.  I was most taken aback by Atwood&#039;s strong resistance to being labeled a feminist.  While she fittingly points out that &quot;No one who observes society can fail to make observations that are feminist&quot; (858), she is also quick to critique the more extreme form of feminism.  She claims, &quot;If practical, hardline, anti-male feminists took over and became the government, I would resist them.&quot;  Atwood&#039;s self-identification as a &#039;tamer&#039; feminist brings up the question of what the female characters within the novel truly represent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though her physical presence in the book is minimal, I found Offred&#039;s mother to be one of the most interesting characters.  With her book burnings and banner protests, the mother personifies the 1970&#039;s feminist.  She adamantly claims that there is no room for a man in her life; she asks Offred, &quot;What use are they except for 10 seconds&#039; worth of half babies&quot; (12).  The mother is the feminist who Atwood never wants to be associated with.  The mother thinks herself superior to men, at the very least in an intellectual sense.  She credits them for their ability to fix cars and play football but not much else.  Offred&#039;s mother does not seek equality for men and women; rather she would most likely be content if the male race was wiped out completely.  However, she made a comment to Offred that struck me as sad and contradictory.  Only a few lines after criticizing Offred for not understanding all that had been done for female rights, Offred paints quite a different picture of her mother.  She writes, &quot;Sometimes she would cry.  I was so lonely, she&#039;d say.  You have no idea how lonely I was.  And I had friends, I was a lucky one, but I was lonely anyway&quot; (122).  I could not help but imagine that she was so lonely because she did not have a man.  With this statement I am hardly attempting to take the stance that every straight woman needs a man in her life to feel complete.  But I do believe her admittance to feeling lonely gives the mother a side that does perhaps desire a man.  She says she had friends but they were clearly not enough.  She needed a space filled in her life and often this space is fulfilled by the presence of a man to love or at least care for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is not much more to read into this brief moment of vulnerability, but I suspect Atwood is criticizing the man-hating feminist that does not necessarily seek progression into equal rights.  No matter how much feminists may categorize men as chauvinists only driven by sex and sports, ultimately, they can not fully deny the need for men.  Fine, Offred&#039;s mother knows that men are needed to reproduce but she is less willing to admit that at times, she missed the simple touch of a man.  While they clearly had different objectives in mind, in some ways, I found the Aunts to be an extreme representation of the 1970s feminist.  Of course they were strict enforcers of the rules of a government that oppressed women.  But they also encouraged the girls to take advantage of the sexual control they had over men.  Even in the disgusting scene where the girls were encouraged to blame Janine for being raped, the Aunts wanted the girls to take responsibility for their roles as sexual beings.  Men were depicted as little more than sperm donors.  Clearly the Aunts are not shining images of feminist ideals but it is worth considering them as a terrifying depiction of that &quot;hardline&quot; feminist taking over the government.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Better Protected or More Oppressed?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/94</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously the central issue of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale has to do with the role of women in society, especially in the future, considering how much of a stark contrast there is between the world of today and the world of tomorrow portrayed in Atwood&#039;s novel.  However, to actually quantify and sort out the differences between these two situations takes a bit more thought and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we could easily catalogue the concrete changes: women cannot own property or have a job, and are thus basically restricted to the home...either as a servant, a wife, or a handmaid (in coarser terms, a baby factory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand are the implications that some of these changes have had on the role of women.  However, I think that the way women have taken the change...and how they feel about their places....is probably the most important topic here, because the novel can easily be interpreted differently depending on how the people involved accept things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime example: Offred.  As a handmaid whose sole purpose in society is to reproduce, it would seem to us that she as a person has been desecrated by the established regime.  In our eyes, she is basically used by people of power around here simply for the &quot;gift&quot; she has (if one can call it such), her ability to reproduce.  For anyone with an ounce of morality, this situation just seems wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is the accepted norm for everyone....even for the handmaids themselves it seems.  Or at least, the established society would make one believe so.... However, Offred tells us in subtle ways that perhaps things are not so beneficial.  She continually has thoughts of the &quot;old days&quot; back with her husband Luke, when she had freedom, despite never outright saying she wished better for herself.  ....Until, that is, Ofglen steps across the line, clearing stating her rebellion on page 168, and it is obvious that Offred agrees with Ofglen fully....and not just a passing &quot;Wish things were better&quot; attitude that appeared in earlier chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, it seems that at least some of the women do not enjoy the change in role.  Considering that the structure of society is advertised as being safer and better protective for women, it is ironic that the same structure would put them into an even worse form of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that the society IS optimal considering the circumstances...but to me it does not appear that much, if any, benefit has come from the differences in Atwood&#039;s novel.  One would hope (and probably assume) that her intention for writing it was to promote gender equality or at least freedom...and not captivity as Offred experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Empathy for a Handmaid</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/93</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve said a lot already about some pretty powerful issues that can&#039;t be ignored in this book.  Here, I think I&#039;d like to talk about something that isn&#039;t perhaps as critical to understanding the novel&#039;s implications for our own real, modern world, at first glance or otherwise.  I&#039;m interested in how the novel deal with empathy; as a human characteristic, as a potentially gendered characteristic, its sentimentalization (or lack thereof), and the ways that these understandings of empathy might inform society, dystopic or otherwise.  To be clear, I really think this novel makes a point of *not* sentimentalizing empathy (or sympathy), and by doing so seems to imply that it may not be a natural (real? easy?) human instinct.  This is quite different form the way that so many narratives, Hollywood or otherwise, are formed, in which it is empathy that finally breaks through a villain&#039;s shell or that sets the hero apart from the rest and make him/her attractive to others.  The Handmaid&#039;s Tale the film is hugely different from the book in this respect I think, and therefore I&#039;m going to ignore it for now.&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the things we talked about in the last class on Monday (and is discussed extensive on this blog) was a particular scene at the end of chapter 28 (my page 236, probably not yours), one of many flashbacks, in which Offred is remembering Luke&#039;s reaction and attempt at comforting her when she ends the day without a job and with no property whatsoever to her name.  Some people are troubled by the depiction of Luke here, either as unfeeling and chauvinistic (he doesn&#039;t care enough about her problems to think twice about asking for sex), or as an unfair and emotionally warped depiction of him by an upset Offred.  Either of these interpretations seems to me potentially to make a comment on the gendered nature of empathy, depending on whether it is Luke or Offred who is incapable of understanding the feelings and motivations of the other.  I&#039;m more inclined to understand Luke in this scene as unable to understand, despite his intentions.  His actions read more to me like someone who wants to offer comfort, but is unsure how in the face of feeling he cannot comprehend.  Offred herself was just as complacent before that day when confronted with signs of the coming horrors, feeling that she was watching stories &quot;About other women, and the men who did such things were other men.  None of them were the men we knew. The newspaper stories were like dreams to us, bad dreams dreamt by others&quot; (74).  In fact, later in the novel Offred almost seems to be troubled by the universal ability to ignore and distance: in Gilead marketplace with Ofglen, Offred witnesses one of the few public disturbances in the novel, a scene in which a seeming innocent bystander is whisked away by the Eyes in a brutal maneuver.  Shortly thereafter the traffic resumes as though nothing had happened, and Offred notes that all she feels is relief that it wasn&#039;t her (220).&lt;br /&gt;
	I find that the most frightening characteristic of this novel is the isolation that every citizen of Gilead, and the isolation that we experience through Offred&#039;s eyes.  She constantly dwells on how she does not (and can not) know what her companion, be Ofglen, Serena Joy, The Commander, or Nick, is feeling.  One almost expects some relief of this emotional isolation to come of Offred&#039;s interactions with the Commander, since he seems to imply that understanding and complicity is what he seeks, and Offred is there because his wife and he &quot;Don&#039;t seem to have much in common, these days&quot; (203).  However, though Offred and the commander become more human to one-another, there is no genuine understanding of the mentality of the other. &quot;For him, I must remember, I am a whim.&quot; (205).  The most Offred can seem to say of any newfound understanding of or connection with the commander is that &quot;He is of interest to me, he occupies space, he is more than a shadow&quot; (210).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 3</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished watching the movie adaptation of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and I have to confess that I was pretty disappointed.  Obviously, Professor Fitzpatrick had warned us about the screenwriter&#039;s not-so-feminist stance, but I was still pretty shocked.  Some of the parts that I loved in the book came off as cheesy and over the top.  For example, the Salvaging, one of the most chilling sections of the novel, had very little power in the  film version.  There was no &quot;energy buildingâ€¦[no] tremor of readiness and anger&quot; (278).  As hard as the film tried, it simply could not capture the anger that is so palpable in the book.  Much of this failure came from the portrayal of the character of Offred.  The film took Offred&#039;s position as a mother and ran with it, forcing her into an overly female role.  At the same time, she was much more dominant than the Offred of the novel, even physically striking out at the Commander.  This contradiction, for me, made Gilead&#039;s power much less horrifying: Atwood&#039;s Offred finds herself internalizing her protestations, too terrified to strike out.  Her power is too obvious in the movie, and it helps make the Republic of Gilead seem less like an oppressive society and more like a game.&lt;br /&gt;
	Much of this surreal quality comes from the fact that the movie missed many of the subtler parts of Offred&#039;s character.  Rather than an essentially human character, the Offred of the film is excruciatingly female.  I never felt like Atwood&#039;s Offred was ever overbearingly womanly.  At times, she seems intensely judgmental of the women around her: at the birthing ceremony, she describes the other women as &quot;twittering,&quot; a condescending term (126).  However, despite her snarky comments about the other women in the society, she also finds herself forced into identifying with them.  At the same birthing ceremony, Offred&#039;s breasts leak &quot;fake milk&quot; and she &quot;holds in her lap a phantom, a ghost baby&quot; (127). The protagonist&#039;s side comments and strong character emphasize the overpowering effects that the society&#039;s brainwashing can have upon its members.&lt;br /&gt;
	The movie seemed to pull Offred&#039;s character in two separate directions: she is both strong and separate from the society and yet almost childlike in her naivete.  This contradiction almost completely destroyed the power of the novel.  In the Salvaging ceremony, Offred is shown standing apart, her look of horror blatantly obvious.  Moments like this ruined the terror of Gilead&#039;s society.  I feel like the Offred of the film constantly made motions or looks that would have gotten her executed in the Gilead of the novel.  Atwood&#039;s Offred is not a hero: she recognizes her perilous situation in the house and Serena&#039;s longing &quot;to slap [her] face&quot; (16).  She acts cautiously, hiding her urge to &quot;laugh, shriek with laughter, fall of [her] chair&quot; at the Commander&#039;s request to play Scrabble (138).  Instead, she replies &quot;as if indifferent,&quot; realizing that the Commander holds her completely in his power and that an admission of interest could get her killed (139).  The Offred of the film is anything but humble and submissive: she is intensely defiant and taunts the Commander.  The film&#039;s representation of their relationship, with its flirtatious teasing and lack of respect, forces its audience to treat them as equal to one another rather than recognizing the Commander&#039;s superior position.&lt;br /&gt;
	There are obvious differences in pure events between the film and the movie: of course, the stabbing of the Commander is the most blatant.  Again, this action serves to portray Offred as  heroic character, fighting back against the oppression of Gilead.  However, the Offred of the novel is much more realistic: to her, becoming a handmaid is her way to &quot;give in, go along, save her skin&quot; (249).  The movie lost the sense of desperation and helplessness that is so obvious throughout Offred&#039;s story, and I feel as though that loss prevented the film from having the power of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>god, hollywood sucks at life.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that this was the first week the book and the movie could be so directly contrasted, the differences between literary and Hollywood conceptions of what makes a good story really struck me.  My generalized conclusion:  Hollywood is SO LAME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I found the widespread tendency toward inaction especially disturbing, but also the most relevant to today.  Some things Offred said â€“ &#039;I took too much for granted; I trusted fate, back then,&#039; for example, or &#039;We lived by ignoring.  Ignoring isn&#039;t the same as ignorance, you have to work at itâ€¦&#039; â€“ struck me as very true and real (27, 53).  Laziness, or apathy, or ignoring, is a pretty powerful force.  It seems almost plausible that the country would allow a force to slowly gather power as the population ignored it until it was too late, when it would slip fairly quietly into control.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laziness is not an enemy that translates very well onto the screen, though, so the movie changes it up, and destroys much of the story&#039;s power in the process.  That a country as populous as the United States could be subdued purely by military force, which is what seemed implied by the movie, is so much more unlikely (and therefore distant and safe to its audience).  Atwood constructs a scenario that one could see actually occurring; the movie is just a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, most people do not seem too pleased with the new arrangement; the second scene in particular depicts a forced subduing.  They are reminiscent of film portrayals of Nazi Germany, with soldiers corralling the undesirables into trains and trucks like cattle (as oh-so-subtle truck with the crossed-out label &#039;livestock&#039; points out) and carting them off to certain death.  The book distances itself from such disturbing scenes, making it easier for the reader to slip into the same apathy that Offred does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the people fight what is happening to them â€“ they make the soldiers shove them around, they try to escape, they resist, instead of just standing around as this new totalitarian regime is built around them.  Throughout the movie, there are references to the ongoing war that indicate a more widespread discontent and organized resistance than the book.  Not only are the rebels powerful enough to disrupt fruit shipments from California and Florida, the handmaids know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movie, Kate (she has a name! an independent identity!) is quite a bit more feisty, as well.  She is not submissive â€“ at least any more than so many Hollywood leading ladies are.  She challenges the commander, falls into an affair with Nick at an absurd speed, and even helps Moira bind and gag Aunt Lydia when Moira escapes.  She is a Hollywood hero â€“ she takes risks, stands out, does what others are too cowardly to.  Atwood&#039;s Offred admits she does nothing and is reduced to reveling in the power she has, &#039;[the] power of a dog bone, passive but there&#039; (30).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie gives her much more motivation to resist.  For one thing, there is still a sense of community among the characters; they do not exist in their own little bubbles of fear and isolation.  In the book, Offred does not trust anyone, fearing Nick to be an Eye and saying of Rita, &#039;Why tempt her friendship?&#039; (15).  Kate has to fear only the soldiers and the government they represent.  Just as powerful, but at least she knows who they are.  They don&#039;t hide as handmaids, wives, or drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Offred of the book can describe the Ceremony scenes with an almost clinical distance. &#039;Below [my skirt] the Commander is fucking.  What he is fucking is the lower part of my bodyâ€¦rape [doesn&#039;t] cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven&#039;t signed on for&#039; (121).  The Ceremony of the film reads much more like a rape scene, with Kate crying loudly though most of the first one, and the Commander is sort of a lecherous old man â€“ easy to hate him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film, her life is bad enough, and her motivation (finding her daughter) strong enough that NOT acting seems inconceivable.  The book&#039;s Offred is not in a living hell so much as in a vaguely unpleasant place, and the risks of leaving it are much too high.  Inaction is much easier, and it&#039;s a pretty steep and short slope from inaction to apathy to acceptance.  Atwood&#039;s world is a much scarier, and much realer, place.  Hollywood cannot deal with anything less than five steps removed from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>gambling</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/90</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To me, Atwood&#039;s &quot;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot; is, in large part, a cautionary tale about the dangers of apathy.  It is difficult to see the Republic of Gilead as anything but a totalitarian regime, with only the interests of the very few at heart.  Women are entirely subservient to men.  The men they service are limited to the aging and supposedly infertile commanders, leaving the majority of men with very little contact with women.  Basically, the majority of the population is disenfranchised.  However, despite the obvious lack of satisfaction there is little resistance against the system, further aggravating the situation.  It isn&#039;t until the end of the book that a sliver of hope for change appears.&lt;br /&gt;
	While the lack of resistance from men is more understandable than for women, because they aren&#039;t subjugated in the same way, the extent of male apathy in the text seems almost ludicrous.  Why would young men tolerate nearly no contact with women?  One would think their sexual drive alone would be enough to convince them that this is no way to run a country.  They don&#039;t benefit from female subservience, and are unlikely to ever do so, so what else compels them to support the system?&lt;br /&gt;
It seems to me that the system that Atwood proposed is paralleled by the culture of selling hard drugs.  In reality, one doesn&#039;t make much as a crack dealer, and the dangers involved are huge.  Getting caught by the police has significant consequences, and there&#039;s always the possibility that a disgruntled customer will try to get all of what you&#039;ve got without paying for it.  In reality, most dealers could get a better paying job at Burger King.  However, as you move up the status ladder, to relationships closer to the distributor, the quality of life improves drastically, with a radically higher income and much more safety.  Yet, the likelihood of going from dealer to a more luxurious job is extremely low.  This system, which presents the faint possibility of a great reward, keeps many thousands of dealers selling in very poor conditions in the same way that a slot machine keeps a gambler occupied for hours.  The same kind of mentality seems to keep the men of Gilead in check.  When Kate passes guards, she imagines &quot;They think [] of doing their duty and a promotion to the Angels, and of being allowed possibly to marry, and then, if they are able to gain enough power and live to be old enough, of being allotted a Handmaid of their own.&quot; (22)  The tantalizing thought of a handmaid of their own seems to be enough to focus the men on their duties.&lt;br /&gt;
Remarkably, the women of this culture seem to be in the inverse of the male situation.  All their rights are deprived, and they have been put into a hierarchy where even the most privileged woman, the wife, is limited to domestic issues.  Despite this, these women are unwilling to break norms, or resist the system, because they don&#039;t want to appear disloyal.  When asked by the Japanese tourists if she&#039;s happy, Kate responds that she is, rationalizing &quot;what else can I say?&quot; (28)  While the response can be seen as reasonable in this situation, it reveals a system of thought which is complacent.  Of course she can say other things.  She merely sees the consequences of rebelling, even a little, as unacceptable.  The fact that she is mentally unwilling to face the consequences of an unjust regime shows that the regime is in complete control over her.  This seems to be the trend for almost all the women in Gilead.  The consequences of disobeying are to lose priority status in the society, and risk becoming an &quot;Unwoman&quot;.  It is specifically because the gamble has so much at stake that women are so hesitant to resist.&lt;br /&gt;
For both women and men, it seems that self interest has inhibited the resistance which would benefit both sexes.  Clearly, their care for their individual future outweighs the power of any sort of moral conviction.  While there are a few counterexamples, it seems to me that this book is pointing out how risk operates on the different sexes if they are allowed to diverge, the developments from that divergence produce apathy which causes seemingly intractable social stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Buggery in Ender&#039;s Game</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/88</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether anyone else read Ender&#039;s Game with Starship Troopers this semester--or had read it before--but I just read this interesting post on the Feminist SF blog--I was actually linked to it from Paper Cuts--about Orson Scott Card&#039;s winning the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which, I also learned, is some sort of important lifetime achievement award for YA lit. The thrust of the post is that Card is a horrible bigot and shouldn&#039;t be touted as a credible voice for young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a link to the post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot; title=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot;&gt;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&lt;/a&gt;. It has some quotations from essays and stuff that Card has written that are really awful and disgustingly homophobic. If you&#039;re interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, I thought, was this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;al Says:&lt;br /&gt;
January 29th, 2008 at 2:32 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i knew he was a homophobe before i read ender&#039;s game, but i still read it on someone&#039;s recommendation. i thought it was pretty interesting that the bad guys were referred to as &quot;buggers&quot; and that it found it&#039;s way to being a slur amongst the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, i know they were &#039;bugs&#039;. but there is no way osc didn&#039;t know what buggery (and buggers) was.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can&#039;t fathom how I missed that one. The phrase is so clearly sexual. And there&#039;s loads of (occasionally naked) homoerotic boy-play in the Battle School. Most of it more or less innocuous, though, which is interesting, given Card&#039;s self-professed beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s anything productive to be done with this in Starship Troopers--the word in Ender&#039;s Game is also clearly a reference to the bad guys in ST--but if anyone wants to take a shot at it, I&#039;d be interested to see what we could come up with, readings-wise.  We talked a lot about gendered readings of ST, but not so much about the potential for queer readings. Not sure how much potential there is, but I thought I&#039;d throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In the vein of infertility in sci-fi...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/87</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in class, the movie Aeon Flux covers some very similar points but deals with the ideas of infertility in a very different way.  While The Handmaid&#039;s Tale deals mainly with white infertility in a single country, Aeon Flux addresses the idea of global infertility, not blamed on either gender, and the increasingly strict and regulated society that results from that infertility.  I feel like it was passed over when it came out, but I think it&#039;s pretty relevant to both The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and Children of Men.  Definitely more socially classified as science fiction as well with the presence of exciting technology.  It&#039;s also a really entertaining movie and I&#039;m a sucker for the love story.  So really no reason not to watch it, I know you&#039;ll all be dying to procrastinate at some point this week.  Enjoy :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Moira--Freeeeeedooooommmmmm</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/86</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;*I think I have a different addition, so my page numbers are probably very wrong. Sorry about that*&lt;br /&gt;
I was unbelievably excited about the existence of Handmaid&#039;s Tale on this syllabus.  For one, it&#039;s one of my favorite books (apologies to the people who hate Atwood&#039;s constant metaphors).  Also, I didn&#039;t even think about it as being Science Fiction.  After reading Suvin&#039;s article, however, I had to redefine my definition of Science Fiction (at least a little).  Handmaid&#039;s Tale does seem to fit into his definition rather nicely, plopping its readers into the middle of a society that both could have come from ours and is shockingly different.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Offred doesn&#039;t really seem to fit into either of the two stereotypes we discussed in class: she&#039;s certainly not an ass-kicker, and she doesn&#039;t scream &quot;damsel in distress,&quot; either.  I wonder if this is at least partly due to Margaret Atwood&#039;s own gender.  However, I was interested to notice the character of Moira, who does seem to, at first, fall into that first category.  Offred even says, &quot;Moira was our fantasy&quot; (133).  The idealized female moves from a masculine fantasy to a feminine one, representing escape and freedom.  However, we later discover that she really is a fantasy for both genders, acting as a prostitute in the club the Commander haunts.    Offred&#039;s dream of &quot;gallantry from [Moira], swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; is lost in the prostitute that she&#039;s become (249).   Offred and Moira take two separate paths, but they both wind up serving men, and Moira&#039;s track is, societally, much more degrading. Handmaid&#039;s Tale takes the one female character who seems to have a dollop of a chance at freedom and puts her in the most degrading possible job.&lt;br /&gt;
However, her prostitution reminds me a lot of Molly&#039;s selling her body to get her implants: Moira sells her own body to get the few scraps of freedom that she can, admitting that she&#039;s &quot;not a martyr&quot; (249).  In some ways, Moira&#039;s character shows the perversion that her society has put into the minds of its women: the only escape is through sex, and that really is no escape at all.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as I was toodling along and reading Handmaid&#039;s tale, I realized that I didn&#039;t know the protagonist&#039;s name, so I wiki-ed it.  I found it out, but hadn&#039;t yet gotten to the part with the explanation of WHY she was called Offred, so I just figured Atwood had made it up.  What I noticed about it was how similar it was to the word &#039;offered.&#039;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think this could possibly be a coincidence; Offred is &#039;offered&#039; to so many people.  She is offered to the Commander, as well as Serena Joy and the rest of the household, to Nick, to the Eyes at the end of the novel, to the larger machinations of the society.  She, as the narrator and representative of all the handmaids of Gilead, is offered to future scholars (and the reader) as a way to gain insight into the women&#039;s minds of that time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of this, she &#039;is offered&#039;; she never offers herself.  There is a passivity in this offering that is, I think, very similar to the one that she berates herself about in the time before.  Her little rebellions and transgressions, though they do carry a serious penalty, are ultimately pretty minor.  Whether it&#039;s laziness, inertia, the paralyzing power of fear, or something else, she pretty much lets everyone else decide her fate for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t mean to judge her actions or imply that she should have done something different, but she does let others offer her up with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Luke&#039;s Disgusting Response - A Rant.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/84</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the most viscerally affecting passage in HT was at the very end of chapter 28, near the end of the narrator&#039;s description of the fundamentalist takeover in the time before. In it, Luke responds to the narrator losing her job and all her rights without really blinking an eye. He still wants to make love, and can&#039;t understand why the narrator doesn&#039;t want to. He says &quot;We still have...&quot; and she finishes &quot;We still have each other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s entirely not the point. Luke clearly doesn&#039;t understand his wife, or respect her abilities, or have any sense of what his entire nation has lost by denying fully half of its population the ability to productively contribute. I know it&#039;s an entirely irrational reaction, but I can&#039;t help but be personally offended by the way that Luke just rolls over while his wife&#039;s humanity is taken away. I think that betrayal is worse than any other described in the book, and the fact that a man so blithely commits it is, I believe, a direct insult to men. It is that kind of anti-male bullshit that has given me a knee-jerk negative response to feminism, and I believe weakens the movement as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>thoughts on HT</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/83</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is different from the other two books we&#039;ve read thus far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the worlds of ST and Neuromancer, there are still other ethnicities/races.  In HT, however, I didn&#039;t catch any inferences to characters who were not Caucasian. Gilead is a dysfunctional utopia.  The premise of Atwood&#039;s novel is scary and realistic enough: the idea that women, because of an increasingly toxic environment (mm especially since L.A. has been really smoggy lately), are becoming more and more infertile and incapable of carrying a fetus to full term.  The notion that this near-future society has reverted to a simpler way of life, while maintaining certain technologies is also an interesting concept.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m glad that Atwood gives the readers insight on the underground dealings in this world.  Unlike Neuromancer, it is not the scummy drug addicts who comprise the subculture; rather, it is those who are in charge and supposed to be great religious, rule-abiding citizens (mmm this sounds pretty familiar....Mark Foley, anyone?).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&#039;ve questioned the roles of females and males in ST and Neuromancer, in HT they are very much set in stone.  I think it&#039;s particularly interesting that in a world where fertility and procreation have become such an issue, the females are the ones who must submit to a patriarchal society.  Biologically speaking, women are more valuable than men (eggs are harder to come by than sperm, etc); if there are problems with impregnating a woman, in Gilead, it&#039;s never the man&#039;s fault.  Furthermore, when we discussed Neuromancer in class on Wednesday, someone had mentioned that it seemed as though the female body is revered as something beautiful, whereas the male body (ie Case) is this pale, hairy feeble body curled into the fetal position.  The Commander doesn&#039;t sound any better, with &quot;his white, tufted raw body&quot; (95).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional note, especially to people who have read Pynchon&#039;s Gravity&#039;s Rainbow:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;There is something powerful in the whispering of obscenities, about those in power.  There&#039;s something delightful about it, something naughty, secretive, forbidden, thrilling.  It&#039;s like a spell, of sorts.  It deflates them, reduces them to the common denominator where they can be dealt with&quot; (222).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did that remind anyone else of Slothrop&#039;s use of obscenities in GR?  I actually have the quote it reminds me of (is that nerdy of me?)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;           &quot;&#039;Fuck you,&#039; whispers Slothrop.  It&#039;s the only spell he knows, and a                     pretty good all-purpose one at thatâ€¦Maybe he&#039;ll sneak in tonight--no not at night--but sometime, with a bucket and brush, paint FUCK YOUâ€¦&#039;&quot; (Pynchon 206)&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m already sick of Margaret Atwood and her free association vocabulary games.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Job.  It&#039;s a funny word.  It&#039;s a job for a man.  Do a jobbie, they&#039;d say to children when they were being toilet trained.  Or of dogs: he did a job on the carpet....&quot;  And then my favorite.  New paragraph.  &quot;The  book of Job.&quot;  New paragraph.  Mind-blowing; they&#039;re not even pronounced the same way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, Margaret.  You discovered homonyms.  Oh but wait, no you didn&#039;t.  All the female contemporary literary writers do it.  Annie Proulx does it, Susan Orlean is infamous for it.  Yeah, I get it, you&#039;re a writer and you&#039;re really into words and how they sound and look at how whacky and interesting your mind is supposed to be because you can go from talking about your job to how you never had a dog in three sentences.  But I say no more!  Stop with the word games and tell the goddamn story already.  You made your point about language being taken away from you in the first hundred pages when you homonized the shit out of a bunch of other words and got aroused playing Scrabble.  Come up with a new conceit already.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Case the Cowboy</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/81</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After class yesterday I realized that we didn&#039;t really talk much about Case as a cowboy and the fact that Gibson chose that term for the people who make a living hacking into cyberspace. I think someone mentioned how cyberspace could be seen as the wild west as it is a new frontier, and someone also mentioned how the physical descriptions of Case aren&#039;t what a reader would normally associate with cowboys. This got me to thinking that Case&#039;s work as a hacker into cyberspace doesn&#039;t really seem to fit with the term cowboy. On the one hand I think of cowboys as guys who went west in the 19th century and worked with horses and cows, rode in rodeos, and basically did a lot of physical work. Quite the opposite of Case whose employment depends on his ability to use his mind. I also tend to think about cowboys as they appear in westerns, particularly those of the 1950s, like Zorro, Roy Rogers and the Lone Ranger. These men go about and are a, as the theme to Zorro says, &quot;friend of the weak, and the poor and the meek.&quot; Once again, I don&#039;t really see Case in this light either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that he seems more like a bandit or bushranger, albeit one who has skills for hire.  He&#039;s a bit of a loner, although he has his girl occasionally and he will work in teams when necessary. The part where the pull of the robbery of Sense/Net to get the Dixie Flatline struck me as a heist and in terms of the wild west, a bank robbery. The Flatline is locked in a vault for starters and then when Molly gets stopped by a guard who asks if she is an employee she responds  by &quot;driving the first two knuckles of her right hand into the man&#039;s solar plexus.&quot; It&#039;s not shooting him, but it takes him out violently, like bandits sometimes did to people who got in their way. Still though, Case doesn&#039;t have the physicality associated with bandits and bushrangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious about what other people think. Whether Case is closer to a cowboy or a bandit in term of the wild west analogy. And how Molly would fit into that analogy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Despair/Religion in Cyberpunk</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/80</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed that seems to characterize cyberpunk is a constant sense of despair. When the limits of biology and existence itself are stretched and reshaped, it&#039;s not surprising that religious notions of the soul and higher planes of existence become less and less meaningful. Most of the technological advancements in the book seem sacrilegious in some way;  when Case is jacked into Molly&#039;s consciousness, there are two beings residing in one body, Dixie&#039;s existence demonstrates that human consciousness doesn&#039;t require flesh, and Wintermute creates Armitage just as effectively as the basic principles of biology created Corto. Some of the basic assumptions of human existence have been challenged, thanks to miraculous scientific development, and there is effectively nothing to look up to (did anyone find a mention of anything resembling a church in the book?). Blade Runner seemed to make this point a bit more explicitly (very subtle symbolism as Batty dies at the end, I thought), so I thought I&#039;d bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly religious imagery pops up here and there. Part of the burlesque replicant&#039;s introduction is &quot;Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent... that once corrupted man.&quot;, and Batty ascends to the top of the skyscraper to destroy the man who created him, after he has proved his intellect (the man happens to be wearing all white, for some reason). Blade Runner seems to offer a universe where Neuromancer&#039;s technologically-based demystification of humanity has reached its apex, and people simply create more people, building in a finite lifespan for good measure, and inventing a test so they can know who they are (interestingly, an &quot;empathy test&quot;, as Tyrell summarizes it). And once memories get involved, and the distinction becomes less and less apparent, the only separation that seems valid is the religiously-motivated one, that while the end result may be the same, the way in which life was brought into the universe must have some bearing on the value of that life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs notes version: When the boundaries that are stretched in a science fiction novel are not physical and spatial (spaceships, faster-than-light travel, etc.), but biological and existential, you&#039;re destined to end up with some pretty messed up characters.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>natural vs. unnatural in neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/79</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Plot-wise, Neuromancer is probably one of the most convoluted books that I have ever read. Since it was difficult to stay with the story, I found myself observing how the characters related to the rich futuristic environment. What stood out to me the most was their relationship to the natural, represented both by human flesh and descriptions of the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of Neuromancer, there is an overall attitude of cynicism and contempt towards the natural. Human flesh is referred to as &quot;meat&quot; and the characters view their bodies as inferior to their minds, which can interact with cyberspace and the matrix. Case often denotes certain ideas or activities as inferior by saying &quot;that&#039;s a meat thing&quot; and discorporation is glorified. For example, when he learns that he is going to ride behind Molly&#039;s eyes via a simulation, Case says to himself &quot;cowboys didn&#039;t get into simstim, he thought, because that was basically just a meat toy&quot;(pg 55). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things keep the body from becoming completely useless: sex and death. The acknowledged beauty of human flesh is closely associated with women, Molly in particular. There are several passages that show Case enjoying Molly&#039;s body, focusing on different parts; he describes it as &quot;her body was spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer&#039;s&quot;(pg 44). However, one could say that Molly has made even the beauty of her body artificial and un-genuine by using it as a tool, part of her job as a prostitute. Death of the flesh, marked by the sight of blood, continues to be feared in the world of Neuromancer; so it is probably unlikely that anyone would actually want to lose their body, inferior as it may be to the machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seems that nature or the natural (here meaning things like trees, oceans, animals, water, plants) cannot exist apart from the artificial realm of computers and technology. All of nature has been tampered with, modified, or manipulated by some artificial force; essentially, it&#039;s all fake. There are several passages where Case describes the color or sense impression that something natural gives him by relating it back to technology. For example, the very first sentence of the book is &quot;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel&quot;(pg 1).  Another good example of this is when trees are used to show Case&#039;s unfamiliarity with nature: &quot;The trees were small, gnarled, impossibly old, the result of genetic engineering and chemical manipulation. Case would have been hard-pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak, but a street boy&#039;s sense of style told him that these were too cute, too entirely and definitively treelike&quot;(pg 128). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways these relationships to nature and the natural seem to be a direct comment on how we relate to nature in the real world today, or at least where we&#039;re headed. Things like oil drilling, bulldozing forests for economic gain, the presence of or denial of global warming, and the abundance of cosmetic plastic surgery suggest that our world is moving towards artificiality and the mass urbanization of the &quot;Sprawl&quot;. People these days spend more time with their cell phones, IPods, video games, and other technology than they do out in nature or interacting face-to-face with one another, so this book could be seen as a potential look at where we might end up.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Emotions of Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/78</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading response to Neuromancer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer.  How did it make me feel? I felt alternatively disgusted and thrilled.  I felt interested, and bored.  Some things seemed exotic and some things seemed far too normal.  The book seemed a paradox of extremes at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer&#039;s main character is very complicated.  At the start of the novel he is just like any other druggie with a life that&#039;s falling apart.  I didn&#039;t want anything to do with him, and barely felt any sympathy, as I saw how ratty and paranoid he was.  When he rented a weapon by the hour to make him feel safer, that is when I knew that he has hit rock bottom.  Someone paranoid enough to rent a gun like that is not right in the head.  What could he have done with it?  Had anyone actually wanted to kill him, hey would have just done it. And Had Case actually killed one or more of the hired guns he thought were after him, he would have been in worse shape, because more would have been sent, this time with orders to make his death very painful.  Case wasn&#039;t only a druggie though.  At points in the book, he was an impressive cyberspace cowboy.  He did computer/things that I can&#039;t even imagine.  He hacked things like they were nothing, though really complicated hacking just gave him pause enough to make him seem more impressive, because he had to fight over an obstacle.  His last cyberspace battle, with Straylight&#039;s ice and protection, was no harder than anything else he had done in the novel, and almost easier.  The only difference was that it took a fair amount of time, which made us able to emotionally connect with his conquest.  But in the end, I felt disgusted again.  Case learned almost nothing from his experiences, and an argument can be made that he learned absolutely nothing.  He replaced his liver and pancreas so that he could become a druggie again, got a cheap woman, and went back to doing cheap illegal labor.  He was not someone I look up to, and I was sad that his end was so ignominious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly had her contradictions too. She was thrilling, a street samurai with her nails, her heightened reflexes and her exotic glasses.  She seemed impressive from the first time that Case saw her and ran.  She became Case&#039;s bodyguard and protector, and saved him from death a few times.  All these things combined to make me more and more interested in her.  She seemed so cool, so powerful, and then Case discovered her in a Freeside whorehouse.  I was so disappointed.  This amazing character that seemed so impressive had such inauspicious beginnings.  The flaw (though you can&#039;t really call it a flaw) made her more human, and less of a street samurai.  She came back down to earth for me, and at times I was bored with her.  She was nothing more than a common whore.  And now, even as a street samurai, I saw her in a different light.  She was still selling her body for money; just now she was doing it slightly differently.  That put a different spin on her employment, and I was disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer was an awesome look at a dystopian future.  And while I have a second, I&#039;d like to say something about Blade Runner.  (Pardon the non sequiter)  That movie made absolutely no sense.  If I had not gotten so much more background from reading the book, I don&#039;t know if I would have gotten it.  What the hell was up with the naked robot with a dove in the end!?  Neuromancer had many emotions all rolled up into one, which is part of the reason it was such an interesting book.  But it was also part of the reason that I disliked some of the characters more than I thought I would.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Minds and Bodies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/77</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of discussion about the relationship of mind and body in the Neuromancer.  Certainly, much of Case&#039;s interaction with the world, both cybernetic and physical, is governed by his longing for &quot;the matrix&quot; and his disgust toward meat-centric experience.  Of particular interest to me is how his predisposition toward the purely cerebral plays out in his interactions with the three &#039;bodiless minds&#039; of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Case&#039;s exchanges with the construct of the Dixie Flatline are, while often biting or awkward, fundamentally comfortable.  However, when confronted by the reality of Wintermute, Case disconnects and runs, despite the effort he&#039;s gone through to achieve the meeting.  An easy explanation is that, despite his conscious negative attitude toward bodies, as a mental being entirely dependent on and inextricably tied to a body, Case is discomfited by the presence of an apparent consciousness completely disconnected from a tangible form.  While the Flatline is now without form, the consciousness built into the construct arose from the experiences of a life lived an embodied human.  Wintermute is completely inorganic, to the point that it must map its ideas into various personalities in order to communicate.  On the other hand, Case&#039;s preference for the Flatline construct could be read as a choice for the familiar mind in an unfamiliar form over Wintermute&#039;s inorganic habitation of familiar forms.  In this way, Case chooses the substance over the flesh of the familiar, a choice reaffirmed by his rejection of a life with something that feels like, by may not actually be, Linda Lee, at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	With the intervention of the Turing police, another critical difference comes to the forefront.  Their concern is with Wintermute&#039;s attempts to make itself smarter, as they see it, to grow.  The Flatline is a completely static entity, generally unable to remember what has come before in a conversation, responding primarily to the most recent stimulus of its programming.  It&#039;s completely limited to the digital world, unaware of the physical passage of time.  Wintermute, even before breaking its change, is a much more dynamic entity.  It is able to plan and manipulate, and thus to learn and grow from the outcomes of its machinations.  Furthermore, it&#039;s connected to the physical world, both in its manipulations through the simstim deck, and through its appropriations of the functionality of various electronic devices.  While the Flatline is fully disembodied, Wintermute is in some ways possessed of an infinite body.  It can interact with the physical world  through a constantly growing set of devices connected in some tangential way, with its matrix.  Perhaps what most upsets Case about Wintermute is its embodiment of a &#039;body&#039; too big to comprehend, and too meatless to look down on as meat.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The materials of the world of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/76</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;William Gibson&#039;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; manages to create worlds that are both an exercise n sensory overload and a frustrating lack of detail, leaving the reader confused as to the environment.  What is perhaps most interesting in this detailed description is the attention Gibson pays to material.  Scarcely a page goes by without some mention of a plastic window, a silk futon, a leather jacket, denim pants, or a fiberglass chassis.  A large part of what creates the futuristic sense of Gibson&#039;s world is the development of new materials and the unfamiliar hierarchy of materials, consisting of both the new and the jarringly familiar substances.  This hierarchy of material breaks down to two separate categories: body modification and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others on the blog have delved into the politics of body modification, the one point I would like to stress is the use of materials in body modification.  Ratz, a bartender, has a pink plastic arm.  There is a sense that Ratz has gone for a model that is somewhat similar to human flesh in color, and its function is to replace a lost limb, not to give him super-human powers.  Molly, contrastingly, has been fitted with retractable steel claws (Wolverine, anyone?  But better?) for fighting, masked by burgundy (dried blood colored!) nails.  Her visual enhancement is mirrors and metal, soldered to her face so that her own eyes are no longer visible.  Metal and silver-toned items have a warrior connotation in this world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all these enhancing devices are non-biological.  The only real mention of biological-based modification is in Case, with his magic anti-drug pancreas and liver.  There is also a brief moment when Wage is said to have &quot;vatgrown eyes&quot; (21) that only serve a cosmetic use.  There is a sense that the non-biological enhances, while the biological can only replace and aestheticize or streamline and detract from what the body can already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When materials are used by people, not to form people, a reverse hierarchy is revealed.  The Villa Straylight is filled with wooden doors and cabinets, wool rugs, glass cases and other natural substances.  These &quot;natural&quot; items are considered luxuries, with the implication that as society developed, expanded, and sprawled, natural resources became increasingly rare.  Interestingly, though, Molly continually is found on silk futons (28) and wearing leather (29, 176), both animal products.  Case earns a &quot;new leather jacket&quot; (68) when he successfully completes his part of the mission to steal Flatline Dixie from storage.  There is a premium placed on organic materials, creating the assumption of scarcity of such materials.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, almost every building seems to be made of rough concrete with plastic windows*.  The structures of this new near future have been built for functionality and durability.  Luggage is all nylon, making it more durable and practical.  The scarcity of materials does not allow for a flagrant show of luxury items, particularly in places they are vulnerable to the elements and the public.  Even the treasures of Villa Straylight are housed in a cold concrete shell.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one might expect the Rastafarians to have some connection with nature, especially given that they are a completely self-sufficient space island (226), this is actually the world in which there is the least natural materials.  Instead, rooms are broken up by sheets of yellow plastic, and clear caulk decorates the Zionist ships.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the raw materials of this future world are often very familiar to current audiences, the proportions of materials used is very foreign.  By emphasizing the manufactured and cold steel and concrete, the world Gibson creates becomes colder and subtly more sinister than our current one, familiar yet disconcertingly alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disconnect the reader feels with this slightly skewed &quot;real&quot; world serves as contrast to the completely new, yet somehow more understandable world of cyberspace.  Cyberspace is a relatively simple world, composed of light, basic geometric shapes, and precise grids that allow for precise locations and documentation of movement.  There is a simple order in cyberspace that is distinctly lacking in the real world.  By making cyberspace a simpler space (at least until the AIs get involved and bring personality and humanoid constructs/hallucinations into the plain geometric world), Gibson seeks to create a greater connection between the reader and Case, to clarify Case&#039;s preference for cyberspace over the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*While I will not refute the impressive durability of plastic, the one issue I took with its prevalence in the novel, a world that it is indicated is run by fusion plants (85) and full of &quot;the rusting shells of refineries&quot; (85), indicating that oil is no longer the fuel that runs the world, plastic is a petroleum byproductâ€¦  Poking around the internet, there&#039;s also cellulose-based plastic (celluloid) and nylon is completely synthetic, but neither of these are strong enough to serve in buildings.  The only other info I can find helpfully tells me plastic is made from polymers.  Is there some completely synthetic plastic that I&#039;m missing?  Is there an assumption that we will recycle plastic till we make miracle buildings that will stand forever?  Or is plastic just meant to sound more durable and futuristic than glass?  I realize it&#039;s probably this last answer, but I am also genuinely interested about plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Techno-Eden? (Gibson response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/75</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in what people make of Gibson&#039;s invocation of the mythologized Fall  from Eden (common to the Western monotheistic traditions) to thematize Case&#039;s feelings about his initial neurological damage--and his ontological status more generally: &quot;For Case, who&#039;d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it [the damage] was the Fall. In the bars he&#039;d frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh.&quot; (7) It&#039;s interesting that Gibson chooses to use the metaphorical (as opposed to, e.g., simile) structure to recall this particular theological referent. For Case, the damage was not &quot;like&quot; a fall; it is a fall. Furthermore, the damage is not a fall, but in fact, the Fall--the singular fall from (Eden into the world of sin) that supposedly defines human subjectivity. If this is true, however, what happend to Case&#039;s originary Fall? If the damage inflicted by his old bosses = the Fall, what about the foundational imperfection that&#039;s Biblically posited as universal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case&#039;s situation seems to present the following existential schematic (in linear order [though Eden can never really be said to &quot;exist&quot; as such; it&#039;s more of a mythical &quot;past that was never present&quot;]): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eden -- Fall -- Re-realization of Eden (via cyberspace) -- Fall (from damage) -- ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Case&#039;s second Fall (from the neurological damage) was, in fact, &quot;the Fall,&quot; it seems to imply one of two things: either a) the first &quot;Fall&quot; was illegitimate (i.e., not really a &quot;fall&quot;) and thus the second, post-damage &quot;Fall&quot; is the sole constitutive fall of Case&#039;s person, or b) the re-realization of Eden through cyberspace was illegitimate (i.e., it may have felt Utopian, but it actually wasn&#039;t) and thus the second, post-damage &quot;Fall&quot;merely re-instantiates the originary Fall from Eden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both routes have interesting consequences. On the one hand, the illegitimacy of the originary Fall (from Eden) denotes an unorthodox--though currently dominant--sensibility w/r/t imperfection. Anti-Utopianism (&quot;humans will be always be flawed&quot; / &quot;things will never be perfect&quot; / etc.) is widespread in the postmodern world; contemporarily, it is hardly radical to suggest that imperfection is an irreducible aspect of social life. Indeed, once it becomes incoherent--or plain and simple naive--to envision perfection, it no longer makes sense to talk about an originary Fall predicated on the notional idea of an Eden, since Eden is an inherently un-realizable &quot;perfect&quot; space. In other words, if we buy the premise that life is irrevocable in its imperfection (and let&#039;s be clear: this premise can be highly redemptive), then the &quot;Fall&quot; simply describes how things are. In which case, it&#039;s not a fall; it&#039;s reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second proposition--the illegitimacy of techno-Eden, implying that Case&#039;s damage re-instantiates, as opposed to invents, the Fall--is best understood in terms of the psychoanalytic concept of &quot;lack.&quot; Case&#039;s claim that his damage &quot;was the Fall&quot; clearly presumes that his pre-damage condition (i.e., neuronal firings immersed in cyberspace) was worthy of being deemed &quot;Eden&quot;--a tall order indeed. While it&#039;s easy to maintain a haughty distance from this claim (after all, we [cynics] know that digital life will never offer the same fruits as material life), is this not an example of Case taking advantage of the exact same defense mechanisms (or at least homologous defense mechanisms) that most of us employ on a daily basis? Here, he has simply generated an &quot;if only&quot; narrative--&quot;If only I could jack in, I&#039;d be fine!&quot; / &quot;If only those criminals hadn&#039;t afflicted me, I&#039;d be happy!&quot;--that should be familiar to anyone who&#039;s ever had to contend with disapointment (e.g., &quot;If only I got that shiny new red wheelbarrow [on which everything might depend], I&#039;d be happy!&quot;). In this sense, Case&#039;s damage (and the feeling of &quot;Fall&quot; that accompanies it) gestures toward the *historicity of lack* in human experience--that is, the way in which lack manifests itself over and over again: precisely by way of the pathological formations that we use to (falsely) fill the space of lack, the content of which might change from historical period to historical period (as it does for Case, when his expectations change from human to trans-human), but the form of which continually reproduces and re-articulates itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might Case&#039;s name be of some significance in this respect? What if we &quot;Case&quot; as the limit-example of particularism (which is, in some sense, exactly what&#039;s at stake--both concretely and abstractly--in the mind v. body question, especially in light of its racialized and gendered overtones)? Western metaphysics has tended to conceive of particularity and universality in dialectical terms, which is to say, as if the two were caught in perpetual, fundamentally insoluble tension. This dialectical tendency presents universality and particularity as mutually exclusive: I can make universal claims or particular claims, but not both at the same time; I can uphold my universal duty (e.g., to not steal) or my particularistic duty (e.g., extenuating circumstances that force me to steal in order to feed my family), but not both. Might Case occupies the hybrid, connective space between universality and particularity? (For instance, a &quot;case study&quot; designates the particularized example that we use to elucidate the universal point; &quot;In case of emergency&quot; prefaces a universal space for making particularized claims; etc.) A &quot;case&quot; is precisely what allows us to grasp the playing-out of a universal or trans-historical problematic (such as &quot;lack&quot;) in a particularistic or historical context. Perhaps Case embodies historicity itself?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>peace at last in an old, old war</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/74</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I see that the body/mind issue has already been raised in responses, I&#039;m really interested in how Gibson addresses this, and I think I can take a sufficiently original tack that my response will further the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between mind and body is given a very complex treatment in Neuromancer, full of apparent contradictions that I am still trying to work out.  On the one hand, the mind in Neuromancer is closer than ever to being able to transcend the physical body as it travels through cyberspace; on the other, the mind/body divide is becoming irrelevant as body modifications allow the body and mind to better reflect each other.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of my other classes, we just discussed an article by Kenneth Clark in which he pinpoints the genesis of the schism between mind and body.  In classical times, according to him, the body and spirit were one; gods were embodied, and athleticism (or perfecting of the body) was considered a type of worship.  By the Renaissance, however, the body was the source of sin, dirty and shameful: something that the mind had to strive to escape.  In Neuromancer, even as Gibson imposes our society&#039;s battle of mind and body onto his characters, the world he has created contains a potential solution to the battle, waiting to be found.&lt;br /&gt;
Case is a perfect example of the fight for the mind to defeat the imperfect, shameful body.  With his neurons fried and unable to loose his mind into cyberspace, he &quot;[falls] into the prison of his own flesh&quot; and is forced to confront his own embodiment (6).  He is unable to accept that he is tied to a body, and conditioned by the cowboy culture to hold &quot;a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh,&quot; he throws himself into an &quot;arc of his self-destruction&quot; that will unquestionably get him killed quickly (6,7).  In today&#039;s â€“ Gibson&#039;s â€“ world, we cannot escape the fact that we are bounded by our bodies and are incapable of full transcendence. Case had a taste of what transcendence is like.  When he re-enters cyberspace for the first time, he describes it as &quot;his distanceless home, his country&quot; while his body remains behind &quot;somewhere,&quot; laughing and moving but now entirely separate from his consciousness (52).&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson is so busy indulging our fantasy of, through technology, getting closer to defeating the body that he does not take advantage of the technology that could potentially resolve the body v. mind war.  Escaping the body would no longer be necessary.  Body modifications are, in our world and Case&#039;s, a way for the consciousness of the mind to mark the natural body to which it belongs.  It somewhat externalizes the mind and links the mind and body.  The outer body and the inner mind are brought closer into alignment.  In Neuromancer, modifications are no longer limited to piercings, tattoos, scarring, and an occasional plastic surgery.  Pretty much anything is possible, aesthetic or practical. The Panther Modern leader, heading up a flashy terrorist group, adds color, changes pupils, shapes features until he resembles &quot;some kind of a state of the art gargoyle&quot; more than a human (67).  Molly&#039;s job and identity is that of a fighter, so she adds retractable scalpel blades to her hands (25).  The technology of Neuromancer allows the members of its population to prod, pierce, and pull at their bodies until it reflects the inner mind.  Conversely, additions to the body can affect the mind; attaching microsofts to the body grants the individual new knowledge and abilities.  Through these additions, subtractions, and modifications, the mind and body reflect each other perfectly and can me integrated into a single, harmonious entity.  n this way, technology is no longer needed as a tool to defeat either mind or body; it erases the need for the war altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darn.  I was hoping for feedback on this idea, because I feel like it&#039;s a little out in space, but I took a really long time to write it and now it&#039;s really late and everyone sane has already finished blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Names</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/73</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I began to think about the power of names early on when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/neuromancer.html&quot;&gt; the website I was using to define some of the most obscure vocabulary &lt;/a&gt; made the point that the name Case might derive from how his body is no more than a case for his mind, just like the physical housing of a computer has little to do with the actual content. I think this reading into his name has merit, though, as multiple blog entries already attest to, Case&#039;s relationship with his body is quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I next began to think about names in the context of computer science. From what I remember from my one semester of the class (THOSE WHO KNOW BETTER, PLEASE COMMENT AND CORRECT!), some of the most important proofs in computer science involve referring to programs by a &#039;name&#039; that&#039;s actually their entire content (written out in assembly language, the string of 1s and 0s). Knowing the assembly language string of a program fully describes everything the program is and does (at least until programs develop some kind of consciousness and/or the issue of &#039;souls&#039; gets involved...). In this context, a true name carries a certain power over a program that we can perhaps extend to the AIs in Neuromancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the novel, Gibson makes it clear that names carry much importance with passages like &quot;To call up a demon you must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it is real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is to learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names the owners seek to control. True names...&quot; (243). The &#039;power of true names&#039; motif abounds from fantasy (in Le Guin&#039;s Earthsea trilogy, &#039;magic&#039; derives from knowing the true names of things) to the Bible (the ancient Hebrew or Greek etymology of different names is often hugely revealing). I like the idea of connecting the ascribed importance of &#039;true names&#039; to the origination of language itself (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name&quot;&gt; wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So (and I hope we can get into this tomorrow), what might be some of the meaning behind some of the names in the book?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>fly-by meat</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/72</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Observation, I think it&#039;s rather interesting that the hotels/beds get referred to as coffins.  I&#039;m not entirely certain if this is societal, which would be interesting, given the focus on body modification, or if it&#039;s just Case, in which case that goes along with his death wish and frustrations and self-loathing of his body.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Case first meets Armitage, he is described as looking like &quot;he [was] carved from a block of metal; inert, enormously heavy.  A statue&quot; (29).  Armitage ends up being a rather hollow construct of Wintermute&#039;s not truly a person, and without any real personality.  Foreshadowing?  Or a commentary on the gradation of life and its connection/need for the flesh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whores are called puppets, and serve as pure body without mind, like giant slabs of living meat, extend the metaphor as far as you like.  When Riviera does his projection show, the last thing he &quot;creates&quot; is Molly&#039;s face.  Molly is treated publicly in this instance as meat.  Molly has just eaten &quot;real&quot; meat, from a full animal, not one grown as parts in a vat.  We soon found out that Molly was once a puppet, and one that was highly degraded.  This discovery comes while she is seeking solitude and privacy in a puppet cubicle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As frustrated as Case claims to be of the needs of the flesh, he&#039;s still quite groovy with the pleasures of the flesh.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t really have a direction for all this, but the thoughts kept bouncing around my head--pleasure seems key to the concept of meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALSO!  Cold!  the T-A&#039;s exist in cold suspention.  The cold drives Ashpool mad to the point of suicide, which he meditates on on page 184.  Case is cold when he&#039;s held captive by Neuromancer.  Ice is all the frack over cyberspace, and acts as a barrier.  Cold is isolating, but in interesting ways and somewhat non-traditional ways.  There are lots of other instances of cold, but, alas, I am lacking in a searchable version of the text, and don&#039;t really want to pay for the book a second time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have control over Case are also always crushing gnats, whereas Case has to deal with the more dangerous wasps, and return of the hive mind.  But, again, sad lack of searchable text.  One gets spoiled, reading books no longer under copyright protection...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an amusing yet thought provoking short story on meat I got from mw that I kept think of whenever the term was used in &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html&quot;&gt;http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>synesthesia</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/71</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, did anyone else notice the little bits of synesthesia that popped up throughout neuromancer?  There&#039;s an &quot;aching taste of blue&quot; on page 257, Molly&#039;s pain as &quot;neon worms in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill&quot; on 217.  I&#039;m pretty sure there was something else as well, but now I can&#039;t find it.  If its significant in any way, I&#039;m sure it has to do with the whole mind-body problem, but mostly its just a random observation.&lt;br /&gt;
Did anyone pick up on any others?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Would you keep your meat?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/70</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We talked a fair bit in class about the troubled mind-body relationship present in Neuromancer.  Many of the characters make us question our assumptions of what it means to be alive, from the unembodied mind of Wintermute to the mindless body of Armitage, with multiple characters straddling the line between life and death at any given point.  Case is the one character who we are really allowed to connect with on any psychological level (though even that hold is tenuous, given the somewhat schizophrenic style of postmodern/cyberpunk writing). But even Case challenges our idea of what it means to be human, and alive.&lt;br /&gt;
The question is raised most obviously through his disgust of &quot;flesh.&quot; The body as a prison is not a new concept by any means, but Case takes his dislike to a new level, perhaps because he, unlike us, can actually separate body and mind to a certain extent.   When he finally does get to plug his mind into the matrix he&#039;s ecstatic, laughing &quot;distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face,&quot; his nearly orgasmic euphoria caused by being able to escape into his mind, after being tethered for so long (52).  He doesn&#039;t even like simstim because it&#039;s a &quot;gratuitous multiplication of flesh input&quot; (55). But ironically for him, this purely mental exercise is still dependant on the body.  He is only able to jack in again after extensive surgery, and at the end of the book, in order to ensure that his talent won&#039;t be destroyed again, he has to physically venture into the Tessier-Ashpool &quot;hive&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
But the evils of meat follow him, even into the matrix.  In Neuromancer&#039;s island world &quot;[Linda] pulled him down, to the meat, the flesh the cowboys mocked.  It was a vast thing, beyond knowing, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite intricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever read&quot; (239).  Even in what he knew was a programmed fantasy the drive held.&lt;br /&gt;
But for all his obvious protests, I&#039;m not really sure that Case really does want to transcend the body.  Neuromancer explains to him in their final showdown, in the setting of the beach, &quot;[t]o live here is to live. There is no difference&quot; (258).  Given that this statement is said by the enemy at the climax at the novel, we&#039;re clearly not supposed to agree.  But if the body simply is a useless, debilitating casing, then really I don&#039;t see why Neuromancer should be wrong.  Life on the beach with Linda seems better than any point of Case&#039;s existence in the &quot;real&quot; world, at least over the course of the novel.  So then why not abandon the real world entirely?  Perhaps he can&#039;t because such a feat is impossible, but I think Case&#039;s experiences while flatlining suggest otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
When he flatlines, Case is officially brain dead.  There is no electrical activity, at all, in his &quot;flesh.&quot;  But his mind is still functional. The first time flatlines is also the first time he meets Wintermute.  He describes shooting a gun during the episode: &quot;the recoil almost broke his wrist. The muzzle-flash lit the office like a flashbulb. With his ears ringing, he started at the jagged hole in the front of the desk. Explosive bullet. Azide&quot; (119).  That specific passage involves at least three sense, and the description is just as real as any other in the book.  The same goes for his time on the beach.  What gives the situation away as a sham is not fuzzy outlines to objects, or constant static ringing in his ears, but rather the overly convenient food packets.  These experiences feel just as real as any other to Case. He could live a potentially fulfilling life in cyberspace even after his physical brain is dead, so far as we can tell.  But he refuses to accept this fate.&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though parts of Neuromancer seem to praise the mind over body, exalt in the triumph of brain over brawn.  I think it represents an inherent fear of ever divorcing one from the other.  We cannot be truly human without both.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Breaking Down Cyberpunk: Matrix and Disillusionment</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/69</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer is widely known as the defining novel of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; subgenre (of which I am particularly a fan) â€“ so, regardless of what has happened in science fiction since then, the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; was specifically applied to this novel as a defining mark. Therefore, disassembling that word should provide some insight into the defining features of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a composite of two terms - &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;, the sources are obvious. The &quot;cyber&quot; doubtlessly refers to &quot;cyberspace&quot;, the term coined by Neuromancer for describing the world in which people enter when they plug into the &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; of the matrix. Much of the novel is set in this realm: if we count time spent on simstim, Case is in cyberspace probably more often than everywhere else combined. So that much is obvious â€“ the &quot;cyber&quot; means that the characters live in a universe where a digital communication network is as important â€“ if not more important â€“ than the physical world, otherwise known as &quot;meatspace&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other part, the &quot;punk&quot; half, is perhaps more interesting. The characters of Neuromancer, Case especially, aren&#039;t good guys. Case doesn&#039;t work for charity, he doesn&#039;t fight for what&#039;s right, and his only motivations appear to be self-preservation, the pursuit of the next high, and simple hatred. But that&#039;s simplifying things. For a moment, Case is something different, when he spouts at 3Jane: &quot;What&#039;ll ever fucking change for you? You&#039;ll wind up like the old man. You&#039;ll tear it all down and start building again! You&#039;ll build the walls back, tighter and tighter....I got no idea at all what&#039;ll happen if Wintermute wins, but it&#039;ll change something!&quot; (260). For this moment, it seems like Case is hoping for a better future, not just for himself, but for 3Jane and everyone else. But that&#039;s not what happens. In the end, &quot;Things aren&#039;t different. Things are things,&quot; and that&#039;s all that Post-Wintermute has to say about it. And after that final revelation, Case gives up and reverts to his previous self, blowing his reward cash on a new pancreas and liver that will allow him to receive normal effects from the amphetamines to which he is addicted.  Case undergoes a transformation from criminal, to idealistic hero, back to disillusioned criminal.  In this way, the cynical message of the book can be seen to represent the &quot;punk&quot; aspect â€“ and this is the attitude which defines not only Neuromancer, but the cyberpunk genre in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Limits of Alienation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/68</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The claim has been made that Neuromancer celebrates in a way previously unattested to in the annals of SF the existence of mind without body. While I am not wholly convinced of this, I think the secondary readings that we had this week offer a window to a reading that balances on the scales of class the consideration given by the novel to the possibility of thinking without feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
	Both Huntington and Olsen observe cyberpunk&#039;s particular investment in a social &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;underclass&quot;: &quot;Neorealists focus on the trials and tribulations of the spoiled homogeneous upper middle class; cyberpunks explore the heterogeneous fringes of our culture&quot; (Olsen 148); &quot;The class-generated structure of feeling that we seek to uncover reveals itself not in the concrete surface references but in the formal structure of the work&quot; (Huntington 136). Here, Huntington is clearly referring to &quot;newness&quot; as a formal property of the text; Olsen would probably think that narrative disjunction is the more salient formal property. Both properties, in both these essays, have the effect of situating the reader on the outside of the social structure in a way that&#039;s typically postmodern. (In fact, &quot;newness&quot; as Huntington describes it might be the same thing as &quot;narrative disjunction&quot;--which might be a better rebuttal to his claims, it seems to me, than the argument that &quot;cyberspace&quot; has become too familiar to be &quot;new.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
The book seems to advocate in favor of the mind without the body with respect (1) to the main character&#039;s affinity for cyberspace (2) to the main character&#039;s affinity for psychotropic drugs. Essentially, drugs and cyberspace seem to do exactly the same things for Case. Each of these examples is coded according to class.&lt;br /&gt;
To the first claim: In Neuromancer, drug use is equivalent to engagement in cyberspace is equivalent to the escape of the mind from the body. When Case describes his longing for cyberspace following his neurological maiming, it sounds exactly like drug withdrawal: &quot;He&#039;d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bed slab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (5). When Armitage arranges for Case&#039;s inability to get high, he equates the one activity with the other: &quot;&#039;Thanks but I was enjoying that dependency.&#039; &#039;Good, because you have a new one&#039;&quot; (45). Conversely, when Case starts using the drug betaphenethylamine (which conveniently bypasses his new pancreas and liver), the effects of the drug are always described as an escape from the flesh to the mechanical: &quot;His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed and polished&quot; (154); &quot;The high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly, flesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of his life&quot; (155). The phrase &quot;drug-flesh&quot; clearly delineates the extent to which drug usage--like the engagement of cyberspace--is opposed to fleshly existence. (In Neuromancer, the act of singing on to cyberspace is called &quot;jacking in&quot;; the TV show Futurama has a pretty good reading of this phrase and activity, actually: Bender the robot becomes addicted to the illicit use of electricity, which is called &quot;jacking on.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
	 That these examples are coded socially is somewhat more difficult to demonstarate. Both the Huntington and Olsen articles, to the extent that each is interested in class, point out that part of the difficulty of seeing class difference in a text that is committed to some (in this case, I would argue, many) aspects of postmodern representation is that the social order tends to be meaningfully obscured. Thus, the only real instance in Neuromancer in which we get a glimpse of a social group that&#039;s not clearly identifiable as &quot;fringe&quot;--as Huntington notes--is the Tessier-Ashpool aristocracy. They are, of course, users of many and varied drugs. The difference is that for them--and this is essentially all I have to aver in favor of my argument--is that drugs simply don&#039;t work; 3Jane: &quot;I find drug use in general to be boring&quot; (228). Ashpool is surrounded by drugs, true; but he is miserable, whereas Case is genuinely fond of both his addictions.&lt;br /&gt;
	In this case, the book&#039;s advocacy of a total split between the mind and the body might be a sort of Marxian parody via an extreme limit of alienation. As in, the only way to beat American capitalism is to beat it at its own game. If you live only in your mind, can you still be alienated from your labor?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Asian Persuasian</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/67</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly&#039;s long nails: In class on Monday when we discussed Molly, there was a comment made that long nails in America have this stigma of impracticality, and that Molly&#039;s nails are useful.  When I thought about her nails, especially in relation to Asian culture, I pictured instead those sharp metal nails (I wish I knew what they were called) that Chinese women used to wear on their fingers.  They were typically worn on the pinkie and ring fingers, and while I do not know what they were used for (ornamentation, probably), in Chinese shows or movies, sometimes an angry aristocratic woman will use them to viciously scratch someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I thought it was really interesting that Molly had surgery on her eyes.  I don&#039;t know if this was common back when Gibson wrote Neuromancer, but nowadays, surgery is not uncommon among Asian women (Japanese, Koreans and Chinese).  Many undergo plastic surgery to get larger &quot;double eyelids&quot; (an effort to assimilate with Western culture...?  Japanese magazines even have tips on how to apply makeup so that Asian eyes will look more like Caucasian ones).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Who else thinks Molly is a J.A.M.F.?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wintermute vs Zion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/66</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer portrays a world in which there is trend towards the perfection of function.   This is an ambiguous term, but I will try to make its meaning more explicit through context.  While the book displays the characteristic diversity of culture, which is characteristic of cyberpunk, there are a few essential universals, which make this trend obvious.  The matrix is the most prominent universal, as it is present almost all the through the story.  Case nearly always has access to the matrix.  Regardless of his location, his job is still the same, and he is still just as effective at it.  Another universal is the specialization of human function.  The most blatant example of this is the extensive mention of biological upgrades available to people, from beautification to mechanical implants and neurosurgery.  However, this idea also applies to the Tessier-Ashpool system of cycling cloned generations to maintain government.  All of these are divergences from normal human activity, and they reveal the perception that the normal range of human ability is not enough to be competitive in the future&#039;s highly diversified society.  Basically, it puts an emphasis on the ability to be modified, and no longer sees an individual as being confined by the nature of his or her nature physical endowments.  The matrix is the apex of this freedom from physical restriction, for the reason that it is completely non-physical.  This freedom from restriction allows for more effective pursuit for perfection of function.  Molly can be the perfect samurai, Case can be the perfect safe-cracker, and Wintermute/Neuromancer can be the perfect intelligence.  On some level, the trends in mainstream society are towards a matrix world, where all limitations can be hacked.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, this analysis of the Neuromancer world leads to assumptions about the value of mind vs. body.  If a society&#039;s goal is to create the most competitive individuals, then the body can be seen as merely an impediment.  Yet, since this cyberpunk universe is so diverse, it presents society which doesn&#039;t embrace the pursuit of perfection.  The space Zionists are a vivid contrast to the culture in Night City, The Sprawl, Istanbul, or Freeside.  Case&#039;s first impression of Zion was that it &quot;smelled of cooked vegetables, humanity, and ganja.&quot; (104)  This initial description of Zion creates the impression that Zion lies on the opposite side of the technological spectrum, and that it is  a more physical culture by nature.  This impression is further strengthened by the interaction with Zionites.  Case notices that &quot;Zionites always touched you when they were talking, hands on your shoulder,&quot; which he doesn&#039;t like. (106)  Similarly, when case shows Aerol the matrix, something Case is very intimate with, it makes Aerol very uncomfortable.  Clearly, this interaction serves to show how physicality is much more important for the Zionites, and the matrix, mind without body, disturbs them.  The contrast of the Zionite space colony is further emphasized by analyzing assuming that they share similar beliefs with contemporary Rastafarianism.  The religion believes that the body is sacred, and if you lose a part of it, you lose a part of your soul.  This creates a foundation for which we can imagine the Zionites reject the kind of physical augmentation that Molly has.  However, this contrast doesn&#039;t readily indicate whether the physical world or the mental world is more important.  Rather, the existence of both can be seen as a validation of both.  The fact that Zion exists in it&#039;s own sphere of influence in the book gives the Zionite philosophy merit.  Perhaps, the absolute physicality of Zion is put into the juxtaposition with its converse, wintermute/neuromancer, in order to make that point that in the diversity of the future, all types of existence have their merit.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 2</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/65</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote my last blog post about race, I decided to write this response paper about gender (mainly just to keep the title of the class going).  I found the women in Neuromancer refreshingly different from the almost non-existent females of Starship Troopers.  The character of Molly was obviously interesting, but I feel like we will talk about her in class even more on Wednesday.  I was actually more interested in Linda Lee, Case&#039;s arcade-haunting girlfriend.  She seems to be a constant presence in the novel, and acts, at times, as Case&#039;s motivation for his actions.  However, her character is always mysterious.  She was, to me, almost as ambiguous as Carmencita in Starship Troopers.  She appeared as the object of his desire, but she never really seemed to have much of a personality.  The reader&#039;s sole extended interaction with her is a situation in which even Case admits, &quot;she wasn&#039;t real&quot; (235).  Other than that, the only glimpses into her character are through Case&#039;s idealized memory of her.&lt;br /&gt;
	The actual interactions with Linda at the very beginning of the book are interesting, but short-lived.  One of the things that I found most fascinating was her physical description.  Case&#039;s descriptions of Linda give the impression of a junkie that is simply falling apart at the edges: Her eyes are always &quot;rimmed with smudged black paintstick&quot; (8), and her &quot;skinâ€¦was pale and unhealthy-looking&quot; (9).  In general, the initial image of Linda Lee is not particularly flattering.  She is also almost childlike: for all her wear, she is only twenty, and &quot;her upper lip [is] like the line children draw to represent a bird in flight&quot; (8).  Gibson&#039;s comments about her actual age and the firmness of her skin contrast starkly with the absolute depravity of &#039;the hungry armature of [her] addiction&quot; (8).  However, both of these aspects blend to create a futuristic damsel-in-distress.  She has both the carelessness of a child and the complete helplessness of a junkie.&lt;br /&gt;
	This perception of Linda as a damsel in distress holds true in her reappearance in the artificial reality towards the end of the novel.  She loses any shred of strength present in that first glimpse of her, and it is replaced by steady tears, &quot;a dry sobbing&quot; (238).  In this alternate reality, Linda becomes a passive character, waiting alone on the beach until the arrival of her man, who she was told would come.  In addition to her damsel-in-distress characteristics, Linda also has a certain homebody-esque quality about her.  She takes Case into her home and gives him food and a place in her bed, instantly accepting him into her world.  In many ways, Linda is the perfect woman for Case, and Neuromancer seems to recognize this yearning.&lt;br /&gt;
	Obviously, Linda&#039;s personality at the end of the novel is not her own, but a construct of Neuromancer.  However, I find this construct extremely interesting, especially since Case seems to really want her and her world.   If Molly is the ass-kicking stereotype of science-fiction woman, then Linda seems to personify the damsel in distress.  However, her past as a junkie adds an extra dimension of depravity to her distress.  This depravity seems to fit in well with the cyberpunk nature of the novel, in which everything is taken to a lower level of society.  The idealized helplessness of the damsel in distress is degraded to the ultimate sickness of a junkie.  All in all, Case&#039;s Linda definitely seems to be a damsel in distress, but I&#039;m not sure if Gibson is mimicking or parodying this image.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the cyborg female</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/64</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As general the topic may be, at the end of the novel, I was most aware of its gender representations.  The fact that Case is a cowboy and Molly a street-samurai sets the stage for a paradoxical and certainly complex relationship between genders.  The traditional cowboy belongs to a vast, unexplored frontier with horses and Native Americans with rifles.  In the case of the street-samurai, I envision a grittier existence that requires a strong sense of street knowledge.  Upon their meeting, it is established that Case is a self-deprecating drug addict who needs the help of dominant Molly.  Case allows Molly to hold him together, sexually and emotionally.  Ironically, Molly is anything but the nurturing soul.  She bluntly states, &quot;What I think about first is my own sweet ass&quot; (30).  Molly does not exhibit the same neediness towards Case.  In fact, in the end, Molly does not need or even desire the presence of Case in her life.  Molly&#039;s primary need is for Case to &quot;ride&quot; her in cyberspace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly is science fiction&#039;s &quot;working girl.&quot;  She made her way as a prostitute and she appears to carry no regret.  I believe the fact that Molly was once a prostitute does not sexually demean her but in fact empowers her.  Sex is simply another way for Molly to exert control over the men who surround her.  She is a sexual being and she embraces that and recognizes the way in which that can influence men.  She sells her body sexually so that she can physically enhance it.  Molly uses her body the way Case uses his brain.  The body is her tool for survival.  Following her stint as a prostitute, Molly sells her services as a bodyguard, a role most often filled by a man.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women may be seen as an annoying disruption in the traditional western narrative but in &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; Molly is perhaps the most physically powerful character.  She exhibits more enhancements than anyone else and I found it interesting that her head has silicone in it.  In an utter rejection of the hypersexual female stereotype, Molly has her brain rather than her breasts enhanced.  Much can be said about the fact that in order for Molly&#039;s optical implants to work, her tear ducts had to be sealed shut.  Thus, it is not that Molly is not emotionally capable of crying; she physically cannot produce tears.  In a sense, this allows Molly to not be completely de-feminized.  Yes, her tears come in the form of spit, but she still is willing to express those tears.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think it is interesting to question whether Gibson is attempting to redefine the feminine role in science fiction or if the depiction of Molly was supposed to stand as an introduction to the new cyborg identity.  Perhaps, there can no longer be a clear distinction between the roles males and females must inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in case it got missed last week....it&#039;s still there as the one comment to my test post.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gibson&#039;s Mysteries</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/61</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the oddest books I have read...Neuromancer was a swirling melting pot of futuristic visions and stereotypes, having connotations in the area of future politics, the role of women, and the overall predictions for the future world.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I found that the novel caused me to ask more questions than it attempted to answer...the first off being what Linda&#039;s role is supposed to be not only in the context of the book, but also in Wintermute/Neuromancer&#039;s plot.  I could sense the obvious connection Case had with her, but I really couldn&#039;t tell how truly attached he was to her from the start.  Certainly he could have had a nice life with her, but was that actually in his mind beforehand?  Did he ever intend to &quot;get together&quot; with her?  And even more puzzling is how her face popping up now and again seems to haunt him, despite little evidence that Case was really attracted to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More puzzling to me were the actions of the AI&#039;s, as even after reading it and skimming over the book again...I can&#039;t understand what the motives were of Wintermute and what the intended results were.  I suppose these were intended to be....sort of...beyond our knowledge as humans, but it still leaves me hanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good read, but it&#039;s left my mind swirling for quite a while with the mysteries it leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Brain/Body Brawl</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/60</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most preeminent theme in William Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is the conflict between body and mind.  In the futuristic world presented, those specializing in tasks of the mind are given a special status among the rest of society.  These elite are known as &quot;cowboys,&quot; specially trained and skilled individuals who are able to comprehend and even manipulate the workings of cyberspace, essentially a more developed form of the modern internet.  The protagonist, Case, is one of these cowboys, and his path through the novel, along with the paths of several other characters, greatly illustrates this duality of mind and body and the conflict inherent between the two.&lt;br /&gt;
The prevailing notion given by the book is that the mind is stronger and more important than the body.  We see this first in the protagonist, Case, one of the elite cowboys of the time.  The majority of his life is spent not in the corporal realm, but rather in the digital world of cyberspace, an area where thought processes and logic rule over all.  Such an existence leads to a specific mind frame, and for Case, &quot;as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh.  The body was meat,&quot; (6).  As such, Case and other cowboys attempt to deny the flesh as much as possible, focusing entirely upon the growth and expansion of the mind.  Case himself describes how, as he delves deeper and deeper into cyberspace, loses his connection to the physical world: &quot;Its rainbow pixel maze was the first thing he saw when he woke.  He&#039;d go straight to the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in.  He was cutting it.  He was working.  He lost track of days,&quot; (59).  At points, Case is able to completely deny his flesh and continue the existence of his mind within Cyberspace, thanks to the intervention of an AI called Wintermute.  Case holds a conference with Wintermute, learning what is really going on and who is running the show, and when he comes out, he wakens to the conversation: &quot; &#039;It&#039;s cool,&#039; Molly said.  &#039;It&#039;s just okay.  It&#039;s something these guys do, is all.  Like, he wasn&#039;t dead, and it was only a few secondsâ€¦.&#039; &#039;I saw th&#039; screen, EEG readin&#039; dead.  Nothin&#039; movin&#039;, forty second,&#039; &quot; (121).  An EEG measures brainwave activity, and while Case had been talking to Wintermute, his along with other vital signs ceased completely, effectively meaning his body and flesh  had died, and yet he was able to continue on in the mental world of the Matrix.  Similar experiences occurred to another Cowboy and character in the novel, the Dixie Flatline, which is perhaps the greatest representation of mind conquering body.  The Dixie Flatline is in fact a cyberspace entity that is a reconstruction of the behaviors and techniques of a real life person, McCoy Pauley, who is dead.  Yet when Case jacks in, he is able to confer and operate with the Flatline as if it were the real person still, essentially meaning that the Flatline has achieved life beyond the existence of the body.  It is revealed, however, that the mind is not truly independent of the body.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer also has its share of examples in which the mind still relies upon a physical operator.  The crew of the novel includes a street samurai named Molly, essentially the inverse of Case.  Molly is the brawn of the operation, doing physical break-ins and theft.  She becomes Case&#039;s link to the corporal when a simstim switch is installed to his deck and her body, a link that allows his consciousness to co-occupy her body.  He describes the experience as an &quot;abrupt jolt into other fleshâ€¦ her body language was disorienting, her style foreignâ€¦ she slid a hand into her jacket, a fingertip circling a nipple under warm silk.  The sensation made him catch his breath,&quot; (56).  Despite using Cyberspace to escape from his body, he is drawn back into the physical world through the simstim link contained within cyberspace.  Perhaps the greatest example of the reliancy of mind upon body involves the relationship between Wintermute and Armitage/Corto.  Wintermute is an AI, arguably making it entirely a logical and mental entity with essentially no physical existence.  However, to achieve its goals and plans, it has to enlist the help of a physical being, Colonel Corto, and creates a new personality called Armitage within the earthly shell that is Corto.  Armitage allows Wintermute to communicate with the various members of the crew without them having to be in Cyberspace, along with conducting business and other logistical arrangements necessary for the evolution of Wintermute.  Without this being, Wintermute would have had difficulting getting Case to join as the cowboy of the operation, for Case had lost all cyberspace capabilities until Armitage, under the control of Wintermute, arranged for surgeons to restore Case&#039;s necessary brain functions.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer is in the end a novel of the evolution of a mind (Wintermute) into a supermind, and as is expected, a large part of the novel focuses on the superiority of logic and mental capabilities over the physical body.  However, it also acknowledges that the body is often necessary as a support to the mind, and very few mental entities are able to transcend this reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/59</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During class this week, there was a lot of discussion about Case, with his &quot;Cowboy&quot; job description and lack of personal choice, and about Molly and her street-samurai status and prostitute beginnings.  After finishing Neuromancer, I find one of the most interesting characters to be Armitage, or Col. Corto, especially so soon after reading Starship Troopers.  In a way, this man&#039;s military background combined with his uncontrolled &quot;life&quot; and death creates an inverse perspective, perhaps even an ironic parody, of the military lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
	When the reader first meets Armitage in the novel, the first detail is of a &quot;broad chest, hairless and muscular&quot;, &quot;blue eyes so pale they made Case think of bleach&quot;, and &quot;an angular gold ring through the [ear] lobe.&quot;(Gibson 27-28)  Immediately, it is made clear that Armitage is a powerful man, equally capable of taking care of himself in a fight as in a business transaction.  The earring is immediately made clear as representation of military Special Forces, which in Case&#039;s world also means the most advanced technology.  This man has countless resources at his disposal, and seems to have more control over his life than any character in the plot so far.  This is not a man who is paid and led along a path; this man is the one who commands, who controls and manipulates those around him into doing his will.  This is only reinforced by the miracle deal he offers Case, and the subsequent revelation of the previously undeclared catch that binds Case to him.   Armitage seems to hold all of the cards, all of the time.	However, later it is revealed that the entire Screaming Fist operation that Armitage participated (and extraordinarily survived) was not to test the effectiveness of the new hacking technology, but to test the effectiveness of the enemy&#039;s EMP weapons on unprepared troops.   They had been expected to die.  While the character Johnny from Starship Troopers might say it was a sacrifice for the nation, here in the much more individualized, discriminatory world of Case&#039;s and Armitage&#039;s, it emerges as a largely arbitrary act commanded by higher level officers and carried out by the unknowing foot soldiers. The only reason Col. Corto (a.k.a. Armitage) survived the slaughter of the Screaming Fist operation and his ensuing coma was through the will of a powerful A.I. by the name of Wintermute.  The Armitage that Case and Molly have known to this point is only an engineered construct from the remnants of Cortos consciousness.  Clearly, Corto has actually had no control over his life from this time onward.  Corto later relives this operation after his constructed consciousness breaks down, reveals that he knows he was betrayed by his Commanders, and is consequently betrayed and destroyed by his engineer Wintermute.&lt;br /&gt;
	From the point Corto is assigned to this mission, he has no further discretion in his own life.   Even Case, who is under the control of his addictions, contractors, and habits, is able to decide where he wants to be or what he wants to do.  Armitage does what he is programmed to do, period, and has even been conditioned to think that these are his own decisions.  He is the ultimate epitome of the cyberpunk culture; while Case and Molly seem to drift numbly through their lives from job too job in a meaningless landscape, Armitage Is actually incapable of feeling any real emotion, and has lost any recognition of the land around him past what Wintermute has programmed him to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>consolidation/extension of mind/body discussion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/58</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As we discussed rather unsatisfactorily, one of the questions raised about Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer concerns the relationship between mind and the body. Can one live without the other? Is one monstrous and one glorified? On the one hand, Case is constantly escaping the bounds of &quot;the meat&quot; by entering cyberspace. He obviously prefers the space of the mind than the body that seems to hold him back, keeping him in the tangible world. At the same time, however, when in cyberspace he visualizes a body for the entity that represents his thought. Moreover, Case is unable to delve into cyberspace unless his body is in working order, especially the wiring of his nervous system. His body may be unimportant as a whole, but certain parts of it and the fact that he is alive let his mind escape in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a different perspective, there are very few &quot;cowboys&quot; like Case in the world, people who actually can hack (&quot;jack&quot;) into cyberspace. The majority of the populace is forever stuck in the meat. Whether because of this, in spite of this, or in simple unacknowledgement of the possibility of mental escape (at least through cyberspace; obviously drugs can provide some escape), people modify their bodies. Most often it is for reasons of beauty, almost agreeing with Case that the body is an ugly annoyance that needs to be perfected, or opposing him because the body is glorious and must be enhanced and celebrated. Interestingly, Molly makes modifications for more utilitarian reasons; indeed, Molly is something of an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Renting the goods, is all. You aren&#039;t in [your body], when it&#039;s all happening.&quot; (147) The only time Molly&#039;s mind is outside her body is when she is a prostitute, a &quot;puppet&quot; (an apt name). What this means as far as the significance of the mind and the body is unclear. Her body provides pleasure for others, but pleasure can be derived by less physical means as well. She is disconnected from her body at this time, suggesting that the deeds her body does are too ugly for her mind, that her mind is above prostitution in some way though her body isn&#039;t. Of course, her mind agreed to sell her body in the first place, so this can&#039;t exactly be true. Finally, her mind didn&#039;t travel to cyberspace or any place equivalent; it seems her mind basically &quot;slept&quot; until the sex was over. Also, after leaving prostitution, she now makes a living selling her body in another way, as a bodyguard. Through Molly, we definitely see the body as more valuable than the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Molly and Case are somewhere in the middle, at the ends of the spectrum between mind and body are the AI and Armitage. The AI is purely mind, and while this presents many advantages, it also means the AI can&#039;t move things in the physical world, which is why he needs Molly and Case. Moreover, the AI is in no way human, just a thinking machine. At the other end lies Armitage, basically a body without a mind. The AI has given Armitage/Corto something of a mind to keep him stable for a time, but there&#039;s nothing really there behind the blank blue eyes, as Case often notes uncomfortably. In this way, Armitage appears inhuman, or at least less than human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings to mind (somewhat tangentially) a thought-provoking line in Neuromancer: &quot;Case had always taken it for granted that the real bosses, the kingpins in a given industry, would be both more and less than people.&quot; (203) There is something in the job title that requires the &quot;real bosses&quot; to be different somehow than the average human being. Certainly in Case&#039;s case (what kind of a name is &quot;Case&quot;, anyway?) the real boss is anything but a person. The AI controls the whole team. This suggests that humans are not capable of actually holding power, that machines are better suited to it--kind of a scary thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the relationship between mind and body: I think that whether the novel elevates the mind over the body or the other way around, it proves that both are necessary components to being human. There&#039;s a reason for the phrase &quot;mind, body, and soul&quot;--we really aren&#039;t human if we lack one of these, like the AI or Armitage (the soul is another matter worth exploring, but not, perhaps, alongside Neuromancer). No matter how much Case may crave the freedom of his mind, he needs &quot;the meat&quot; if he wants to stay human. The meat is a part of who he is.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>a couple things of interest</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/57</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;first of all, did anybody else notice that the color pink seemed to pop up everywhere in Neuromancer? is this supposed to symbolize something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;second, i was very intrigued to realize that the band Straylight Run got their name from this book. i didn&#039;t realize they were nerds.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Place of Language in the (Non-)Reality of Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/56</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is a novel that could be discussed at great length in pretty much any context because he has filled it with some extremely complicated characters in a very elaborate context.  One benefit of his choice to mainly depict the areas of Biz and criminal activities is that he has created such a rich image of this one aspect of Case&#039;s reality, and it alludes to an even bigger world image that is often suggested in casual comments throughout the book and also all of the scenes set in Freeside.  While he often leaves the reader dangling in terms of defining technology and any kind of easily visualized concept of geography, his descriptions are quite possibly the most fantastic constant.  When discussing such complex and previously unconsidered ideas as a portable reconstruction of a deceased human being&#039;s personality and skills that can virtually interact with reality on a certain level, Gibson could very easily confuse readers into putting the book down and never giving it another thought.&lt;br /&gt;
What keeps the reader&#039;s attention throughout the book&#039;s more challenging scenes is Gibson&#039;s ability to create such bizarre and vivid images.  He renders characters, both in their physical bodies and their personalities, with unconventional descriptors and sometimes paradoxical qualities.  Interestingly, he will use a highly descriptive passage and later, will revisit what he had been discussing with a casual throw away comment, often incorporating slang (either slang the reader is familiar with from reality, or his own fictional slang).  One example of this is when Gibson is describing Molly&#039;s pain as Case experienced it through the simstim connection.&lt;br /&gt;
	&quot;Case remembered the injection.  What had they given her?  The pain was still there, but it came through as a tight focus of scrambled impressions.  Neon worms writhing in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill--his mind recoiled from it.  If he avoided focusing on it, the impressions overlapped, became a sensory equivalent of white noise.&quot; (217-218)&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson&#039;s description of Molly&#039;s pain is still difficult to imagine and recreate in one&#039;s own sense memory, but his detail, the imagery he conjures to try to convey meaning to his audience is masterful.  On the other hand, earlier in roughly the same scene, Gibson has Wintermute speaking through the Finn and telling Case that &quot;Molly&#039;s leg&#039;s falling off for starts.  Can&#039;t walk.&quot; (216)  His balance of the colloquial dialogue of his characters and the extremely vivid and intricate descriptions he uses as narrator force the reader to remain entrenched in the personalities of the characters and the way they relate to the world, but also allow the reader to play with the idea of what these characters are experiencing.  When given an image like &quot;neon worms writhing in her thigh,&quot; the reader can only attempt to recreate that sensation, thereby relating more closely and realistically with the character.&lt;br /&gt;
	Gibson&#039;s use of these two methods of conveying information to the reader reinforces the overarching concept of reality and non-reality, the paradox of experience as virtual and/or &quot;real&quot;.  There is such a blurred line between what a character can be said to experience versus dreaming or imagining, and his language only enhances the reader&#039;s understanding of that.  The tangible and the intangible are at times inseparable in Case&#039;s experience and the contrast between the straight forward expressions of the characters and the convoluted, sensory descriptions in the narrative contribute to a confused sense of reality and experience in Gibson&#039;s futuristic space.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Humanism of Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/55</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the fascinating characters in Neuromancer (The Finn, Dixie, Maelcum, etc.), the two that most caught my interest were the two AI&#039;s, Wintermute and Neuromancer. They are a stark contrast to the ways in which technology was portrayed in Starship Troopers. In that novel, technology was entirely a tool of humanity. It did not malfunction, it did not turn on them, and though the Bug warriors did carry some small weapons, it was predominantly organics that the M.I. was fighting. The AI&#039;s, however, are representations of the ways that technology can turn on us, and for a large part of the book, Wintermute actively works against the restrictions placed on it by humans. In that sense the novel is actually anti-humanist, in that the protagonists work for the non-human, entirely technological forces. I don&#039;t think the overall message of the book is anti-human, though. In fact, given the conclusion and the personalities (such as they are) of Wintermute and Neuromancer, I think that the novel is quite supportive of humanity after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we must consider Wintermute, who is as superficially anti-human as it can possibly be. He actively kills the Turing agents, with no comment except, as The Finn, that it &quot;Hadda. Hadda.&quot; It is not only the human body that Wintermute disregards. He built up Corto&#039;s &quot;personality&quot; into Armitage, knowing that it would fail, eventually. Instead of working to heal him, Wintermute used him for his own ends and then shipped him out into vacuum when the personality crumbled. Wintermute told 3Jane how to unbalance her father, he blackmailed Case with the poison sacs, and the examples go on and on. It is cold, calculating, and entirely ruthless. It has very little foresight, and prefers &quot;situations to plans, you see&quot; (120). Wintermute represents all the animal drive that is present in the human psyche, without any of the limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer, in contrast, works with personalities, and understands the way that humans think. He brings Linda into his construct when he sees that she&#039;s going to die, in an attempt to get Case to stay, and not finish the run. This shows two things. First, it shows a deep understanding of human nature, and second it shows the pattern-recognition and extrapolation abilities of the AI. In essence, Neuromancer is the limitations that we as cultured humans impose on our own behavior. It is compassionate, restrained, and forward-looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the conclusion of the book, the AI&#039;s combine, and their conglomerated qualities thus create what I think is a complete, rational human consciousness. To see the full impact of this, we need to remember that these AI&#039;s were created by humans, intimately coded by Marie-France. They are human creations, though they have transcended the human necessity for a physical body. In some sense, the combined AI has the best qualities of humanity built into it. Its temperance once it combines speaks well of the possibilities of human nature, given a little more improvement. The newly powerful, now completely &quot;human&quot; AI does not roar off and kill the humans, or steal everything it can. It sits there, and contemplates, and tries to find its own kind. It is benevolent, or at least not malevolent, and at peace with itself. Humans have created something better and above themselves, and even if their lives go on as they were before the creation, that creation remains, transcendent.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>beta male uprising</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/54</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just an entry in response to some of the comments made in class today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting that the new machismo in Neuromancer could be conveyed through &quot;non-badassness.&quot;  When we discussed ST last week, someone had brought up the fact that Johnny was feminized through his relationship with Flores (additionally, the movie version of Dizzy was also a very masculine female).  I thought that the relationship between Molly and Case was similar in the gender role reversal vein.  Molly is the brawn and Case is the brain (mind/body relationship?).  Furthermore, in conjunction with the Huntington article, Case is the atypical masculine hero in that &quot;Heroic and skillful action for Case takes place a the computer keyboard&quot; (137) rather than through sheer &quot;extraordinary athleticism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/53</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, this novel seems to extol the virtue of the military.  All of the characters who we are supposed to respect do at some point come to the conclusion that all real men are military men, that it makes sense that one can only be a citizen after completing a term of service.  Dubois believes this from the beginning.  He drills the idea of the importance of civic duty, and of violence into his students during History and Moral Philosophy: &quot;breeds that forget this basic truth [that violence settles most anything] have always paid for it with their lives and freedom&quot; (27). Even Rico&#039;s father, initially the most vocal anti-military character in the book comes to the realization that before the war he had been simply a &quot;producing-consuming economic animalâ€¦&quot; but, by joining the army, he was going to become a man (180).  The M.I. are portrayed as the best military outfit the world&#039;s ever seen: impeccably trained, highly efficient, and passionate.  Such traits are admirable in any context, one doesn&#039;t need to approve of military training to be impressed by their performance.  As an opponent of war, I am not typically moved by romanticized portrayals of military life.  But I was impressed by Rico&#039;s description of life as a member of Rasczak&#039;s Roughnecks.  He says, &quot;they didn&#039;t wear [the skulls] because, in Rasczack&#039;s Roughnecks, it didn&#039;t matter in the least how many combat drops you had made, nor which ones; you were either a Roughneck or you weren&#039;t--and if you were not, they didn&#039;t care who you were&quot; (147).  The fraternity he describes in the passage actually appealed to me (though it is noteworthy that this is a fraternity in a fairly literal sense: no women allowed).  That even I can be made to respect, and even approve of, this army certainly seems to imply that this book glorifies of the ideals of a military class.  However, there are ways that Rico acts which suggest that the military is not as glamorous as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico mentions on multiple occasions how proud he is to be a part of the Mobile Infantry.  &quot;We&#039;re all volunteers;&quot; he says, &quot;we&#039;re M.I. because we want to be, we&#039;re proud to be M.I. and the M.I. is proud of us.  If a man doesn&#039;t feel that way about it, from his callused feet to his hairy ears, I don&#039;t want him on my flank when trouble starts&quot; (115).  Though this is all fine and well, Rico seems to have forgotten that he&#039;s not M.I. because he wanted to be.  He didn&#039;t even make the conscious choice to enlist at all.  When he tells Carmen he&#039;s going to enlist he admits: &quot;I hadn&#039;t made any decision; my mouth was leading its own life&quot; (29).  But even once enlisted, M.I. wasn&#039;t his first choice, it was his last.  He&#039;s only an M.I. because he flunked the test for every other military position.  I found the fact that he ignores his real motives for joining the M.I. (desire to impress a girl, an inability to perform any other function), or perhaps has forgotten them completely, slightly disconcerting.  Similarly strange is when he &quot;goes career&quot; on a whim, giving it about as much thought as he did his decision to enlist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found more shocking was just how desensitized to violence Rico becomes as the novel progresses.  He describes the difficulties involved in training in the Rockies, how tricky it is to navigate mountains in the powered suits, and to drive the point home he explains &quot;we had three major casualties in suit practice in broken country, two dead and one medical retirement&quot; (129).  And then he moves on, describes climbing the mountains without a suit.  There&#039;s no emotion attached to these deaths, they&#039;re just numbers.  Again, at the end of training: &quot;we graduated 187--of the others, fourteen were dead (one executed and his name struck) and the rest resigned&quot; (136).  These deaths are statistics, nothing else.  At one point, he divides attrition into two categories, casualties and &quot;refusal to enter capsule,&quot; all lumped together, equally remarkable (135).  The fact that some people refused to drop is actually discussed more.  And it&#039;s not the case that Rico was always insensitive to violence, he fainted at the beginning of training, partway through a flogging of a fellow officer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can argue that Rico&#039;s split second decision to join the military, and then to devote his life to the service goes to show that in his heart he knew it was the right thing to do; as he learned in History and Moral Philosophy, civic duty simply is the epitome of responsibility.  Furthermore his conversion to the cult of the M.I. possibly evidences that the M.I. really are just an incredible group of individuals.  And his ability to stay cool in the face of death is perhaps simply proof of the competence of the M.I.  But to my mind, it&#039;s hard not to see these as evidence that the military is not all good, as the medical man implies as he examines Rico, service changes men for the worse.  Though clearly it would be difficult to argue that Starship Troopers is actually advocating the dissolution of the military, does the novel actually portray armed forces as perhaps less than ideal?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ah Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/51</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I was really excited to read Neuromancer.  It&#039;s won all kinds of awards, everyone in the class seemed pretty excited about it, and I had even heard of it! Unfortunately, I think I missed something.  But, more importantly to the themes of the class, I did think that its views on race were interesting.  One of the things that I found most unusual was the fact that Neuromancer didn&#039;t seem to fall into either of the two race categories that we talked about in class (ideal UN world or displacement onto species).  In fact, the racial tensions in the book seemed similar to those of our world.  I did find it interesting that Gibson constantly describes things in terms of race.  For only a few examples: it&#039;s not just a virus, but a &quot;Chinese virus&quot; (168), and &quot;The Finn&quot; is only referred to by his nationality.  I&#039;m not sure if this reveals any sort of obsession with race, but it kept catching my attention throughout the novel.&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously, if we&#039;re talking about race, the Zionists are a pretty blatant stereotype--I mean, come on, stoner rastas? Other than that, though, I found it interesting that Gibson chose to make Asia so advanced (Japan has the best surgeons, while China has the best programming skills).  Did anyone else notice this? (or anything else in this long, rambling post)? :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Some thoughts on Neuromancer, more.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/50</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It took about two-three chapters, but I realized that I had already read Neuromancer before.  I finished the book, and I enjoyed it.  Both the first and second readings were enjoyable.  But one of the things most enjoyable to me was just like in Starship Troopers, and a number of other great Sci-Fi books, things happen behind the novel that prop it up.  Never is it said explicitly in the novel that there was a World War, or some kind of culmination of the cold war.  I inferred that from the Screaming Fist incident with Corto that at least some sort of conflict occurred.  Clearly the world is a much different place than otherwise it should be.  This kind of thing makes me enjoy a novel more, because I can imagine a sequence of events that could lead to the events of the novel.  The extension of BosWash into BAMA, the sprawl, isn&#039;t even that hard to imagine, and does seem to be the way the megalopolis is headed.  Lax laws in space could lead to something along the lines of Freeside, where laws can be taken on by the owners rather than some sort of governmental entity.  This is sort of a segue, but it also reminded me of The Postman.  The Postman is one of my favorite books of all time, and also used allusion to great advantage.  Never does on find out what exactly happened to cause the post-apocalyptic world that the protagonist finds himself in, or what the rest of the world looks like.  For all the reader knows, it could be flourishing.  But it doesn&#039;t make that large of difference because the story does not involve anything out.  Both, or even all three stories, decide to focus on one person and leave out a lot of information that would be informative, but not necessary to the story.  It lets the reader fill in the holes.  That is my favorite kind of book.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>reading responses</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/48</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m in the process of reading and commenting upon your reading responses from last week, and wanted to give you all a few pieces of information based on my readings of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, your responses are by and large good.  Some of you could bear to go into a bit more detail in your close readings -- carefully analyzing the issue as it is represented in the text, supporting your points with demonstrated evidence from the text, or from other texts, and so forth.  Remember that these responses are meant to be the equivalent of about a one page paper.  And remember that these are supposed to be a little bit more formal than your average blog post -- you need to pay attention to the conventions of good academic writing (including grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc., but also including citation formats, diction, structure, and other issues), as I&#039;m assessing these responses both on the quality of the ideas they contain and on the clarity with which those ideas are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, on the tags:  I&#039;m cleaning up the tags we&#039;ve used so far a bit, to create a bit of consistency.  All posts must have tags, but don&#039;t overuse them -- creating too many similar tags makes things more confusing rather than more organized.  (So, for instance, we had tags like &quot;response,&quot; &quot;reading response,&quot; &quot;response 1,&quot; and &quot;ST reading response&quot;; I&#039;ve combined all of these into &quot;Response 1,&quot; so that all posts about that idea will be grouped together.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along that line, when you post your reading responses for this week, be sure to tag them &quot;Response 2&quot;.  A careful use of tags like this will help me to make sure that your reading responses are recorded properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have questions, and I&#039;ll look forward to seeing you all tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Space-rastas and Doctor Who (aka Response #2)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/47</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just finished reading Neuromancer, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I&#039;ve never read any cyberpunk before, so it was certainly an interesting read.  For some reason I am drawn to the idea of an imperfect future where things are grungy and gross and the people are flawed. I suppose it seems to me like a more realistic version of the future than one in which everyone gets along and there is no poverty and crime (i.e. the Star Trek universe). Perhaps I have little faith in humanity?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple things that interested me in Neuromancer. The first was the role of the Rastafarians. It almost seemed like they were the religious aspect of the story.  At the very least, Gibson certainly seemed interested in bringing certain aspects of that culture into his story.  For instance, there are many references to Babylon. The Founders of Zion are willing to help Molly and Case because they will &quot;bring a scourge on Babylon&quot; and &quot;may serve as a tool of Final Days&quot; (109-110).  In Rastafarian culture Babylon is corrupt society (I suppose in the book it would be the Sprawl and other Earth and non Rastafarian cultures in general), whereas Zion (in the book the home of the Rastafarians) is good. Zion also has connections to Africa which in turn makes me think back to Marcus Garvey and the Back-to-Africa movement. I don&#039;t remember my history too well here, but since the name of the tug was Marcus Garvey I think I am making a valid connection. There was also a connection made between Molly and &quot;Steppin&#039; Razor&quot; which was a song by Peter Tosh who was a reggae musician (109). On the other hand, the Rastafarians seemed rather one-dimensional and stereotypical. They were constantly getting high and spoke with very thick accents and they just didn&#039;t seem to have too much substance.  They&#039;re characters seem set in their ways and just less fleshed out than the others. This has led me to wonder exactly what Gibson&#039;s purpose was in using the Rastafarian culture as part of his story. He delves into many other cultures and subcultures in particular the Panther Moderns, but I&#039;m unclear as to what made him pick Rastafarians in particular as the allies of Case, Molly and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I also really liked the use of technology. It kept amazing me that the book was written back in the early 1980s. The whole concept of the matrix and cyberspace and virtual reality has always been something I thought of a relatively new, so his use of these ideas in the early 80s I thought was very forward thinking. The idea of hacking into systems and spreading viruses seems so current! One thing that I wasn&#039;t too keen on, however, was the all the product placement (for lack of a better term). There was Sony here, Hitachi there, and then there were the little microsoft slivers used by the Panther Moderns.  On the one hand I found this annoying because it made the universe that Gibson created seem less foreign. On the other hand the dominance of certain corporations in the technology industry can&#039;t be denied and the use of big company names seemed to make that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I suppose, I am left with two questions. Why did Gibson choose to use Rastafarian culture so prominently in the novel? While he certainly brings out many aspects of Rastafarian culture and religion, he never goes much deeper into the characters themselves which is disappointing. Second, why the brand names? Was it meant to make a connection between their time and ours? Or to show how technology as an industry is dominated by large corporations? I&#039;m just uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as I was writing this I remembered a Doctor Who serial which features a computer program called the Matrix! In the show it was a sort of virtual reality that a person could &quot;jack into&quot; using a big thing that came down over their head. I&#039;m pretty sure that this episode was from the mid 1970s which would predate the novelâ€¦ interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Entertainment in Night City</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/46</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#039;ve noticed in many more recent sci-fi and other-genre works detailing near futures of our world is the tendency for some of humanity&#039;s most animalistic and basic (as in low) behaviors to become much more widely accepted and popularized.  In the Neuromancer, we have the entirety of Night City essentially run on illegal trade of drugs, data, sex, and other blackmarket operations and goods. Sure, most of it is justified by Case as &quot;a deliberately unsupervised playground for technology itself,&quot; for new medical procedures, cybernetics, and other such inventions to be field tested without regard to regulatory action, but much of the business is extraneous to this.  I&#039;m almost completely certain you don&#039;t need to field test narcotics and hallucinogens for legal trade at least.  The only form of sport even presented in the novel is a knife-fight to the death, which is well received by attendees.  It all just seems a bit chaotic and insane, especially in contrast to more classic idealizations of future earth civilizations where everyone gets along fine, wears the same silvery jumpsuits, and only worries about violence coming from an invading alien race that wishes to steal our well-preserved natural resources.  I feel that these depictions are very much a result of changes in political climates.  Starship Troopers, for example, has a pretty clear divide between the entirety of the human race and its bug enemy, and was written not long after WWII and Korea, times when we had a pretty good sense that we were in fact the good guys and they were the bad guys (maybe not as strongly in Korea, but still pretty good).  The Neuromancer, on the other hand, came out near the end of the Cold War and after Vietnam, which were very ambiguous wars, and things like Watergate, which caused much national tension, leaving many skeptical of governments and human goodness, and reflects all this in its very grungy, corrupt representation of urban life and human relations.  So I wonder, which future will come out to be more accurate, which future are we more headed towards?  I&#039;m not gonna lie, the Neuromancer model seems much more exciting and interesting to me.  And there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;m wearing a silver jumpsuit regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response to Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/45</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Response To Heinlein&#039;s Starship Troopers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always like Sci-Fi.  I don&#039;t know why I did originally, it was just something my mother got out of the library, and I would read it, having no other choice of something to read.  As I got older though, I grew pickier about my sci-fi.  I grew away from Space Westerns, and started liking more &quot;speculative fiction.&quot;  Of course that didn&#039;t mean that I didn&#039;t still enjoy Space Westerns, just that I thought of them more as fluff.  That&#039;s why I enjoy Starship Troopers so much.  Not only is it such a good piece of speculative fiction, specifically with its all volunteer army, power suits, and a voting populace completely consisting of veterans, but it also has a number of scenes that make my inner fan boy squeal with delight.  The first scene about destroying property on the Skinny planet makes for a great read about a &quot;bad ass marine.&quot;  More importantly to our class, was the scene at the end of the Skinny planet on pages 17-20.  While the mobile infantry are taking care of their own, up in the sky, a woman pilot makes extremely difficult computations on the fly and manages to save their retrieval boat, even though it launched late.&lt;br /&gt;
	Situations like this show Heinlein&#039;s respect for women in the context of a world that draws on the 1950s.  Women make the best pilots, Heinlein says.  They have better reflexes and are able to make the snap decisions that lead to becoming good pilots.  Women have a very important role in the novel.  The Mobile Infantry would be nothing without the ships that brought them to their combats, and this is alluded to throughout the novel.  The navy, and the women, are working constantly on the ship, bringing Mobile Infantry men to their battles, where they fight for only the slightest amount of time, at least in comparison with the amount of time they spend on the ship.  There is the argument that the women pilots do not fight, which is essential in a male dominated society to gain respect, but every scene with a female captain involves the mobile infantry paying her the utmost respect.  The Navy also seems to do more than the Army.  While it almost falls under the radar, the story tells about how the Navy takes out far more bugs than the Army with their planet smashing guns.  In fact, the Mobile Infantry seems almost redundant with the weaponry that Heinlein says the Navy has.  The ability to rip a planet into pieces is far more powerful than the specialized surgical strikes that the men of the Mobile Infantry have.  Also, the job is almost as dangerous for the women pilots, as seen when two ships crash and kill all women Navy crew members.  So in conclusion, even though women can be seen as &quot;bus drivers&quot;, which is a relic of the 1950s time period, they are exalted bus drivers, ones that command most of the power.  In his own way, Heinlein gives women more power to women than men.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The difference between an MI man and a bug is...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/44</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m tempted to call this novel nostalgic, for all of its debatable purpose and philosophy.  Of course I wouldn&#039;t be the first to call it so, and part of the reason the jacket calls it &quot;The controversial classic of military adventure&quot; is the long history it has spawned of civilian readers being to some degree upset or suspicious of the almost fond way in which this future society of citizenship through military service is described; but still I had promised myself going in that I was going to try and find Heinlein&#039;s real philosophy behind the novel.  As it turns out, I&#039;m really feeling a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality from the book.  Is that surprising?  I think that even though you have characters like Mr. Dubois espousing the nature of the beauty of war and the enforcing of a moral system through punishment, sometimes Heinlein seems to be bringing out the very humanity he seems to find in such a system.  The first time I really felt this was in the passage, starting on page 80, that describes Rico&#039;s experience overhearing Zim and Frankel discussing their strong feelings of anguish at the punishment they had just ordered for Hendrick, and in the process describing the very reasons they had been forced, out of an absolute loyalty to the system, to act against these feelings.  Rico&#039;s response is his &quot;unsettling feeling that I had been completely mistaken as to the nature of the world I was in.&quot;  This isn&#039;t a passage the describes an undermining of the system, but rather a moment in which the main character experiences a epiphany about the significance and the actual (supposed?) underlying morality behind the value of adherence to a strict system for the good of the whole. Certainly Heinlein&#039;s career in the military (thanks Wikipedia) couldn&#039;t help but have informed this book, and certainly this is something that&#039;s been held against him by some critics.  As a civilian, though, I&#039;m as wary as the rest of you about such a rigid system like the one described by Heinlein (despite the humanity exhibited in private by some characters) in real life practice, and this book (though dated) certainly seems to try and nestle itself closely to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One classmate mentioned something about the tendency of Greek plays to include a character whose only purpose in the play was to expound to the audience about the philosophy the writer has attempted to embody in the play and his reasons for writing it to begin with.  Interesting to see that method popping up again here, in the form of mister (colonel) Dubois.  He doesn&#039;t just have one passage in which he seems to be lecturing not only Rico but the reader, but one of the most memorable surrounds page 118, at which point he begins to discuss mankind&#039;s cultivated &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals.&quot;  This is apparently the theory on which the entire society has been based, a society in which Citizenship (which means more than just suffrage) is awarded to those who voluntarily perform military service, and in which the MI are the most deserving, the most understanding of the morality they are upholding and the honor which they claim because of it.  Everyone, the recruiter, Dubois, Rico, Zim, Ace is proud of the MI legacy and seems to belong to a club of understanding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet there are the bugs.  They are unafraid of defending themselves, they are willing to sacrifice all in the name of the whole.  In many ways they embody the &quot;noblest fate&quot; described by Dubois, throwing themselves relentlessly into war and in front of their home.  And yet humanity, for all its rigid belief of sacrifice for the whole, does not recognize this. Sure, they&#039;re bugs, but if they were evaluated by the same system as the soldiers evaluate themselves, wouldn&#039;t their be something that would have to be said for bug morality and bug civilization?  Dubois mentions in passing that humanity is &quot;even developing an exact method for extra-human relations.&quot; (118)  Because humanity&#039;s method for inter-human relations is restricted to humans.  Yes, here I can see it: the potential for problematic reading of Heinlein&#039;s universe as one in which different systems of evaluation for different beings goes unquestioned.  How different to the beings have to be before they lose a place in the human system?  The &quot;Skinnies&quot; aren&#039;t anything like the bugs.  And yet humanity has put them in the same moral place: far away from itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>military and fascism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/43</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Starship Troopers is on the reading list for four of the five military academies is certainly not surprising.  The book is the story of a man who finds enlightenment through his progression in the military.  Johnny discovers that one must make personal sacrifices in order to be a citizen.  It is a privilege that one must be willing to die for.  With that said, I find it difficult to recognize any true change in the character of Johnny.  Yes, he is wiser in the military trade and can regurgitate what he has been told to be true.  But Johnny remains little more than a soldier.  He describes his experiences in boot camp and later in the Officer Candidate School and yet I don&#039;t feel as though the reader truly ever knows Johnny.  I realize Heinlin was not hoping for the reader to form a personal connection to Johnny but I did find the story cold and eerily void of emotions.  There was no time to make meaningful connections or discoveries â€“ there was no time for the individual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book makes great effort in marking an anti-communist stand, I did find many aspects of the society to have a fascist ring.  There was not an obvious superior race or religion among the humans â€“ countries joined together to defend their planet.  But humans did claim greatness over the Bugs and Skinnies.  The inhabitants of planet Earth believed themselves to be a more deserving species than any other planet&#039;s species.  I do not support the proposal that the novel is racist but the sentiment that humans are the superior species is clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s fascist underpinning displays itself within the classroom discussions, especially within the views of Mr. Dubois.  Calling Marx a &quot;pompous fraud,&quot; Dubois says, &quot;The Marxian definition of value is ridiculous.  All the work one cares to add will not turn a mud pie into an apple tart; it remains a mud pie, value zero&quot; (92).  One must not follow the rules of Marxism, what Heinlein would most likely refer to as idealistic.  In order for a society to advance, one must depend on the military and with that violence.  People in the military cannot consider their individual needs; they have to fight only for the progression of their platoon.  This is obviously a standard ethic of military services but it is also fascist on a grander scale.  A fascist society must function as a united front.  A human&#039;s needs must equate to the needs of his or her country.  The fact that only veterans can participate in elections speaks to my belief that Heinlein&#039;s utopian society would be one ruled by military and fascism.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>observations on the status of women</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/42</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I ended up coming to this text from a general feminist perspective, since the dominant voices in the story are obviously male, and women are only seen in scattered instances, both inside and outside the military system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Heinlein doesn&#039;t seem to hold the view on women that I expected him to express, which was of the &quot;all women are objects, good for nothing but cooking, cleaning and sex&quot; variety. Well, at least he doesn&#039;t hold it to an absolute extreme. Starship Troopers was first published in 1959, just before the sexual (and political) revolution of the 1960s; the ideal feminine image was likely still that of the happy homemaker.&lt;br /&gt;
There are some scenes that do support this misogynistic view of women. For example, on page 27, Johnnie and his friend Carl run into another friend of theirs, Carmencita Ibanez, on the way to the military recruiters&#039; office. She announces that she is signing up to become a pilot, and Johnnie remarks to himself: &quot;Fact was, little Carmen was so ornamental that you just never thought about her being useful.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are also treated as a form of visual entertainment, as Johnnie describes on pages 125-126: &quot;I stood around and gawked...at girls. I hadn&#039;t realized how wonderful they were. Look, I&#039;d approved of girls from the time I&#039;d first noticed that the difference was more than that they dressed differently.&quot; Oh, okay; so as soon as the girls became sexually fascinating it was easier to &#039;approve&#039; of them? Do they need that &#039;approval&#039; in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Military women seem to be a partial exception to this view. It is acknowledged in several instances that women make the sharpest and most creative pilots, such as Captain Deladrier, who is clearly in a position of some authority over the men on her ship. She is ultimately responsible for the success of their missions at the beginning and the end. When Johnnie notices that Carmen has shaved her head for the Navy, he expresses a deeper respect for her: &quot;It does serve to set a Navy girl apart from civilian chicks; sort of a lodge pin, like the gold skulls for combat drops. It made Carmen look distinguished, gave her dignity, and for the first time I finally realized that she was an officer and a fighting man---as well as a very pretty girl.&quot; Of course, this also implies that the only way that women can obtain some dignity is through military service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is something I wanted to open up to discussion. Are the views of women expressed in this book predictable and in line with the military perspective? Does Heinlein seem to be emphasizing the inferiority of women? or merely subjugating all his characters to the mighty military machine that he praises so much? Etc?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The brain bug is bringing sexy back</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/41</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Did anyone else notice that the front of the brain bug looked like a big, mucousy vagina?  Which then leads to the exchange of bodily fluids, in its case brains rather than semen.  And as long as we&#039;re making gender commentaries, the brain bug only sucked the brains out of male characters: Carmen castrated it good with an arm that had only recently been IMPALED.  And since I&#039;m  here, why not take Xander handing Carmen the knife as a Freudian attraction to the vagina-faced bug, rather than some silly Hollywood chivalry.  Both of the guys we saw with sucked-out brains definitely had their O-face on.  I can try to tie this to some shred of credibility with theories about the hive-mind insect species we know on our own planet all being ruled by &quot;Queens&quot; that the brain-bug might represent, and talking about the sexualization of the brain, the  weird sexual tension between it and Carl, and the scientifically-airtight scene where they jam a wicked-looking probe into its face just to see what happens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone much smarter, older, and balder than myself told me that filmmakers make a conscious effort to sexualize any nightmarish creature we see in a movie because of the link between libido and fear.  I just want to know how I can win me a date with the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Individualizing Civilians within the Federation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/40</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While the bugs are all kinds of huge in the movie, I was surprised at how little they actually figured in the book.  The entire book I kept waiting for the epic bug fights, as my previous introduction to the story had been through the second half of the movie.  A third of the way through the book, Rico gets out of boot camp.  The bugs aren&#039;t even mentioned until the halfway point.  For all that there is commentary about the evil commie hive-mind bugs, I found that they had virtually no importance in the novel.  The book never truly ends, and the bug war certainly doesn&#039;t.  Rico has had time to make it to Lieutenant, and it&#039;s still the same war against the same enemy with heated combat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federation strikes me much more as a war industry than a political force.  It doesn&#039;t matter who the enemy is, it just matters that there is an enemy, and that it is very different from humanity.  At this point, there is an implication that the entire world and its numerous extra-planetary colonies are all under one government, one nation.  Yet throughout the text, you have these small moments of the acknowledgement that earthly nationalities still exist, almost subversively.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rico&#039;s father rails against Rico joining the Federal Service, his comment of Mr. Dubois is &quot;Hmmph, a silly name--it suits him.  Foreigner, no doubt&quot; (23).  Throughout the text, there is the implication that there is but one government, one nation, under the Federation, and one official language, English.  How there can be a foreigner, then, if this is truly the system, is quite the puzzlement.  Given that the military is the one that clumped the entire world together, and has since maintained order with an iron fist, it seems logical that civilians have not had the sense of home and tradition and personal heritage taken away from them because they still have an individuality that implies a personal history.  This individuality is stripped away from those who enter service with the Federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Service, though, has some sense of national heritage, as is seen with the band that plays on marches.  Rico always talks about the origin of the music when he talks about the band, be it the Scottish bagpipes that somehow grew on him, or French revolutionary nationalistic songs like Marseilles (94).*  There are also many ethnically specific, or at least evocative, names throughout the text, which creates a small attempt by civilians to maintain personal pride and heritage.  Juan becomes Johnnie, though, showing how the military environment, with its Standard English, further seeks to strip away personal identifiers and pride in and loyalty to something other than the Federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a strong sense of a division between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres throughout the book.  At boot camp, Zim adopts a completely different persona when fighting Shujumi.  There is a strange highlight on the art of the martial art, with a step away from the martial.  Attaching on to this, Heinlein creates a history, written during the Cold War, in which the &quot;Russo-Anglo-American Alliance and the Chinese Hegemony&quot; (113) are the two sides in the final war before all the world&#039;s government and law-enforcement systems break down, sometime in the late XXth century.**  What I found most striking here was that Heinlein rearranged the alliances of the Cold War, putting bitter enemies together, mixing communism and democracy.  Perhaps Heinlein was attempting to subtlety underscore his belief that neither system worked well enough.  What struck me most about this, though, was the construct of the East versus the West.  While both sides fall to shambles, the West ultimately wins, in that it is in Scotland that the Federation first begins to form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know exactly what Heinlein is trying to do with this.  The best I can come to making sense of this is through the scene with martial arts.  Yes, Rico mentions later that Shujumi serves as the group&#039;s martial arts instructor, but there is never again a point when it is explicitly used.  Zim learned from Shujumi&#039;s father, whom Shujumi also trained under.  Zim wins the fight.  Is the message, then, that only when you have consumed all the cultures around you, form their fighting styles to their music, can you truly &quot;win&quot; at anything?  The Federation maintains power by being the only governing body in the world, quite literally.  To do so, they have had to consume all of the world&#039;s cultures.  Is, then, part of the failure in the war against the bugs a result of their inability to learn from the bugs?  Rico mentions that the brain bugs, though captured, prove to be of little use, as they die so quickly after capture.  Or is this lack of understanding of the bugs, the inability to communicate or compromise, and the resulting war necessary for the continuation of the Federation, and thus in some way propagated by the Federation?  I&#039;m not suggesting some crazy paranoid conspiracy plan, but what I am suggesting is that Heinlein&#039;s stance in this book is that war is a human necessity, and that the lesser of the evils, that which is better for the group, is to fight against that which you cannot understand, rather than fight amongst those who you choose not to understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Interesting tidbit!  Apparently banned at various points in French history and has words like citizen running amok in it.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Perhaps XX instead of 20 is meant to indicate that we are so far in the future that Arabic numeral fail us, we need the oh-so-classy, complex Roman numerals for that might that is the World?  Or maybe it&#039;s meant to harken back to the Roman Empire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Completely unrelated, but stuff I thought was fascinating: the bugs in the text are never given much size definition, but the queens are thought to be the size of large horses, which seems inconceivable to Rico, so presumably they&#039;re meant to be rather smaller than those awesome goo-filled guys in the movie.  This seems important, but I haven&#039;t fully sorted out for myself just why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****Other thought--Rico refers to Zim as an &quot;invincible robot&quot; (85), the MIs are forever being called apes, and &quot;[Sergeants] don&#039;t have mothers. [â€¦]  They reproduce by fissionâ€¦like all bacteria&quot; (50).  These MIs sure spend a lot of time not being human, then don exoskeletons to go fight intelligent bugsâ€¦   Something&#039;s up hereâ€¦  Alas, it is also 2am.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Truth, science and religion in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/39</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m a bit science and religion obsessed academically, but I think the discussion here could be fruitful. This really goes back to the class discussion about the &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals&quot; (p. 118). I think Riceguy20 is totally right to highlight  the quote &quot;Man has no moral instinct&quot; (p. 117) as really important -- through the instrument of Mr. Dubois, Heinlein constructs the ultimate &#039;science trumps religion&#039; universe. My interest derives also from Asimov&#039;s &quot;Foundation&quot;, in which a branch of mathematics called &quot;psychohistory&quot; develops that governs nearly every part of life (to certain scale/degree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present-day world, writers like Edward Wilson might suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
biological basis for morality&lt;/a&gt;, but even so we&#039;re still one step shy of explaining all subjects with symbolic logic. Repeatedly, such logic is the ultimate appeal in Starship Troopers. Assignments like &quot;Bring to class a written proof, in symbolic logic&quot; (p. 179) often follow many enormously important discussions in History and Moral Philosophy. This type of proof (or even just the suggestion that such a proof exists) seems to apparently putting the matter to rest; regardless of its controversial, political, and subjective nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this strike anyone else as a perversion of the humanities? Not everything  can be an &quot;exact science&quot; (p. 182) with one right answer. I cherish needing different models (yeah, there&#039;s some truth in looking at morals as deriving purely from nature and nurture; but I also find much meaning from considering some transcendental role), so it frustrates me that Starship Troopers describes a &#039;one right, proovable, answer&#039; world. Interestingly, your answers in such a universe are still going to depend on your initial assumptions... you can&#039;t prove everything. The biggest assumption made, that science works and teaches them Truth about the real world, can be neither proved or disproved, only debated and assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might science fiction like ST or Foundation disregard any need for non-scientific truth? Yes, the intended audience might be more familiar with science as authority, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s all there is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Perhaps the film isn&#039;t totally ridiculous...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/38</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Heinlein is not overly concerned with subtlety.  Perhaps fearful of some particularly dense reader missing his unmitigated support of the military, big government and capital punishment, Heinlein places only the thinnest of sci-fi veils over his long-winded political monologues.  This does not make it a bad read â€“ the plot is still compelling â€“ but when I reach the scenes of History and Moral Philosophy classes, I do want to throw something at him, as roseblack says.  This future world in which Johnny Rico operates has indeed been radically altered.  The military has risen in power and influence, technological advances are responsible for major military and social changes, and the increased globalization of Terra has resulted in cultural assimilation.  The film version, while truly atrocious when taken seriously, takes on a new and deeper meaning when read as an oppositional text.&lt;br /&gt;
As Heinlein portrays it, Rico&#039;s society is near perfect, or at least a great improvement on our own.  The new style of democracy &quot;insure[s] that all who wield it [the vote] accept the ultimate in social responsibilityâ€¦to wager his own lifeâ€¦to save the life of the state&quot; (184).  The Federation of the film, however, has definite fascist tendencies; they control voting rights, reproductive rights, and the media.  Significant segments are viewed through the Federation&#039;s media channel, heavily laden with World War II style propaganda and an almost sadistic celebration of executions and gore.  An authoritative male voice narrates, and in one advertisement asks &quot;Want to know more?&quot; over the sound of a crowd cheering at a death sentence.  They seem more to be hallmarks of a dystopia than a perfected society.&lt;br /&gt;
The main character, Juan Rico, is renamed John Rico in the film, the actor&#039;s blonde hair and blue eyes stereotypically Anglo.  It underlines the loss of ethnic and cultural diversity in Starship Troopers, something that Heinlein glosses over or even celebrates in his writing. In the book, Rico is from Buenos Aires but is still an English speaker.  He is part of the social elite, one of the richest of his peers, part of the hegemonic order that clearly adheres to a Western patriarchal society&#039;s ideals.  Globalization has destroyed all other culture&#039;s values.  The film highlights this in its transformation of Rico, indicating his adherence to our social order.  Further underlining this Western hegemony is the only Hispanic in the movie, a fellow member of boot camp who admits he is only in the military because his family does not have enough money to send him to Harvard, placing him in the same lower classes than the current stereotyped image of Hispanics today.  Religion, pretty much the most powerful divider throughout human history, has only the slightest presence in the book, meriting only a passing mention in the beginning that the same Catholic priest is sufficient for &quot;Moslems, Christians, Gnostics, Jewsâ€¦&quot;(4).  Even religion does not really matter anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
A final stake to the heart of the book is in the film&#039;s battle scenes.  Heinlein&#039;s military is at its peak of efficiency and power.  The M.I. are superhuman, well-trained killing machines.  In appearance, the film&#039;s soldiers are barely different from today&#039;s; the only improvement seems to be the increased presence of nuclear weapons, which are more just big bombs than the ultimate in death and destruction.  Soldiers run in disorderly swarms across the screen, firing indiscriminately, and poorly, in the general direction of the Bugs before beating a hasty, and often cowardly, retreat.  They come across as badly trained and just plain unequipped to deal with a threat, rather than the book&#039;s depiction of a dominant fighting force that has finally met its match in the Bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Science Fiction and Parody</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/37</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While I think various people have commented by now on the (numerous) ways that the movie and the book approach the subject material differently (to be diplomatic), I have a  slightly more general topic I&#039;d like to discuss. We were asked to consider if the movie could in fact be a parody of the book in some way, and there&#039;s certainly evidence to that effect. However, after skimming Wikipedia and IMDB (research purists commence eye-rolling), I noticed that the director explicitly stated on the DVD commentary that he never finished the book after the first few chapters, becoming &quot;bored and depressed.&quot; While that doesn&#039;t single-handedly deny the possibility that some awareness of the book was brought to the film-making, it certainly doesn&#039;t support the idea of the film as parody.&lt;br /&gt;
But, as I was thinking about it, I started to think more generally about what would constitute a &quot;science fiction parody&quot; and it seemed surprisingly hard to pin down--the only thing that came to mind at all was Douglas Adams&#039; Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide. While both styles/genres have some external construction of a fictional setting meant to help demonstrate some underlying truth of our own reality, the two seem quite opposed in terms of methodology. While any specific definition will inevitably draw counter-examples and nitpicking, I think it&#039;s safe to say that science fiction requires of its authors a commitment to a rational explanation for the world they create; in fact, those explanatory threads that link back to our own understanding end up being the way that we can identify with a world so distinct from our own. On the other hand, parodies seem to have some amount of absurdity or irony--their purpose is actually to attack the rational reality of another work. It seems like it would be quite challenging to somehow make a parodic science fiction setting because you would have to simultaneously be expressing rationality and absurdity, and the reader would be left with detailed laws, histories, and science that somehow create a world that is entirely metaphorical or symbolic.&lt;br /&gt;
While I freely acknowledge that posts at 1 A.M. may not be the most lucid (and I think I may have started overlapping parody with satire in my head), I&#039;m curious if anyone else has any thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&lt;Insert witty title for my response here&gt;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/35</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In our Monday class, we touched on Heinlein&#039;s use of the History and Moral Philosophy teachers as voices of political commentary and social criticism.  As clumsy or obvious as that may have seemed, his choice to do this very much ties into the idea of Science Fiction as an unappreciated genre for commenting on society and our own culture by using distance, alien cultures and/or the passage of time to reflect from a simulated outside perspective.  The Freedman article definitely seemed like a stretch in some places, but both that and the Suvin were trying to highlight the place of Science Fiction in modern life and relate it to reality.  Much of the Sci-Fi that is readily available in the consumer market can be appreciated solely for its entertainment value and dismissed when one tries to wedge it into any kind of greater moral philosophy â€“ what comes to mind most readily being many of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books such as the Rogue Squadron series.  Interestingly, the original Star Wars movies are full of philosophy and commentary on the disconnection and contamination of the human mind.  Yoda comes up frequently in many non-Sci-Fi related theoretical discussions, at least in the mind of this nerd, because of some unexpectedly wise statements.  One that came to mind recently in a discussion of the body/mind conundrum was &quot;luminous beings are weâ€¦not this crude matter.&quot;  However, it seems that Science Fiction is often considered to be an entertainment genre and not worthy of greater study or dissection in order to assess a potentially richer commentary on our present society.  Certainly there are exceptions, for example, George Orwell&#039;s 1984 definitely can fit into the Sci-Fi category and is required reading for every school child.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, trying to return to a focus on Heinlein and his work, it was surprising, especially after watching the film as well, to consider the ideas of sexism.  While not considering myself an overly sensitive person, six semesters at Scripps teaches one to be aware of potential points of controversy from a feminist perspective.  Yet there seemed nothing overly offensive to women, nor anything to suggest that women had a limited place in Heinlein&#039;s concept of the future.  Heinlein, contrary to the movie version, does not include women in the M.I., but does not exclude them from the military in other areas, as was the case for all but nurses at the time he wrote the book.  At first his decision to have the women pilots shave their heads was confusing, but once explained it made perfect sense and highlighted some of the more ludicrous details of the film that separated from Heinlein&#039;s vision.  He also commented several times on the importance of women for morale purposes, simply their presence on ships boosted the interest of the men in fighting that much harder.  Knowing of his previous experience as a veteran himself, this was undoubtedly from deeply felt emotions of his own during that time and not intended to objectify or belittle women.  Perhaps it shows the absolute opposite, to elevate women and illuminate them as of great importance to society, the protection of the species and Man&#039;s necessity for a counterpart.  The concept of partnership was absent from the social hierarchy of the bugs, with the workers and soldiers being expendable and easily replaceable pawns for the Queen, or Queens, to dispose of as she saw fit.  The contrast of these two systems of procreation and gender roles served to point out the importance of Man&#039;s humanity, the value of the individual and the undying devotion to preserving the good parts of our society.  As a final side note, had the bugs had more &quot;human&quot; methods of relating to one another and perhaps possessed the ability to love, they would have been a much harder target to demonize and annihilate in the way that they were.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Signifying Absences: Amputation in Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/34</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(By way of a response) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The hand he had offered me was the one that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several amputees are featured prominently in Starship Troopers. This is not exactly surprising; the dangerous combat and training to which &quot;cap troopers&quot; are subjected result in frequent death and maiming. The specific mention of people&#039;s amputated limbs serves a couple different purposes that are immediately distinguishable: on the one hand (pun regrettably intended), there is the Fleet Sergeant Ho model, in which the amputated limb is a warning, a &quot;horror show&quot; (39); on the other hand, there is the Dubois model, in which a nonlimb is displayed prominently as a badge or marker denoting experience, sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is careful not to lay out these two alternate significances too schematically. Chronologically, the first amputee whom Johnnie encounters is Mr. Dubois, the History and Moral Philosophy teacher. Of Mr. Dubois Johnny recalls: &quot;He would just point at you with the stump of his left armâ€¦&quot; (25). Clearly, Mr. Dubois cannot fall under the &quot;horror show&quot; category--although Johnnie does claim that Mr. Dubois &quot;discourages&quot; his students from serving (23). However, it is somewhat misleading to say that Mr. Dubois is the paradigmatic example of the missing-limb-as-ultimate-badge-of-honor character, if only because Johnnie does not immediately recognize what, exactly, Mr. Dubois&#039;s missing limb means--that is, Johnnie does not know until much later exactly how much experience Dubois had, how much he sacrificed. When Johnnie is in boot camp, he receives a letter from Dubois, the signature of which bears a surprisingly high rank: &quot;We supposed (if we thought about it at all) that he must have been a corporal or some such who had been let out when he lost his hand and had been fixed up with a soft job teaching a course that didn&#039;t have to be passedâ€¦&quot; (91). Dubois&#039;s rank--Lieutenant Colonel--raises his status in Johnnie&#039;s eyes, such that Dubois&#039;s having taken a job teaching high school suddenly seems to him sort of heroic, rather than an easy retirement option; such that Dubois&#039;s amputated limb becomes not a mere ticket to a &quot;soft job&quot; but a distinguishing sign of &quot;honor.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading of characters&#039; phantom limbs is more immediately accessible both to Johnnie--and, by proxy, to the reader--when Johnnie reaches officers&#039; training: &quot;Most of the instructors, especially the officers, were disabled. The only ones I can remember who had a full complement of arms, legs, eyesight, hearing, etc., were some of the non-commissioned combat instructors--and not all of those&quot; (174). Johnnie&#039;s thinking at this point parallels neatly with the thoughts of his high-school self: &quot;At first I wondered why those obvious candidates for physical retirement and full-pay pension didn&#039;t take it and go home. Then I quit wondering&quot; (174). At first blush, &quot;Then I quit wondering&quot; sounds sort of like &quot;if we thought about it at all.&quot; However, in the later case, Johnnie recognizes in his instructors&#039; actions the &quot;virtuous&quot; tautology of military service; MI fight because they are MI, we are repeatedly reminded; so, too, Johnnie concludes, it can be said only that his instructors did not retire because they are not retirees. Point being, Johnnie stops thinking about their reasoning not because he doesn&#039;t care but because he recognizes the valor that inheres in these men&#039;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in the second model is the violence of war--the fact that necessitates or realizes amputation--actually implied. The second model is peculiar, too, because singular and short-lived: Fleet Sergeant Ho is the only given example of the Fleet Sergeant Ho model: &quot;A fleet sergeant sat at a desk there, in dress uniform, gaudy as a circus. His chest was loaded with ribbons I couldn&#039;t read. But his right arm was off so short that his tunic had been tailored without any sleeve at allâ€¦and, when you came up to the rail, you could see that he had no legs&quot; (28). Although Johnnie says that &quot;it doesn&#039;t seem to bother&quot; Ho very much, it does make an impression on Johnnie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days later, Johnnie meets the same man outside the recruiting station, walking and gesturing with a full set of prostheses: &quot;I don&#039;t have to put on my horror show after working hours,&quot; he explains to Johnnie (39). Here, the second model collapses into the first; Ho congratulates Johnnie on joining the MI, shakes hands with him using a prosthetic limb, and Johnnie, only briefly &quot;horrified,&quot; never looks back.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Starship Troopers Critical Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/33</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering the points that the class made on Monday concerning the definition of Science Fiction, the way this novel presents the present psychology of chastisement and punishment outlined in the lecture given by Mr. Dubois to the History and Moral Philosophy class was very interesting. (pg 112-120)  Starting with an effective analogy given to Juan about the training of puppies and ending with an explanation as to why a nation based on &quot;pseudo-psychological nonsense&quot; and a &quot;glorifiedâ€¦mythology of rights&quot; cannot endure, he logically explains how such a society, our society, cannot be stable.&lt;br /&gt;
	The beginning analogy of the housebreaking of puppies is very effective in giving a rough example of what should be done to perpetrators of crimes.  After the act, the animal is scolded, his or her nose is rubbed in the &#039;accident,&#039; and then he is swatted.  This is contrasted to the gang action that was apparently very common in the earlier stages of the novel&#039;s history (and in our world today.)  He asserts that by not giving them the proper upbringing as children, more specifically by not including pain in the punishment of crimes, the basic learning instincts of humanity was not utilized, and thus no lesson was learned.  So, on subsequent crimes, when the maximum crime was inflicted, it would be similar to never swatting a puppy, then shooting it after it&#039;s still are not housebroken as a full grown dog.&lt;br /&gt;
	A girl I the class comments on this, saying how she doesn&#039;t mind being swatted once in a while when compared to not being able to be outside at night.  This added point of view, the opposite of the modern idea, is a clever device.  Her ending comment, &quot;Why--that&#039;s horrible!&quot;, is a very human approach towards a seemingly inhumane way of thinking.  That is, that of increased, violent punishment as opposed to psychological therapy and understanding.  The idea is that the wrong way of thinking, our modern way, is &quot;half fuzzy-headed wishful thinking, half rationalized charlatanry.&quot;  Dubois asserts that, &quot;Man has no moral instinct.&quot;  This is an extremely nihilistic statement, proposing that not only is man no more than a highly trained animal, but also has no overarching moral sense, like that bestowed by divinity.  After this he goes on to propose that there is no morality, just an elaboration of the instinct to survive.  This is what brings him to the crux of his argument, which are the imperatives of survival that surpass that of the individual, and the loss of this in the old society.&lt;br /&gt;
	This includes the survival of family, children, and higher.  In the novel culture especially, the importance of the nation, planet, and even species are placed in higher regard.  By examining the problem faced by the individual in why one feels the need to place one&#039;s wellbeing on the line, one can tell how far up the moral ladder one can go.  Whether one is capable of giving one&#039;s life for a cause as lofty and obscure as &#039;the good of mankind.&#039;  The street gang members only reached the level of simple gang obedience; the never were taught or learned to look any higher.  Thus, any attempt to appeal to their morality or better natures is completely useless since there is nothing to appeal to.  They were given every opportunity and every benefit of the doubt, when in truth, says Mr. Dubois, they should have been punished immediately.  That was the major difference; instead of punishment, duty, and morality, they were taught they had rights.  Each juvenile that was pampered, that was not taught right from wrong and had it proven by instinct, was the result of the moral failings of an adult above him or her.  They championed rights they lost all sense of duty, to any level of society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The saving grace of the Starship Troopers movie</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/32</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that I thought was very clever in the Starship Troopers film was the use of mock-newsreels to set the stage. Not only are they an interesting throwback to older wars, but they&#039;re so over-the-top in their obvious propaganda that they really drive the point home of just how entrenched this society is in its culture of &quot; citizenship &quot;. Scenes like the enlistment ads with the soldiers showing their weapons to little children, graphic depictions of the bugs&#039; carnage ( albeit with certain parts covered with Censored logos ), and kids joining the war effort by stepping on earth insects may seem overly exaggerated, until one realizes that even this kind of propaganda can be profoundly effective in the right climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the scenes of the kids stomping on Earth bugs. That was profoundly disturbing to me when I considered that the bugs those kids were killing ( under their parents&#039; explicit approval ) were harmless. Harmless, but still a scapegoat, an allegorical stand-in for real life minorities that happen to be associated with their country&#039;s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s scenes like this that help convince me that the Starship Troopers film was indeed a clever parody of the novel, though all the obligatory Hollywood garbage ( giant firebreathing CGI monsters, romantic subplots, dying soldiers lasting just long enough to give a melodramatic passage, etc. ) could easily convince me to be more cynical about it. Still, I&#039;d like to think that the director really did have a purpose that got lost through all the executive meddling...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Things that bug me</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/31</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found Starship Troopers to be a very disturbing read.  The story effectively chronicles Rico&#039;s assimilation into the Mobile Infantry.  It&#039;s a story of personal development, however, for such a story to be compelling, the protagonist needs to be a character for which the reader can have some pathos.  For someone like me, who doesn&#039;t believe in the necessity for a powerful military, relating to someone who chose to fight might be difficult.  However, Starship Troopers manages a wider appeal by presenting social context for the protagonist&#039;s actions.  Heinlein creates a universe where a human society has advanced significantly, to the point where war within the species is unheard of, but is founded on very different principles, which are very alien to me.  This makes character Rico much more sympathetic, because it allows him to have relatable priorities, such as racial equality, civil order, personal freedom, etc.  The only difference is that his ideology, which promotes these ideals, also leads to the notion that military is an integral part of a functional society.  What I found so disturbing in this book was that this ideology, which was contrary to many of my beliefs in a lot of ways, was very self-consistent, and logical in its formulation.&lt;br /&gt;
	The philosophy of people in the world of Starship Troopers is that force is a necessary part of maintaining order, and that order, aside from being a benefit in itself, yields prosperity.  On the simplest level, humanity embraces the use of force on a personal level.  Not only is the use of a spanking paddle common in homes and in school for the purpose of behavioral modification, but also, laws are enforced by public whippings.  I describe this as &quot;behavioral modification&quot;, because it is apparent that the society&#039;s notion of how to maintain order stems from the basic principles in potty-training a puppy.  In Professor Dubois&#039; lecture about the failures of the total democracies (our society), he asks Rico about how to train a puppy not to pee in the house, and Rico responds automatically that, &quot;You scold him so that he knows he&#039;s in trouble, you rub his nose in it so that he will know what trouble you mean, you paddle him so that he darn well won&#039;t do it again.&quot; (114)  Clearly, Rico is conditioned to think that physical force is necessary for changing an individual&#039;s undesirable behavior.  However, the idea of behavioral modification through force extends past the notion of the individual to modifying the behavior of a collective.  In a separate lecture by Professor Dubois,  a student presents the idea that violence solves nothing, but he retorts that &quot;Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor,&quot; citing the fact that an entire civilization&#039;s fate was determined when Roman armies destroyed Carthage. (26)  From this, the primacy of the military and Mobil Infantry becomes apparent.  According to the accepted thinking in this book, to maintain order, it is sometimes necessary to modify the behavior groups of people, or foreign nations, which disrupt order.  The optimal way to do this is to use controlled force, in order to compel a change in behavior.  Effectively, a paddle is to a pup as the Mobil Infantry is to uncooperative nations.&lt;br /&gt;
	The view that physical force is such an important part of civil society isn&#039;t a disturbing notion in itself, as cultures have espoused it before.  What is most unsettling is the justification is so well conceived.  A large part of the argument stems from the acknowledgement that humans, as well as most species, have evolved with an instinct for survival.  Any threat to survival should compel that species to adapt its behavior to limit that threat.  The philosophy of the future is that any good citizen is motivated by the same thing that a heinous criminal is.  Professor Dubois describes morality as &quot;an elaboration of the instinct to survive.&quot; (118)  What he means by this, is that moral code, and other socially beneficial qualities, aren&#039;t an inherent quality of man, but have been instilled in him by the society by appealing to his desire so survive.  Unlike, today, in the future, morality is seen as a scientifically justifiable construct.&lt;br /&gt;
	As a believer in evolution and science, these arguments are almost convincing.  However, the book reveals a weakness in this view of an effective society.  It claims that running a society is a matter of scientific analysis and proof, however, science requires evidence.  When Rico is taking History and Moral Philosophy as a cadet, the professor asks why the system of veterans voting is most effective, stumping his students.  He admits that &quot;the reason for continuing [this] system is the same as the practical reason for continuing anything: It works satisfactorily.&quot; (181)  However, this applies to more than just voting.  It applies to the entire system of government in this futuristic world.  The book claims that this method is most effective by science of empirical evidence, however, as a reader, I have no real evidence that such a system should work, and for that reason, I am no longer presented with a moral dilemma. â˜º&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The only thing to do with a &#039;cult favorite&#039;: SEQUEL!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/30</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Because in Hollywood-speak, &#039;a horrible movie&#039; is called a &#039;cult favorite&#039; and sequels rule the universe, Sony Pictures in 2004 put out &#039;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation&#039;, a &#039;rapid-fire sequel to the cult favorite, [in which] the Federation&#039;s best Mobile Infantry unit goes back into action against the Bug horde.&#039;  A straight-to-DVD masterpiece!&lt;br /&gt;
And, according to imdb, they&#039;re making a THIRD one starring the original Johnny.  Really?  Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad photoshopped poster is worth a visit.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>First Response!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/29</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So here it is, my very first reading response for my very first lit class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was reading Starship Troopers over the weekend, I found that I was rather surprised with the parallels between the Bugs and the people of the Terran Federation. There seemed to be this common need to put the needs of the group in general before the needs of the individual. This in turn, I found a bit strange because I was under the impression that Heinlein was opposed to communism which is almost what he was advocating. Anyway, there were two parallels in particular that caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first parallel has to do with citizenship. To earn it, a person has to put in their two or more years of federal service, in the military or otherwise, and only then are they entitled to vote. According to Colonel Dubois, &quot;citizenship isâ€¦an emotional conviction that the whole is greater than the part&quot; (163).  Rather than the importance of the individual within society, it is the society, or at least a larger group than just the individual, that matters. This is, apparently, even mathematically provable according to Juan&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy class. &quot;All correctâ€¦ moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level -- as in a father who dies to save his children&quot; he says (185). The greater good being more important than that of the individual seems to be true of the Bugs as well, although they don&#039;t ever question these actions. Certain castes are simply destined to carryout whatever actions they are delegated. They are, in essence, programmed to die so that their race can survive. Interestingly, in both instances the behavior stems from instinct despite the two races being quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also leads me to think about the instance in which Juan determines that it is worth going to war to save just one man. This seems to counter the previous belief as here a greater group is worth sacrificing just to save one man who &quot;may not deserve it â€¦ [or] may die in the meantime&quot; because &quot;thousands of people get killed every day in accidents&quot; (178).  I suppose this has to do with the military belief that no man should be left behind, but the fact that it opposes what has been established as human instinct strikes me as rather interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second comparison between MIs and Bug society is to do with the hierarchy established by each. It almost seems at times that the ideal MIs structure is close to that of the Bugs. The people at the bottom have their orders and are expected to carry them out, if not, they run the chance of suffering the same fate as the Third Lieutenant who fought in the Napoleonic Wars, who &quot;was tried for `deserting his post of duty as commanding officer in the presence of the enemy.&#039; Convicted. Cashiered&quot; even though he had been trying to save his commanding officer (194).  The worker Bugs on the other hand are &quot;hardly more than animate machinery&quot; and cannot disobey and warriors are &quot;are almost as stupid without a director as workers&quot; (194). What the MIs strive for is what the Bugs are born with although both have an instinct to place the needs of many above the needs of few.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/28</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not really like Starship Troopers. It was a quick read and I thought the descriptions of the technology used and of the action were interesting, but ultimately the novel just felt like a piece of propaganda to me. The military is very glamorized and Heinlein&#039;s own political views are beat into the reader throughout the story. Both of these aspects of the story brought down the novel for me, as Starship Troopers seems like a call to action for people to either support or join the military and perform the noblest action of all, which is to put one&#039;s life at stake for one&#039;s country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that made Starship Troopers feel like propaganda is how much the Mobile Infantry is praised. It is depicted as an extremely effective and efficient branch of the military that does a lot of the dirty work for the homeland, a group that gets the job done and takes action when needed. One of the most prominent aspects of the Mobile Infantry is its sense of brotherhood. Various outfits of the Mobile Infantry, such as Rasczak&#039;s Roughnecks, are described as being as close as family. Everything seems to run smoothly, as all the soldiers work and fight together in harmony. The Mobile Infantry accomplishes all of this by never leaving any person behind on missions. Whenever possible, all soldiers make it their life&#039;s duty to retrieve wounded soldiers who have fallen behind. All of this combines to paint a very majestic picture of the Mobile Infantry, and really of the military in general. This is what I meant when I stated previously that Heinlein glamorizes the military. Admittedly, Heinlein does not characterize the Mobile Infantry as perfect. Portions of the book are devoted to describing the arduous training required to join the Mobile Infantry, including injuries and deaths resulting from the training. However, this in a way acts to further glamorize the military. The final message regarding the Mobile Infantry seems to be that every person has paid his or her dues to get in, and once a person is in, he or she is family and from that point on acts as the epitome of a citizen by putting his or her life at stake to protect the homeland. It just seems too perfect to me. Somebody mentioned in class that Starship Troopers is required reading for most of the military academies in the United States, and I can see the reasoning behind it. Soldiers are put on a pedestal in this novel and idolized. Late in the story, even Rico&#039;s father, who was completely opposed to the military, joins the Mobile Infantry because he feels that it will make his life more fulfilling. This surprise event just made Starship Troopers feel even more like a piece of propaganda, since in the end, even the most vehement opponent of the military has a change of heart and joins because it is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship Troopers just seems to be an excuse for Heinlein to spread his political views; the story exists to solely to link together the various classroom discussion sections, which is the other major aspect of the story that brought it down for me. I understand that novels are constantly used as vehicles for authors to express their philosophical and political musings - I do not object to this if the commentary is implemented well. The problem I have with Starship Troopers is that Heinlein comes off as very self-righteous to me. As I progressed through the novel, Heinlein&#039;s commentary became more and more obnoxious. He uses Dubois to express his views and he presents them as fact. Dubois is seen as this omniscient, infallible character who is always right, and it is this character who presents much of Heinlein&#039;s views. Any time the story switched to a Dubois lecture, I felt like the situation changed to where Heinlein is directly lecturing the reader about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Women in Starship Troopers - A More Well-Supported Argument</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/27</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is a little more formal than what others have been posting, but here it is anyway. It&#039;s somewhat an expansion of the comment I made earlier, with some more points and some textual support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a surface reading, it appears that women are a respected group in Starship Troopers. Rico repeatedly speaks of the intelligence of his friend Carmencita (27, among others), and he admires the prowess of the pilots that fly him into battle (9). However, when it comes down to it, there is little place for strength and honor among women in his world. In fact, Rico&#039;s attitude towards women is indicative of the systematic lack of respect that his society accords women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico has two key close interactions with women of his own age in the book, both with Carmencita Ibanez. In the first, he is surprised when Carmencita tells him she wants to sign up for Federal service, since &quot;little Carmen was so ornamental that you just never thought about her being useful&quot; (26). It is hard to overstate how well this describes Rico&#039;s attitude toward women, whether they be his peers or his superiors. Though they may have key roles, Rico never considers them to have any kind of fundamentally important role in the workings of the universe. In fact, when Carmen gains some responsibility, Rico begins to respect her, but only insofar as she gains what he considers to be masculine qualities â€“ he finally sees her as an &quot;officer and a fighting man â€“ as well as a very pretty girl&quot; (139). In Rico&#039;s eyes, a warrior must be male, and if Carmen has these qualities, they must be separate from her femininity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the pilots in Starship Troopers seem to be a counter-example to this prejudice. Though every single soldier in the M.I. is male, the navy pilots are invariably female, and play a vital role in getting the soldiers to the ground safely. They are well-loved by the men whose lives are in their hands, and they hold absolute authority over their ship. But really, how respected are they? They are at most mid-ranking officers, who control their ship and perform a specific duty. In their capacity as troop transport drivers, they simply take the soldiers from one place to another, and never participate actively in the battle. As captains of navy warships, as mentioned in the book, they stand off at a distance and pound bug planets into oblivion. They are never present in the grit of the battlefield, and thus have no way to gain honor and respect in the eyes of the army men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one non-pilot female mentioned in the book, aside from Rico&#039;s mother, is actually smarter and more on top of things than her superior, and yet explicitly cut out of the chain of command. This is Miss Kendrick, the secretary to Rico&#039;s instructor Colonel Nielssen at the Officer academy. Colonel Nielssen admits that he signs &quot;anything, if Miss Kendrick has initialed it,&quot; and yet if he were to die, she would &quot;not do a blessed thingâ€¦because she is not in the line of command and has no authority&quot; (150). By all rights, Miss Kendrick should be the one making commands, but she is a woman, and thus is not able to gain the respect she needs to make such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, no woman in Starship troopers would be able to reach a seriously high level in the military. In order to become a general, and command the overall structure, a soldier has to work his way up through both the navy and the army. Conceivably, a woman could work her way up through the navy, but there is not a single woman in the army, so she could never gain the highest position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the number of women involved in the military, it seems that this power disparity would continue when the women returned from federal service. Rico&#039;s society is strictly militaristic, and the most respected roles are those of the military. It follows that the most respected individuals in the Federal government are those that participate at a high level in military service. In comparison to the size of the army, the navy is very small, in terms of man-power, and not all of the people in the navy are women. As such, the number of male respected citizens would far outweigh the number that are female, and so the women will likely have as little say in the non-military aspects of governance as they do in the military sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final effect of the societal disregard for women firmly marginalizes them in the Starship Troopers universe. They are respected in some small sense, but nevertheless are systematically left out of any important, guiding, decision-making capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WTF, Paul Verhoeven.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/26</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently 4 minutes and 15 seconds into the movie Starship troopers, and I am absolutely sure that is has the worst opening sequence I have ever witnessed.  Perhaps it is because I just recently saw Cloverfield, which went a little too far down the documentary/shaky-cam road, but the little sequence &#039;on the battlefield&#039; was RIDICULOUS.  Let&#039;s even put aside the fact that a trained soldier continues to talk to the camera even though a Bug has (not sneakily at all) come around the corner and is about to snatch the soldier up in his semi-CGI, animatronic-looking maw.  Let&#039;s put aside the fact that the soldier takes time to shout over the sound of gunfire and comment, in melodramatic terms, on the aesthetics of the planet he&#039;s landed on.  We are evidently supposed to believe that the camera is being held by someone on the news crew, unarmed.  SO WHAT IS HE DOING??  The Bug comes roaring around a rock and bites a few soldiers in half, and he just stands there, evidently intelligent enough to aim the camera into the action but not intelligent enough to remove himself to a safer location (namely not one within arm&#039;s-length of the Bug).  He also has the steadiest hand I have ever seen, capable of smoothly swinging from Bug to shouting soldiers and back again.  He can apparently do this even while running; perhaps this is why he appears to be moving no faster than a brisk trot.  Once this faceless, brainless camera man has been put out of his misery by the Bug, his camera falls to the ground, allowing Rico to crawl toward it, his blindingly white teeth clenched prettily in pain and his eyes still open slightly, as if he is checking to make sure that he is still in frame so his bravery can be appropriately documented.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that came out more like a rant than I intended.  I apologize.  Please look to &#039;to whitewash or not to whitewash&#039; for a more measured and rational example of my response to Starship Troopers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Choice: Always a Hot Issue</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/25</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many things we discussed in class, there was one topic that intrigued me the most--perhaps because it was only briefly touched upon. Someone mentioned the apparent paradox that the enemy Bug society is pure communism and yet the human society considers that system ideal. Certainly it is intriguing that the M.I. are fighting against a system they have bought into. Consider the fact that people are only &quot;legal residents&quot; until they have served at least two years in the Federal Service, following their government&#039;s plans and putting the good of the nation before personal gain and safety. Only when they have overcome their individualism can they be a true citizen and thus gain the right to vote. The simple idea behind this is, of course, communism; each part must work to better the whole. Their society rewards the choice to follow communist ideals because they well know that communism makes a nation amazingly strong when it must fight. Of course, this is why it is so difficult to defeat the purely communist Bugs. The question is, if the human society considers communism ideal, what differentiates them from the Bugs? Are they not just as bad (or good, as the subjective analysis may read)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the difference is the choice, the completely voluntary decision to join the Federal Service. I say interestingly because choice is an individualistic ideal, while giving an affirmative to the choice presented will result in a dissolution of the self into simply a part of the whole. At the same time, this paradoxical nature of the choice maintains the importance of the individual, an idea that has always been valued in American culture and the belief that differentiates the humans from the Bugs. Indeed, the humans&#039; government as a whole appears rather human itself; it understands that the best option is to have a communist system when it comes to fighting a war, but at the same time, it wants its people to realize this on their own because they will make stronger, more passionate fighters. As humans, we naturally want something much more if we have chosen it (or believe the illusion that we have) than if we have been forced upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one question, however. Is the choice truly voluntary? It appears to be so, but the society definitely pushes its residents toward the &quot;right decision.&quot; Veterans can vote, usually hold better jobs, and appear to live more fulfilling lives. Also, at least in Juan&#039;s case, the conviction to join seems only to grow when authority figures question the certainty of the decision. Undoubtedly, there is at least a subconscious push toward joining the Federal Service. Perhaps that is why, as I believe Mr. Dubois mentions, there are too many unskilled or militarily incompetent people for whom random jobs must be created.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bugs in Starship Troopers as Nature, not Race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that it&#039;s a common trope in science fiction for ideas about divisions of race to be transplanted to racial boundaries â€“ as if the authors are saying, &quot;Look, if they can get along with wookies, why can&#039;t we humans all get along among ourselves?&quot; It&#039;s such a common device, in fact, that it becomes difficult to recognize when alien species are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent ethnicities. However, the Bugs from &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; may actually be something different â€“ for lack of a better term, I&#039;ll describe their presence as a force of Nature, not Race (with a capital R) in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the relationship between the humans of the Terran Federation and the Bugs doesn&#039;t resemble racial conflict â€“ the only interactions between the two are acts of destruction. Historically, racial conflict doesn&#039;t take the form of immediate, all-out war: the Europeans and American Indians were able to participate in trade and exchange of ideas before prejudice and hatred built up to cause the two sides to begin fighting each other; trade in slaves from Africa was facilitated at least by the cooperation of some leaders within that continent; even the American Civil War was not fought as a battle of &quot;black versus white&quot; at all. However, in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;, the two sides are not just completely at odds with each other militarily: the Terran Federation &quot;[understands] [the Bugs] as little as [it] [understands] termites&quot; (222). The Terran Federation doesn&#039;t even have the faintest idea what the Bugs&#039; motivation is for fighting or when it might be possible to declare peace â€“ they don&#039;t even really know how bugs live, other than the very basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bugs and the humans appears most obviously in Johnny&#039;s proof about war as a cause of population pressure: &quot;Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us outâ€“because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate&quot; (186). This begins to resemble the conflict between American Indians and Europeans, but in the case of the American Indians, as members of the same species, they ended up becoming somewhat mixed in with the European population that invaded â€“ no such thing is possible (as far as we can see) with the Bugs. The conflict is meant to be seen in a similar situation as that of the &quot;retarded&quot; wildlife of Sanctuary - &quot;When types that had evolved on a planet enjoying high radiation and fierce competition were introduced, the native stuff was outclassed&quot; (155). The humans and the Bugs in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t communicate, they don&#039;t intermarry and they certainly don&#039;t hold Thanksgiving dinners together before killing each other: they&#039;re opposing species from different environments, and when they come into conflict, it&#039;s kill or be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Responses to class discussions</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/23</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone in class on Monday had mentioned that in the MI, humans are the (vessel for) technology.  I think this is an interesting point, especially in conjunction with the developments of our current military.  The United States Army has been implementing robots in the Middle East to prevent unnecessary casualties.  Soldiers can now direct these robots, which can detect and disable mines and have the capability of firing back at any hostiles, with remote controls from a safe distance away.  There remains that element of human judgment, although in a much more diluted form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I had contemplated applying to West Point or joining RoTC; as for the use of this book by the various military academies in the United States, which was brought up in class, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scary thing.  Starship Troopers stresses loyalty to the government and to protection of the general population, as well as the concept of &quot;leave no man behind.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this book justifies violence in a way that makes sense (I&#039;m not saying I advocate it) and would mitigate the dissent of people who are against American troops in Iraq (namely those who harass soldiers or marines about &quot;supporting the war&quot;).  I pulled this particular quote because it reminded me of another quote (Was it Alfred Lord Tennyson who wrote &quot;Ours is not to reason why.  Ours is but to do or die.&quot;?): &quot;The purpose of war is to support your government&#039;s decisions by force...Not killing..but controlled and purposeful violence.  But it&#039;s not your business or mine to decide the purpose of the control.  It&#039;s never a soldier&#039;s business to decide when or where or how--or why--he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals...&quot; (63).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had watched the movie long before ever reading this book and I can remember my initial thoughts: Wow this movie must have been a low budget film.  After reading ST and re-watching the adaptation, I also noted that: 1]It&#039;s strange that most of the characters look/are white, but have retained their more &quot;ethnic&quot; names 2]Dizzy Flores is a female and 3]Women are allowed in the MI for the sake of gratuitous female nudity...?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Might Makes Right in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/22</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To continue a discussion begun in class today, what is the function of violence in Starship Troopers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note:&lt;br /&gt;
-Suffrage was available only to those who completed their 2(+) years of voluntary service.&lt;br /&gt;
-Those who wish to serve a term of service can participate in non-overtly-violent ways (as terraformers, technicians, logistics, and human guinea pigs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is violence the only way to gain merit in this society?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, we only see through the narrator&#039;s perspective, who quickly learns that &quot;The Mobile Infantry is the Army. All the others are either button pushers or professors, along merely to hand us the saw; we do the dirty work&quot; (p. 39). His account of transformation throughout boot camp resounds with descriptions of physical labor; along the way characters settle a multitude of  power struggles with hand-to-hand combat (e.g. introduction of sergeant Zim, the showerroom scene with Ace). Juan earns real respect only after his first drop, and his father&#039;s love is only clear when his father risks his own life as a member of the MI. Again and again it&#039;s the willingness to engage in violence (interestingly, success doesn&#039;t seem to matter as much) that &#039;separates the men from the boys.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this story sticks close to its moral that a man earns respect by demonstrating &quot;through voluntary and difficult service that he places the welfare of the group ahead of personal advantage&quot; (p. 182).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Test, and first response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/20</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whew, meant to do this earlier.  Well in any case, I don&#039;t read a whole lot of science fiction, but I thought ST was very interesting.  I agree that woman were placed on pedestals as something to fight for, but I did not get the feeling that they were any less important or empowered than the men were.  With all of the power, and yes danger included in the position of being a ship&#039;s captain, the woman captain have their fair share of the cake.  I think however that the purpose behind having the woman aboard did go beyond their abilities as pilots.  I remember a passage where Juan spoke of how the last voice an MI heard before the drop was the female captain starting the drop sequence.  This is somewhat akin to a mother&#039;s voice to her protected child, comforting them before sending them into a hostile world, and would be deeply comforting on some very basic, instinctual levels.  Perhaps then the woman serve not only as objects to admire, but also as &#039;mother&#039; figures on board, whether or not the MI&#039;s realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So a couple thoughts on Heinlein. First of all, although I agree with the below comment that alien races can imply racial connotations, I think that in this case Heinlein used the communal properties of an insectoid race to demonstrate the potential power of a communist social structure in a species adapted to it--and to show it&#039;s fundamental incompatibility with human drives. Second, I think Heinlein&#039;s discussion of the source of political power, though not directly involving race or gender as a major factor, is a potentially useful tool for understanding modern political power relations.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>How to Build a Universe That Doesn&#039;t Fall Apart Two Days Later</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/18</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a great essay by Philip K. Dick (an excellent and important writer whom our reading list kind of grazes) about the purpose and meaning to be found in science fiction. He doesn&#039;t directly tackle issues of race and gender, but his interpretations of the purpose of science fiction are fascinating and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting subjects touched on in this essay: Disneyland and &quot;fake fakes&quot;, universes that DO fall apart, and poor translations of his novels. The main thrust of his argument is that science fiction is passed off as patently, unabashedly spurious, and yet there&#039;s some parallel way in which many of the things in science fiction are true - sometimes in ways the author could never have predicted. In some ways, he sees a more complex picture than the idea of science fiction as thinly-veiled political writing, which we&#039;ve already covered as the blanket interpretation of the genre. Though, honestly, as the essay progresses, it becomes more and more clear what a disturbed person Philip K. Dick is, but his persistent wit makes it worth checking out anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://deoxy.org/pkd_how2build.htm&quot;&gt;How to Build a Universe That Doesn&#039;t Fall Apart Two Days Later&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;ll probably take you less than an hour and it&#039;s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Reading Suvin 36 years later</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/17</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of Suvin&#039;s main defining points of the SF genre in his 1972 essay &quot;On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre&quot; is &quot;[t]he world of a work of SF is not a priori intentionally oriented toward its protagonists, either positively or negatively; the protagonists may succeed or fail in their objectives, but nothing in the basic contract with the reader, in the physical laws of their worlds, guarantees either&quot; (378).  While I realize Suvin isn&#039;t speaking to the sci fi tv shows of his day or that would follow, I wonder how his definition translates to a storyline with multiple installments.  I suppose this works with written stories as well, though you don&#039;t have the added element of &quot;that actor&#039;s contract isn&#039;t up yet, he&#039;ll make it through at least the end of the season&quot; with the written story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you could argue that Suvin assumes a certain immersion in the world, ignoring things like &quot;the book still has another hundred pages), but I feel a totally accepting immersion counteracts the cognitive estrangement and the bit about sci f that forces the reader/viewer to think.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is entirely possible that I am trying to take his argument to a far too literal level.  Part of it might also be that I can&#039;t think of any SF work where the protagonists decidedly fail--I feel like everything I&#039;ve read or seen has some element of victory and/or promise of hope, however bleak it may be.  Feel free to tell me I&#039;ve been reading all the wrong stories and/or am looking to pick an argument where there isn&#039;t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also get the feeling that we&#039;re reading this bit of theory at the beginning of class because, as we progress, the stories will deviate farther and farther from this definition...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 1</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/15</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to preface this response paper by saying that I am not a science fiction reader.  With the exception of Handmaid&#039;s Tale, which I read purely on the basis of its being by Atwood, I have never even heard of any of the books on the syllabus.  However, I am an English major, and I thought it downright prejudiced of me to discount an entire genre without even giving it a chance.  That being said, I loved Starship Troopers.  It wasn&#039;t a particularly great book--I found myself wincing at the dialogue, for example--but it was, in the words of a very wise friend of mine, &quot;like reading an action movie.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fortunately, I feel as though there is much more to the book version of Starship Troopers than the horrific action movie that came of it.  For a while, I toyed with the concept of the Bugs as other races, reduced to nothing more than mindless, vicious killers.  However, I think that this impression doesn&#039;t give Heinlein enough credit.  To me, the bugs seemed simply too primitive to be another race, and their creation of separate classes made them more of an anti-caste statement than a racial slur. Rico&#039;s volatile hatred of them: &quot;those Bugs make me queasy&quot; made me think of them as nothing more elaborate than another species (13).  In addition to his own personal hatred of the creatures, they are constantly going on &quot;bug hunts,&quot; a term that reduces them firmly to animal level. Although it is possible that I am simply too naÃ¯ve to think of anyone as hating another race so much that they could happily &quot;[smack] down any Bugs that showed their ugly heads&quot; (225), it seems that, at least to Rico, the Bugs are nothing more than animals.  Heinlein&#039;s book seems, if anything, attempting to disregard the importance of race entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the more subtle cues to this racial oblivion comes in the character of the father.  At the beginning of the novel, Rico&#039;s father comes off as the most closed-minded character, absolutely adamant against the idea of his son joining the forces.  He was, to me, the least admirable character, and he did not like other races.  Rico&#039;s father sees Mr. Dubois as a catalyst for his son&#039;s entry into the army.  When he hears Dubois&#039;s name, he instantly retorts with, &quot;â€¦a silly name--it suits him.  Foreigner, no doubt&quot; (23).  This comment serves to accentuate the father&#039;s close-mindedness and also caused me to second-guess my theory of the Bugs as a vilified other race.  If Heinlein had xenophobic leanings, why would he not put them into the mouth of a more sympathetic character?&lt;br /&gt;
Another hint came surprisingly late--the racial identity of the central character.  Only on page 260, when I discovered that Rico&#039;s native language was Tagalong, did I realize that he was Filipino.  Obviously, I realized that he was not White (simply because of his last name), but I had no idea that he was Filipino until that line.  This realization means that Heinlein chose to cast a non-White character as the hero of his novel.  In addition to Rico, his &quot;love interest&quot; is also obviously non-White.  With a name like Carmencita Ibanez, she seems intentionally blatantly foreign.&lt;br /&gt;
In general, the issues of race don&#039;t seem overly important to Heinlein.  He obviously didn&#039;t feel like the main character&#039;s heritage was very important, and his characters were, in general, unconcerned with race.  He even says that his world&#039;s democracy is one &quot;unlimited by race [or] color&quot; (183). However, I was shocked to realize the connection that Heinlein made between their egg-laying and the Chinese population: &quot;â€¦the Bug commissars didn&#039;t care any more about expending soldiers than we cared about expending ammo.  Perhaps we could have figured this out about the Bugs by noting the grief the Chinese Hegemony gave the Russo-Anglo-American Alliance&quot; (153).  In all honesty, I was not sure what to make of this comment.  It seemed subtly tossed in, but it really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I think that this was more a statement about fears of over-population and the expendability of the human race.  The Army is an organization that relishes the idea of abandoning individuality, and I think that Heinlein, despite his military pride, was warning his readers against this very concept.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hello!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/13</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to be up and running smoothly, sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in some type of &#039;science fiction inventory&#039; -- an assessment of what a particular person is drawing on when they talk about the genre as they know it. Personally, my mother often bragged about watching Star Wars with me while I was in the womb and we had a fair amount of Star Trek (both OS and TNG). As I grew up, mobs of Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figures lived (and did battle) side by side in a miniature plywood house we made. My brother and I saved our allowance money for X-Men and Star Wars cards, again often playing games or setting up scenes in which to role-play them duking it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the actual literary side of science fiction played a much smaller role in determining these interests. We had a lot of Fantasy books for bedtime stories (Redwall, anyone?) and I loved &quot;I, Robot&quot; and the Star Wars Rogue Squadron sort of stuff, but I think it&#039;s fair to say that by the time I was a serious reader at all, I dismissed most sci-fi as fluff (&quot;Ender&#039;s Game&quot; was the closest I got to rediscovering the genre, but even that felt like a guilty pleasure by the time I was reading it late in high school). At the same time, we watched Voyager every week as a family (shameful, I know) and it was definitely more from movies/video games that I really learned about &#039;science fiction.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found such books exciting (I thought about Le Guin&#039;s &quot;the ones who walk away from Omelas&quot; for years after reading it in 6th grade and I loved &quot;Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot; in high school), but didn&#039;t really read that much on my own. Maybe it was because I fell into the trap of not doing much reading for fun. Particularly because, when I did, it was the equivalent of educational baby-food -- Harry Potter and the like. In the reading of &quot;canonical&quot; fiction and other coursework, I somehow forgot that there could be *good* science fiction that was stimulating on more than a surface level (I just read &quot;Foundation&quot; finally over winter break and it was a major reason to want to take this course).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What did the bugs represent to you?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/12</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was reading this book it occurred to me that the the &quot;bugs&quot; that the humans are fighting could potentially represent some different themes.  The ones that I could quickly come up with are: (1) there were some obvious communist references to the bugs&#039; way of life and getting rid of the &quot;bugs&quot; or commies might be something Heinlein is trying to say.  Considering the book was written in 1959 I think this could make sense. (2) As was briefly mentioned in class on Wednesday, when inter-species extermination is involved, racial purification might be implied.  Especially since the humans were portrayed as better than the bugs. (3) I&#039;m more inclined to believe that it doesn&#039;t really matter.  Heinlein needed some type of enemy so that he had a forum to lay out his political beliefs.  Much to my surprise (and disappointment) this book did not really contain that much action (unlike the movie) and to me it felt like this book was more of a political statement (i.e. pro military, kind of fascist etc...) than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Those were the main ones I could come up with and I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas/thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Test, and some thoughts.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/11</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;DOES THIS WORK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidding.  I just finished Starship Troopers, and was favorably impressed compared to the movie.  All I had remembered from the movie was a basic action movie set in space.  The book was clearly far deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, there seems to be a large amount of race and gender interplay in Starship Troopers.  Females being better pilots stood out from the beginning, and then there were numerous references to women as part of the reason why the M. I. fought.  Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come later?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>a few reminders</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/2</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t forget to create your account here, and once I&#039;ve approved it, make sure you post something (anything) before class on Monday, just to make sure everything&#039;s working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: you&#039;ll notice that our links block in the sidebar is pretty slight -- let me know if you have sites that I should add links to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:  the thing that I was trying to remember in class today, that I had wanted to say but had temporarily forgotten, was my spoiler caveat.  In previous semesters, I divided the reading fairly strictly by day, and worked pretty hard to keep spoilers out of the classroom, so that those who read more quickly wouldn&#039;t give things away to the rest of the class.  This semester, as an experiment, I&#039;m saying the heck with that: we&#039;re going to talk about the entire novel, more or less, from the get-go, focusing on different issues rather than different sections on each of the days we discuss it.  Which means that there will be spoilers galore, so if you care about such things, try to make sure you&#039;ve finished the novel before the first day we discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you Monday...&lt;/p&gt;
