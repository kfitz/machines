 <title>New plateau of advertising?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/213</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;An updated adage for the post-political age: Ask not what your commodity can do for you, but what you can do for your commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEw1rsBUak&quot; title=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEw1rsBUak&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkEw1rsBUak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this car, the commodity-consumer relationship has entirely inverted. It is no longer the commodity that provides for me; rather, the commodity-object requires that I provide for it. Of course, the tit-for-tat  contractuality of bourgeois social relations remains in tact (you please the car, and it will please you), but the point stands: the onus lies, fundamentally, with the consumer to &quot;make the first move,&quot; as it were. Will I ever be able to take it to enough high-end stores and dinner parties to please it? Or, maybe it&#039;s sheer lust. Maybe all I have to do is perform well -- but which combination of gas-peddle manipulations would comprise good performance? Yet it&#039;s precisely this tension that sells the product. Here, we have the fetishistic gap between flesh-and-blood materiality and symbolic overcoding taken to new, absurd extremes&quot;: Who knows just how the car might please you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyborgian aspects of this ad seem germane to various course themes. It&#039;s notable, to begin with, that Cadillac decided to gender the prototypic consumer-subject of this car feminine rather than masculine, since -- assuming heteronormative standards of advertising  (more than a safe assumption, I think, given the source) -- this implicitly genders the car masculine. Although this gender scheme might feel intuitively felicitious (after all, aren&#039;t cars usually depicted as hyper-maculine power incarnate?), it actually runs contrary to the majority of such advertisements, which, insofar as they represent a sexualized bond between car and driver, tend to relegate the machine to a feminine position in which material passivity is coupled with libidinal activity -- a position of docile desire, the embodied occupant of which is mechanized and metalized. I would hardly be the first to suggest that this epitomizes male fantasy -- not so much pure sexual desire, but the more important, meta-level desire to surmount feminine desire, that impossible object-thing par excellence. On this reading, figures like Molly from Neuromancer literalize male fantasy: a cyborgified female subject whose desire has become -- like all machines -- codifiable and traversable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does it mean to invert the gender matrix, to have the female subject be the one in control, attemping to surmount the mystery of masculinized desire? Perhaps it relates to what Zizek calls &quot;interpassivity&quot; -- the inverse of interactivity (in which I get enjoyment from somebody else pursuing an activity in my place [e.g., when James Bond takes out the bad guy and gets the girl]). In an interpassive dynamic, I get enjoyment from someone else being passive in my place, the most immediately relevant example of which is probably canned laughter on sitcoms, which effectively make it unnecessary for me to even laugh at the &quot;humorous&quot; show I&#039;m watching -- there&#039;s already somebody laughing at it for me. Could we read an interpassive dynamic into the Cadillac scenario as well? What a relief: I&lt;br /&gt;
(the male viewer-subject) don&#039;t have to enjoy being serviced, since the car effectively fills that symbolic burden for me. And furthermore, I don&#039;t have to come to terms with the trauma of masochistic fantasy -- I can keep performing masculinity in the same way, business-as-usual, never having to question the reproduction of patriarchal conditions...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Disgruntled technocrats</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/210</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two Oxford sociologists recently published a study concluding that engineers are more disposed than other professional demographic to join militant political groups (or, neocon parlance, &quot;terrorist groups&quot;). The finding itself--the empirical fact that rank-and-file terrorists are demonstrably likely to come from an engineering background of some kind--is less interesting than the analysis offered by the researchers to explain it (away). They express legitimate bafflement that members of the professional-technocratic class would come to oppose, much less militantly oppose, a global capitalism from which they directly benefit. Underlying this bafflement, however, is deeper incredulity: the researchers are clearly amazed--and why shouldn&#039;t they be, in this age of neoliberalism?--that members of the professional-technocratic class would become politicized at all. Indeed, when the researchers explicitly assimilate terrorism to &quot;right-wing politics&quot; (citing, as their analytical justification, the tendency of Rightism to reduce complex problems down to unwavering, univocal solutions), they are effectively claiming that politics is itself an inherently right-wing impulse--for what is a properly &quot;political&quot; act in our post-political age, if not an intervention that eshews &quot;live and let live&quot; ideologies outright, and instead takes an unwavering (to the point of downright &quot;unreasonable&quot;) stance? In this sense, &quot;politics&quot; (right-wing or otherwise) stands in direct opposition to the reproduction of technocratic power, which seems hell-bent on purging us of any inclination to take an unwavering, principled stance on just about anything. The most disastrous moment imaginable for neoliberal hegemony is when people--of whatever class or occupation--begin to mount viable opposition to the flexible, self-revolutionizing logic of Capital. Perhaps this offers some insight into the real threat of engineer-terrorists (that is, beyond the usual, banal anxieties of political militancy [They could harm innocent civilians! and the like] spoon-fed to us by mainstream media): they are the disgruntled by-product of a regime of technocratic power that seeks to erase disgruntlement altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with science fiction? Well, lots--at least to the extent that science-fictional visions of society attempt to understand the (usually rather horrific) results of down-to-earth, democratic humanism being supplanted by impersonal, unwieldy technologies of knowledge production and social control. In Neuromancer, Gibson talked briefly about locales that exist (or more pointedly, are ALLOWED to exist) to facilitate pure innovation--spaces in which the sole organizing principle of social life is Technology itself, that ubiquitous, self-permuting force that one either keeps up with or gets ruthlessly subsumed by. This seems to be a widely deployed trope in sci-fi, particularly those narratives concerned (allegorically) with our impending future. The Terminator films, for instance, envision America reduced to an apocalyptic simulacrum: all that&#039;s left of postmodern society is--what else?--the military-industrial complex, mega-corporations on the cutting age of technological innovation (which is, of course, responsible for the greatest tragedy to befall humanity in the history of the world). But wait: Where are the traditional loci of institutional authority--politicians, police, bureaucrats, etc.? In Freedman&#039;s paper from the beginnng of the course, he talked about the scene, from T2, of Arnold&#039;s aesthetically celebrated manhandling of police officers, in which we bear witness to the ecstatic destruction of human bodies (particularly pathetic human bodies), disturbing because of its obvious contempt for materiality, but also, and furthermore, because it underscores the disquietedly anarchic conditions of the film&#039;s landscape: police (as the emblem of the rule of Law) are no match for the scourge of capitalism and its volatile bedfellow, Technology. Indeed, it&#039;s worth noting that one of the only instances of traditional authority exercising any real power comes in Sarah&#039;s detention in a mental institution during T2. How perfect: the designation and quarantining of &quot;madness&quot;--the merciless intersection of knowledge production and social control.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet is this landscape really so allegorical? The films are by now somewhat dated (Terminator was released in 1984, Terminator 2 in 1991), but conditions of technocrat power, in which social life has acceded to the mandates to an out-of-control military-industrial complex (which arguably includes not only direct defense spending, but also many high-tech firms, the entertainment industry, and even some forms of scholarship [Middle East studies, anyone?]), have only intensified. It is difficult, for instance, to follow the 2008 election without it bringing to mind Terminator-style destruction of the impotent Law. What use is any politician in the face of transnational Capital--especially when all &quot;reasonable&quot; politicians refuse to question the merits of capitalism in the first place. Indeed, when Obama--to take one, rather arbitrary (though not entirely arbitrary, in light of his lovely rhetoric about &quot;hope and &quot;change&quot;) example--talks about returning power to the people, the proper response is, of course, to sigh, and wonder what&#039;s wrong with a nation in which fetishized politician-objects have come to not only replace, but actually occlude, structural analysis. What&#039;s crucial to realize w/r/t electoral politics is the sinister complementariy between larger-than-life promises (&quot;A new era of bi-partisanship&quot; / &quot;A new role for America in the world&quot; / etc.) and the one-part ridiculous, two-parts offensive  pandering stints in which politicians return to the people and try their hand at &quot;real&quot; work (e.g., when John McCain puts on a hard-hat and visits some construction workers, or Hillary Clinton helps out at a daycare [humorous sidenote to my polemic: imagine John McCain helping out at a daycare]). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So vast are the vissicitudes of ideological absurdity here, it&#039;s hard to know where to start. Consider Slavoj Zizek&#039;s remarks on Stalinism, in which he discusses the fundamental impotence at the heart of self-aggrandizing measures (e.g., parades and the like), and ultimately claims that an &quot;implicit acknowledgement of impotence is [actually] the hidden truth of the divinization of the Stalinist Leader into a supreme Genius who can give advice on almost any topic, from how to repair a tractor to how to cultivate flowers: what this Leader&#039;s intervention in everyday life means is that things do not function on the most everyday level--what kind of country is this, in which the supreme Leader himself has to dispense advice about how to repair tractors?&quot; (Zizek, Slavoj. Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism? Verso [New York]: 2002, 120). Could we not ask precisely the same questions about political candidates today? In their pathetic attempts to learn vocational trades and thereby demonstrate &quot;solidarity&quot; for working people--which are, more than anything, reminiscent of young children during Take Your Child To Word Day attempting to &quot;help&quot; their parent with his or her task--do we not have the precise neoliberal equivalent of the Stalinist process that Zizek details above? Although there&#039;s really no hope of reigning in global Capital, which has ceased to play by any rules but its own--which is to say, although politicians really have no idea what the socio-economic future will hold--they can still play idly, as if with toys, with the tools of the working class (or, more sincerely, the tools of working class oppression), and then make sweeping speeches about looking out for American jobs etc. etc. And this time around, it&#039;s even more insidious than with Stalin: instead of the leader dispensing advice to the useless People (as, let&#039;s not forget, an affirmation of that People), it&#039;s the people dispensing advice to the useless Leader--as an affirmation, perversely enough, of that Leader. Of course, the very &quot;ordinariness&quot; of politicians, as represented in spectacles such as these, is precisely what ensures their auratic--one is even tempted to say, &quot;extra-human&quot;--occupation of an ontological-symbolic echelon above that of the layperson; these little moments of (ultimately false, of course) connection between politicians and &quot;real people&quot; that serve to underscore how truly different politicians are from us, which is what leads to ridiculous, at times disturbing, kinds of pathological fixation: Even though I have no idea how to transform health care and fight Evil and do the right thing all around, I&#039;m sure Obama has the answers! (And all I have to do is be audacious!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, of course, nobody will have any legitimate answers until we start having an adult discussion about the constitutive antagonisms of social life, and that would require having an adult discussion about capitalism: how it can only reproduce itself through exploitation, how it relies on concrete violence to maintain &quot;normal conditions,&quot; etc.--which isn&#039;t very pleasant and certainly isn&#039;t in the interest of any individual presidential candidate (or really any institutional authority figure for that matter). Which brings us back to those pesky engineer-terrorists: It&#039;s difficult to understand why they&#039;re upset, especially when they&#039;re basically the only members of the professional elite who are. In fact, in direct contrast to politicians, engineer-terrorists seem to be precisely those institutional authority figures who ARE interested in having an adult discussion about the economic and social effects capitalism--a discussion that always gets nipped pre-emptively in the bud, and thus channeled into acts of obscene, excessive militancy. It&#039;s intriguing, to say the least, that engineers, who more or less personify military-industrial knowledge production, are nevertheless least amenable to the calcification of neoliberal power. In an age marked by cacophonies of technocratic apologia coming from experts whose livelihoods could quite conceivably get trampled by future economic developments (pundits, economists, sociologists, etc.), engineers--the backbone of technocratic society par excellence--display a counterintuitive propensity to dismantle it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Humanity / Non-humanity / Inhumanity (Delany response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/201</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine out of ten theorists agree: Volition, while constitutive of humanity, leads immutably to anxiety (in the &quot;doomed to freedom&quot; sense), from which it follows that the subversion of volition is simultaneously utopian and dystopian in its socio-political impulse; it liberates us from the burden of assuming autonomous subject positions in the world, but in so doing, it undermines the very core of our being. I hardly need to re-iterate for all of you the difficulties of liberal subjectivity--constantly excercising agency in order to make rational choices, taking steps to get closer and closer to one&#039;s authentic, Platonic Self. The opening scene of Stars in Your Pocket Like Grains of Sand affirms these basic coordinates of humanity: to be human signifies the ability, and the material wherewithal, to achieve more than a monosyllabic response (&quot;yes&quot;) to questions like &quot;Do you choose happiness?&quot;--to realize, in fact, being human means contending with the complexities of this question, even when that process requires flouting happiness as such. (This is why Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;last men&quot; are so nightmarish in their self-satisfied willing of manufactured pleasure: their rallying cry, &quot;We invented happiness,&quot; is monstrously hollow, a slogan of pure jouissance, in which lack and excess fuse perversely and endlessly, without meaning, without humanity.) This opening scene is remiscent of another famous opening from the science fiction canon: the gom jobbar test from Frank Herbert&#039;s Dune, in which the protagonist, Paul, undergoes an evaluation of his humanity, during which he is forced to keep his hand in a pain-generator. What solidifes his human stats--a status that most readers generally treat as immutable, which is partly why the scene is so memorable--is his ability to recognize, but nonetheless withstand, the pain. The metaphyscial claim is equivalent: humanity inheres in the very space of contingency in which &quot;autonomy&quot;--but also pain and suffering--articulate themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both narratives potray heterogeneously comprised landscapes in which Earthly humans are, refreshingly enough, eclipsed by other planets and species. By and large, though, humanity still reigns, albeit in allegorical form, such that questions like, &quot;Are those creatures human?&quot; are replaced by more politically meaningful questions like, &quot;Do the &#039;other&#039; species conform to our standards of (nearly always liberal) humanism?&quot; In this sense, the significance of Delaney and Herbert&#039;s respective work basically conforms to the problematic layed out by Freedman in the Reagan/Terminator article with which the course began: Is the political field presented in [text] humanistic or anti-humanistic--and why should we concerned citizens of the real (i.e., non-textual) world care one way or the other? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll confess my own cognitive dissonance at this point: I find the humanism/anti-humanism binary fascinating, but nevertheless politically bankrupt, since any adjudication between humanistic and anti-humanistic politics seems to delimit in advance (and in overwhelmingly liberal terms) what &quot;counts&quot; as politics. (Note: On this point, I diverge from Freedman. Although undeniable differences certainly exist w/r/t their respective modes and tropes of articulation, I would argue that humanism and anti-humanism simply express the internal split of humanism [much like the &quot;pleasure principle&quot; and the &quot;death drive&quot; are not categorically different types of subjectivity, but rather express the internal split of subjectivity itself], and it&#039;s merely an unfortunate linguistic technicality of Freedman&#039;s argument. I have trouble, for instance, when Freedman claims that humanism is present-tense Utopian in its belief that social problems can be solved by human goodwill, whereas anti-humanism is present-tense dystopian in its belief that Evil is not entirely surmountable--could this not be re-read as an expression of ambiguity w/r/t the temporality of Utopian discourse, i.e., the way in which Utopian imaginaries are inherently futural, and for that reason, necessarily ascribe certain dystopian qualities to the present moment?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, I&#039;m drawn to, but also put off by, Freedman&#039;s work--and Delaney&#039;s and Herbert&#039;s--because the need to move beyond humanism, in ways that evade what I&#039;m inclined to label as the *totalitarian* pitfalls of post-Reaganite anti-humanism, seems so clearly necessary. One possibility for critical inquiry in this regard lies in the concept of undeath, which plays on the linguistic ambiguity between &quot;non-human&quot; and &quot;inhuman&quot;--whereas the former simply negates the positive content of &quot;humanity&quot; (e.g., alive, conscious, etc.), the latter supplements &quot;humanity&quot; with an excessive, unsettling quality (the inhuman figure is &quot;more human,&quot; in some sense, than the human him/herself). Could we propose something similar with regard to Freedman&#039;s humanism / anti-humanism distinction? What would it mean to explore the &quot;politics of inhumanity&quot; as an explicit antidote to the obverse complimentarity of humanistic and anti-humanism?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Primacy of Representation?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/121</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To follow up on our &quot;uncontroversial&quot; class discussion yesterday, I wanted to offer some thoughts that will hopefully lead to greater analytical synergy between the two majoritary viewpoints being expressed, namely, a) dominant systems of representation (of which language is one example) are exclusionary insofar as they prohibit the expression of positions (identitarian, political, etc.) that diverge from normative standards, versus b) systems of representations always reflects the proclivities of their agents (e.g., humans who use language) and therefore present deficiencies will necessarily work themselves out--or in its inverse formulation, if present deficiencies don&#039;t work themselves out, then they weren&#039;t even deficiencies in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously these positions don&#039;t seem formally incompatible, which begs the question: What was at stake in the in-class debate? On the whole, the dividing wedge came down to discrepancies apropos of the question of agency--how much control does the individual have over the systems of representations that she uses to express her positionality in the world? How much does the onus to change systems of representation reside with the individuals impacted by their putatively &quot;adverse&quot; effects? The pure libertarian response would be &quot;completely,&quot; whereas the pure social constructivist response would be &quot;not at all.&quot; The polemical stand-off between these two positions can, of course, proceed ad infinitum (indeed, without much to show for it), but I think it&#039;s worthwhile to consider qualitative differences between the distinct modes by which discourses, institutions, and social practices produce our self-reflexive individuality. There is an important difference between 1) social construction that stops individuals from expressing themselves, and 2) social construction that depicts an &quot;illusory&quot; field of social relations in such way as to obscure concrete antagonisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is basically what&#039;s up for grabs in the agency v. social determinism debate, to which, again, it&#039;s hard not to respond with copious yawning. The latter, however, is indispensable for making sense of what it means to excercise one&#039;s agency in the world. One discursive thread from the libertarian side in class yesterday was that culture and sociality define our systems of representations and not vice versa. However, considering that systems of representation inevitably delimit the ways that we conceptualize precisely what constitute &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;sociality,&quot; our ability to discern and grapple critically with concrete antagonisms will be limited at best. How can we claim, for instance, that gender neutral pronouns will &quot;emerge&quot; (by some magically transmutive process, it seems) exactly when gender confusion becomes a socio-cultural issue if no systems of representations are in place to alert people who remain unaffected by gender confusion of its problematic status? In other words, there might be problems, at one level, for gender-queer individuals who want to express their position but can&#039;t find the semiotic tools to do so. Much more acute, however, is the meta-level problem: that without active changes in the language, no semiotic channels exist to facilitate other people&#039;s awareness about the social antagonisms borne out of gender confusion. How can we possibly expect, e.g., English speakers to transform their language in order to reflect concrete antagonisms if the language itself is constantly working to systematically obscure such antagonisms? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final thought: It misses the point of social constructivist criticism to fall back on the &quot;we can never account for all minority positions [so therefore we shouldn&#039;t even try]!&quot; narrative that has become nauseatingly commonplace in discursive backlash against so-called &quot;identity politics&quot; (it&#039;s more than slightly ironic that purveyors of such backlash tend to employ the same &quot;victimizing&quot; language that the purport to despise [e.g., it shouldn&#039;t be the labor of white people to account for EVERY SINGLE minority status imagineable --&amp;gt; white people have become the victims [!]). Destabilized libidinal matrices notwithstanding, I&#039;m sincerely unsure what &quot;threat&quot; this narrative is responding to, since no one&#039;s demanding that EVERY SINGLE minority status become the object of collective sympathy, some brand of social reparations, etc. If normativity and marginality are bound in an inextricable dialectic to one another, then certain positions will always be majoritary and others minoritary. The important point of social constructivist theory is to underscore the ideological arbitrarity of what has come to occupy the center and margin respectively--and in terms of social practice, to continually explore how seemingly &quot;natural&quot; hierarchies are, in fact, arbitrary, and furthermore, how they reinforce socio-historically specific power arrangements. Surely we can keep such a space of interrogation open without it amounting to an insurmountable burden for majoritary subjects. Indeed, it is difficult to see anything beyond the crude and puerile re-inscription of traditional White-hetero-normative domination in chest-pounding arguments to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Utopia and Reasonability (Atwood response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/109</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to further explore two interrelated strands of discussion from last class: on the one hand, the consequences of Atwood&#039;s rendering her dystopia with fidelity to certain internal currents of various socio-political developments in the 1980&#039;s (e.g., Reaganism, porn-burning feminism, the &quot;breakdown&quot; of the East-West Cold War-era binary, etc.); and on the other, the political implications of distinguishing between &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;dogmatic&quot; forms of an ideological system (a distinction which was invoked at least once in an attempt to explain the basis of 1980&#039;s &quot;anti-feminist&quot; backlash [of which Atwood&#039;s text may or may not be an example]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stake in both cases is the question of what to make of the structural gap between the theoretical mandates of a given social order&#039;s foundational and the practical mandates of its &quot;actually existing&quot; manifestation. Can this gap ever be closed, which is to say, can ideology-on-paper and implementation-in-the-world ever overlap fully? Slavoj Zizek contends that it cannot, and his reasoning is as follows: because the call of ideology is never &quot;pure&quot;--its coercive, positive claims (e.g., Be a good person! Share with others!) are necessarily supplemented by its internally transgressive &quot;seedy underside,&quot; which disrupts its positive claims from within (e.g. Be a good person! Share with others! [unless you decide that transnational business is your passion, in which case, by all means follow your heart...])--the actualization of a given ideological system is predicated on the disavowal of certain internal mandates of said system. In other words, the &quot;imperfection&quot; of ideology-in-practice is already present in ideology-in-form. Zizek&#039;s account suggests that internal disavowals are not the mark of ideology&#039;s mis-actualization (as though the &quot;real thing&quot; is lurking there somewhere behind its butchered form), but rather its proper actualization. Thus, throwing out the inconvenient and/or (ostensibly) non-sensical dimensions of ideology--a political manuever that we tend to laud as &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot;--becomes the gesture of ideology par excellence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, &quot;reasonable&quot; positions--as well as their formal basis, the overarching injunction to &quot;Be reasonable!&quot;--are critically bankrupt. In fact, whereas we generally conceive of &quot;ideological&quot; (in the connotative sense of moronically inexorable) positions as easy to maintain--essentially a *pre-critical* position that relies on utter blindness to the empirical reality that &quot;extremism never works&quot;--Zizek&#039;s analysis of ideology as internally split leads us to precisely the opposite conclusion: &quot;ideological&quot; positions that stubbornly refuse to break from the formal mandates a given ideology, even when such mandates seem &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;unreasonable,&quot; are, in fact, the hardest positions to live by. Indeed, does not the &quot;non-ideological&quot; position--the &quot;reasonable&quot; position that willfully amends its principles on cue, and thereby facilitates the continual reinscription of hegemony--exemplify the very notion of an easy position? What could be easier than amending one&#039;s viewpoint according to the shifting winds of whatever seems &quot;reasonable&quot; (or more to the point, what &quot;expert&quot; techno-crats tell us is reasonable) at the time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#039;s at stake when Atwood takes the dominant ideologies (of her contemporaneous moment) to their extreme, utilizing their internal logic as the basis of socio-political critique? I&#039;d suggest that we should read The Handmaid&#039;s Tale as a work of &quot;critical heresy,&quot; understanding &quot;heresy&quot; as the refusal to perform the disavowals necessary to found an ideological system in practice, and simply maintaining the ideology in its pure form. The heretic is, for all intents and purposes, the figure who refuses the constitutive of auto-transgressions of systems of power, and thereby takes the logical underpinning of systemic domination to its internal (and often absurd) limit-point. The heretic thus steps outside of ideology precisely by staying within it. (This is precisely the basis of the resistive capacity that Zizek locates in hyper-conformity--stepping outside the confines of Law precisely by staying fully and uncompromisingly within them.) Atwood&#039;s heretical inclinations stem from socio-political malaise. She&#039;s not arguing that The Handmaid&#039;s Tale depicts a Utopian landscape whose conditions should be brought to their &quot;actually existing&quot; form in the real-world; rather, she&#039;s attempting to undermine the ideological fabric of her historical moment by taking it to its &quot;natural&quot; extreme. In fact, seems as though this mode of heresy--understood as the impulse to take an ideology &quot;more seriously than it takes itself&quot;--operates in many science-fictional narratives (toward equally progressive and reactionary ends, we should note). We tend to think that critique is most potent when it underscores how social arrangements are failing, but it can be far more subversive to highlight when such arrangements are working perfectly--though to horrific ends.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Techno-Eden? (Gibson response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/75</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in what people make of Gibson&#039;s invocation of the mythologized Fall  from Eden (common to the Western monotheistic traditions) to thematize Case&#039;s feelings about his initial neurological damage--and his ontological status more generally: &quot;For Case, who&#039;d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it [the damage] was the Fall. In the bars he&#039;d frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh.&quot; (7) It&#039;s interesting that Gibson chooses to use the metaphorical (as opposed to, e.g., simile) structure to recall this particular theological referent. For Case, the damage was not &quot;like&quot; a fall; it is a fall. Furthermore, the damage is not a fall, but in fact, the Fall--the singular fall from (Eden into the world of sin) that supposedly defines human subjectivity. If this is true, however, what happend to Case&#039;s originary Fall? If the damage inflicted by his old bosses = the Fall, what about the foundational imperfection that&#039;s Biblically posited as universal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case&#039;s situation seems to present the following existential schematic (in linear order [though Eden can never really be said to &quot;exist&quot; as such; it&#039;s more of a mythical &quot;past that was never present&quot;]): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eden -- Fall -- Re-realization of Eden (via cyberspace) -- Fall (from damage) -- ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Case&#039;s second Fall (from the neurological damage) was, in fact, &quot;the Fall,&quot; it seems to imply one of two things: either a) the first &quot;Fall&quot; was illegitimate (i.e., not really a &quot;fall&quot;) and thus the second, post-damage &quot;Fall&quot; is the sole constitutive fall of Case&#039;s person, or b) the re-realization of Eden through cyberspace was illegitimate (i.e., it may have felt Utopian, but it actually wasn&#039;t) and thus the second, post-damage &quot;Fall&quot;merely re-instantiates the originary Fall from Eden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both routes have interesting consequences. On the one hand, the illegitimacy of the originary Fall (from Eden) denotes an unorthodox--though currently dominant--sensibility w/r/t imperfection. Anti-Utopianism (&quot;humans will be always be flawed&quot; / &quot;things will never be perfect&quot; / etc.) is widespread in the postmodern world; contemporarily, it is hardly radical to suggest that imperfection is an irreducible aspect of social life. Indeed, once it becomes incoherent--or plain and simple naive--to envision perfection, it no longer makes sense to talk about an originary Fall predicated on the notional idea of an Eden, since Eden is an inherently un-realizable &quot;perfect&quot; space. In other words, if we buy the premise that life is irrevocable in its imperfection (and let&#039;s be clear: this premise can be highly redemptive), then the &quot;Fall&quot; simply describes how things are. In which case, it&#039;s not a fall; it&#039;s reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second proposition--the illegitimacy of techno-Eden, implying that Case&#039;s damage re-instantiates, as opposed to invents, the Fall--is best understood in terms of the psychoanalytic concept of &quot;lack.&quot; Case&#039;s claim that his damage &quot;was the Fall&quot; clearly presumes that his pre-damage condition (i.e., neuronal firings immersed in cyberspace) was worthy of being deemed &quot;Eden&quot;--a tall order indeed. While it&#039;s easy to maintain a haughty distance from this claim (after all, we [cynics] know that digital life will never offer the same fruits as material life), is this not an example of Case taking advantage of the exact same defense mechanisms (or at least homologous defense mechanisms) that most of us employ on a daily basis? Here, he has simply generated an &quot;if only&quot; narrative--&quot;If only I could jack in, I&#039;d be fine!&quot; / &quot;If only those criminals hadn&#039;t afflicted me, I&#039;d be happy!&quot;--that should be familiar to anyone who&#039;s ever had to contend with disapointment (e.g., &quot;If only I got that shiny new red wheelbarrow [on which everything might depend], I&#039;d be happy!&quot;). In this sense, Case&#039;s damage (and the feeling of &quot;Fall&quot; that accompanies it) gestures toward the *historicity of lack* in human experience--that is, the way in which lack manifests itself over and over again: precisely by way of the pathological formations that we use to (falsely) fill the space of lack, the content of which might change from historical period to historical period (as it does for Case, when his expectations change from human to trans-human), but the form of which continually reproduces and re-articulates itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might Case&#039;s name be of some significance in this respect? What if we &quot;Case&quot; as the limit-example of particularism (which is, in some sense, exactly what&#039;s at stake--both concretely and abstractly--in the mind v. body question, especially in light of its racialized and gendered overtones)? Western metaphysics has tended to conceive of particularity and universality in dialectical terms, which is to say, as if the two were caught in perpetual, fundamentally insoluble tension. This dialectical tendency presents universality and particularity as mutually exclusive: I can make universal claims or particular claims, but not both at the same time; I can uphold my universal duty (e.g., to not steal) or my particularistic duty (e.g., extenuating circumstances that force me to steal in order to feed my family), but not both. Might Case occupies the hybrid, connective space between universality and particularity? (For instance, a &quot;case study&quot; designates the particularized example that we use to elucidate the universal point; &quot;In case of emergency&quot; prefaces a universal space for making particularized claims; etc.) A &quot;case&quot; is precisely what allows us to grasp the playing-out of a universal or trans-historical problematic (such as &quot;lack&quot;) in a particularistic or historical context. Perhaps Case embodies historicity itself?&lt;/p&gt;
