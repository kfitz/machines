 <title>jimmy/snowman&#039;s dependency on oryx</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/346</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Snowman is one of the most heartbreaking characters I have encountered in fiction.  Within the first few chapters, with no knowledge of Snowman&#039;s history or even personality, I felt such pity for him.  He can do nothing but waste away in his loneliness and gloom.  While the character of Jimmy is hardly a vision of integrity, he is a good person.  He is a confused, insecure man whose soul has been scarred since the day his mother disappeared.  Considering Jimmy&#039;s fascination with words, I found it interesting that his memory of his mother&#039;s good-bye note consists of little more than blah, blah, blah.  It is simply too painful for him to articulate the pain he experienced when his mother abandoned him.  He constantly wants Oryx to verbally articulate her traumas and yet he is unwilling to come to grips with his own.  Yes, he uses the story of his mother as a tool to land girls but his scornful apathy towards the incident is indicative of his buried pain.  Not to psychoanalyze Jimmy too much, but his issues with commitment must somewhat stem from the fact that the most important woman in his life left him with nothing but a note.  Jimmy may act as though he does not need his mother but she continually appears in the story long after her physical departure.  There is of course something to be said about the fact that the final words that run through Snowman&#039;s head before heading down to the beach are those of Oryx and his mother.  Oryx says, &quot;Oh Jimmy you were so funny.&quot;  His mother&#039;s voice reiterates what she had said to him in the video: &quot;Don&#039;t let me down.&quot;  This command is symbolic of what Snowman understands to be his relationship with his mother.  Even though this is never actually written, it is inevitable that Jimmy feels somewhat culpable for his mother&#039;s departure.  He disappointed her and never earned the chance to redeem himself.&lt;br /&gt;
	   Jimmy tries to replace this void with Oryx.  Here is where I feel as though Snowman is not an entirely reliable narrator.  Due to the lack of a maternal presence in his life, Jimmy quickly clings onto Oryx, who naturally invokes a motherly persona.  She is brought on to Crake&#039;s project to essentially raise the Crakers and Jimmy ends up needing her to take care of him as well.  In many ways, Jimmy projects his insecurities onto Oryx.  &quot;There was Crake&#039;s story about her, and Jimmy&#039;s story about her as well, a more romantic version; and then there was her own story about herself, which was different from both and not very romantic at all&quot; (114).  Jimmy desperately needs Oryx to be a certain way so he creates his own image of her.  He wants her to be this broken person that he can repair when in reality, he is the one who needs to be mended. I don&#039;t know if Jimmy actually ever loved Oryx; it is obvious he was fixated with her but did this have more to do with the actual Oryx or Jimmy&#039;s emotional problems?  Perhaps the saddest part about the story of Jimmy and Oryx is that I doubt Oryx every truly cared for Jimmy.  &quot;&#039;Crake lives in a higher world, Jimmy,&#039; she said.  &#039;He lives in a world of ideas.  He is doing important things.  He has no time to play.  Anyway, Crake is my boss.  You are for fun&quot; (313).  While Oryx means everything to Jimmy/Snowman, he is little more than a means of entertainment.  While Crake is busy, she passes the time with Jimmy.  I could be completely off with this reading, but I do believe that Jimmy&#039;s obsession with Oryx allows Snowman to remember their past through a filter.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>reading Pattern Recognition as a postmodern novel</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/317</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class on Monday, the issue of genre classification was discussed at length.  The question was posed as to whether &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; should be read as a science fiction novel.  A glance over Gibson&#039;s previous works would have one believe that indeed, &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is a piece of science fiction genius, similar to &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  Besides the obvious observation that &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; differs greatly in style and plot from &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; I would also argue that they do not fit in the same genre.  While reading &quot;Pattern Recognition,&quot; I continually felt as though I was reading a postmodern novel as opposed to a science fiction one.  This should not be so surprising considering that elements of postmodernism and science fiction often overlap.  In fact, we read the article &quot;Cyber-punk and the Crisis of Postmodernity&quot; alongside &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  In the article, Lance Olsen writes, &quot;as Darko Suvin argues, all science fiction is by nature a &#039;literature of cognitive estrangment&#039;; and, as McHale adds, science fiction is to the postmodern what detective fiction was to modernism: it is the ontological par excellence&#039;&quot; (148).       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in 2003, &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is interesting because as opposed to most science fiction novels, it takes place in the present.  Yet the description of the present seems eerily futuristic.  &quot;Hotmail downloads four messages, none of which she feels like opening.  Her mother, three spam.  The penis enlarger is still after her, twice, and Increase Your Breast Size Dramatically&quot; (5).  Anyone who has email recognizes this experience.  And yet it still looks absurd when seen in writing.  We are living in the present but we are unable to keep up.  This disorientation of time is a significant theme throughout the novel as well as in postmodernism.  Bigend believes that we have no future or history because our present is too unstable.  When he claims that &quot;History is a best-guess narrative about what happened and when&quot; (59), I was immediately reminded of Lyotard&#039;s claim that postmodernism signified the &quot;end of metanarratives,&quot; and thus history.  Time can no longer be used as an organizing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This postmodern rejection of history is interesting to look at alongside &quot;Pattern Recognition&#039;s&quot; references to the 9/11 attacks.  For Gibson, this disaster served as a significant shift in time.  One could even read it as his end of history.  Case&#039;s memories of 9/11 coincide with the last time she saw her father.  Case nor NYC will ever be the same again.  Jean Baudrillard, a postmodern theorist who argues that there is no reality, referred to 9/11 as the &quot;absolute event.&quot;  Perhaps 9/11 was the event that threw us into the future before we were ready to deal with our present.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of style, I find &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; to be shamelessly postmodern.  Case&#039;s experiences and observations resemble a Baudrillardian simulacrum.  At one point Gibson even describes something as simulacra of simulacra of simulacra.  Of course, I instantly thought of &quot;Fight Club&quot; when the narrator refers to a copy of a copy of a copy.  Case exists in a dream-like state where reality never seems reliable.  &quot;Damien&#039;s Studio Display fill with darkness absolute.  It is as if she participates in the very birth of cinema&quot; (23).  In a scene such as this, one wonders who needs history when you can experience everything through simulacra?  The most frightening aspect of &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is that it exists in a postmodern world and we are have now entered a post-postmodern existence.  If one is to agree with the tenants of postmodernism, then &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; serves as a frightening reminder that we live in a world where we cannot rely on time or space to understand our identity.  History has ended either with the end of metanarratives or the 9/11 attacks.  Reality has been replaced by simulacra.  While Case&#039;s present may seem like the future to us, our present is in fact the future to Case.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the parody of ethnicity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/264</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During the student led discussion on Monday the issue of Asian representation in Snow Crash was brought up.  The concern was voiced that depicting Asians as a single race was reverting back to when Westerners refused to differentiate between Asians. While in many attempts the book does reject stereotypes, there are still unyielding definitions of race.  While I wholly agree that these are legitimate observations, I feel that Stephenson made the subversive decision to not distinguish between any of the races.  There is a sense, certainly in the Metaverse, that people no longer feel the need to use their ethnicity as a primary method of identification.  In a world where money has lost its value and everyone is sovereign, geography and culture have become inconsequential.  Not surprisingly, this translates to a lack of human attachment to one&#039;s ethnic group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a technically advanced world as Metaverse, self-representation is constructed in a new and bizarre way.  The players may not be constrained by their race but their socioeconomic circumstances certainly play a factor.  Avatars are still recognized by their class within the economy.  People enter the virtual reality to escape their own reality but they cannot escape the fact that wealth equals power.  The Metaverse does not allow one&#039;s imaginations to run free; rather it reinforces the restraints of real life.  On that note, I found it interesting that often, the avatars did not attempt to lead their lives that differently than they did in the non-virtual world.  Also, was anyone else humored by the fact that one could make his penis as large as he so desired but could not be taller than he was in real life?  Very oddâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the issue of blending ethnicities, I was interested in what the Mafia symbolized.  Of course, it lived up to the traditional connotations of the Mafia with its emphasis being on the &quot;family&quot; and loyalty.  Snow Crash&#039;s Mafia, however, is not solely comprised of the stereotypical Italian gangsters.  On the contrary, this Mafia&#039;s family has Jamaicans, Mexicans and Asians.  Having nothing to do with blood, the Mafia is an organization of many races that still bases its principles on respect and of course, hierarchy.  Hiro Protagnoist exists within an array of ethnicities and cultures.  His first job in the novel is delivering pizzas for the Mafia.  He lives in Mr. Lee&#039;s Hong Kong and has a Russian roommate.  A underlying commonality between the characters is that they are not concerned with someone&#039;s ethnic background.  They are instead all driven by the Mafia attitude â€“ how will this person help me get what I want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I believe that, like the majority of the novel&#039;s themes, the representation of race is satirical.  How can one even place importance on ethnicity when the majority of time is spent in a virtual world where your persona is completely your own creation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lore&#039;s dependency issues</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/230</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on &quot;Slow River,&quot; everyone is obviously interested in what the book has to say about identity.  Lore constantly struggles with her inability to ever truly inhabit one of her three characters.  &quot;I slept for nine hours and woke up feeling stiff and sore, as though my body had tried to rearrange itself physically to fit three people inside one skin. (294)&quot; The persona of Bird seems rather insignificant to me because while this is the PIDA Lore has adapted, she never really replaces Bird&#039;s place in the world.  The taking on of Bird&#039;s identity is a purely technical process.  Lore never actually becomes Bird in an emotional sense - she knows nothing of Bird&#039;s history in regards to family and relationships.  While in the work environment Lore does consider what Bird&#039;s actions would be, she never succeeds at suppressing her knowledge, as proven by Magyar&#039;s quick suspicions.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my reading, Lore is Lore of the van de Oest family, Spanner&#039;s Lore or Magyar&#039;s Lore.  Her personality and actions are dependent on the people who surround her.  When growing up with her family, Lore is always bending over backwards to please her parents.  Lore&#039;s desire for Katerine&#039;s approval is what drives her work ethic and ultimately blinds her to her mother&#039;s horrific behavior.  Lore&#039;s life goals were decided for her at birth and she has little say in the matter.  She is disgusted by Stella&#039;s rebellious ways and does not realize till it&#039;s too late that Stella was actually trying to define herself as a separate entity from her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Lore proves her strength and grit when she attacks her kidnapper and escapes.  But then Spanner takes her under her wing and forms Lore&#039;s new identity.  Lore takes on a life of crime and deceit.  At her worse moment, Lore is under the spell of not only Spanner, but also the drug that she consumes in order to tolerate the prostitution Spanner has forced her into.  While Lore continually feels shame for the acts she commits, she does not have the confidence in her own identity to break away from Spanner.  She loses respect for herself and eventually projects this onto Spanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore finally does leave Spanner, she quickly finds someone else to base her personality off of â€“ Magyar.  Lore&#039;s relationship with Magyar is a sharp contrast to her certainly dysfunctional relationship with Spanner.  While her time with Spanner was greatly defined by sex, Lore&#039;s connection with Magyar is much more rooted in emotions.  She tells Magyar, &quot;I&#039;ve never had any romance, ever.  But how could I?  I&#039;ve been so many people, I never knew which ones were real.  I want to find that out before you and Iâ€¦ before we go any further. (300)&quot; At this moment, Lore is expressing that she wants to recognize her true self before being defined by her bond with someone else.  Yet I doubt that she ever really does this.  Magyar is the one who forces Lore to face her demons and attempt to reconstruct her life by contacting her father.  Who knows if Lore would have ever found the motivation to call her father if it weren&#039;t for Magyar and Spanner.  I found the final sentence to be sweet but also disturbing.   After just reclaiming her identity as Francis Lorien van de Oest, Lore walks with Magyar and thinks, &quot;When I met my family again, I would introduce them to both of us. (343)&quot; Clearly, Magyar is a positive force in Lore&#039;s life but what happened to her claim that she was going to find herself before progressing the relationship?  Shouting out your name does not mean you know yourself.  The fact that she wants to reconnect with her family with Magyar by her side implies that she has not really discovered herself.  Rather, she is still depending on a stronger partner to carry her through life&#039;s discomforts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Imago response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/186</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading &quot;Imago,&quot; I was continually struck by the growing resemblances between the Oankali and Humans.  And I am not referring to the Humans that lived with Oanklai, but rather the Humans who had refused to assimilate with the aliens.  I first noticed an Oankali acting uncharacteristically human when Jodahs and his family must leave their village.  Nikanj has to be assured that Lilith brought her machete.  Jodahs narrates, &quot;It could not have gotten more attention if it had screamed.  I focused on it to the exclusion of everything, felt pulled around to face it.  Oankali did not suggest violence.  Humans said violence was against Oankali beliefs.  Actually, it was against their flesh and bone, against every cell of them&quot; (564).  While Nikanj is of course rational in his fear of Human violence being inflicted on his family, he is speaking against a fundamental Oankali code.  Nikanj does reiterate that violence should only be used when absolutely necessary but Jodahs&#039; dismayed reaction is proof of how atypical Nikanj&#039;s question was.  Throughout the trilogy, the Oankali consider themselves on a more sophisticated plane than Humans because they do not harbor the genetic inclination towards violence.  The Oankali claimed that they had the need to heal.  They justified mass sterility because they were convinced that humans would breed violent creatures.  So for Nikanj to even suggest violence is rejecting everything its species stands for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Jodahs encountered Tomas and Jesusa, I recognized several qualities they shared with the Oankali.  On a purely aesthetic level, the siblings are as grotesque looking as the aliens.  Their tumors are the equivalent of the growths Jodahs must experience during his metamorphosis.  These humans can empathize with the feeling of being completely aware that people find them hideous.  The Oankali are so fascinated by the Humans that they find them to be beautiful.  This is not a shared feeling for the Humans.  They feel sexually attracted to the ooloi but this scares many of them.  Like Jodahs says at one point â€“ Humans are incredibly concerned with physical appearance.  They find the Oankali outwardly hideous creatures and thus cannot bear the thought of sexually desiring them.  A random side note: What if the Oankali were incredibly attractive aliens.  Would Humans still have been so reluctant to breed with them even though they would still be alien creatures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress.  Before finding out Jesusa and Tomas are siblings, Jodahs believed they were mates.  The two share a strong connection, similar to the ones Oankali siblings feel with each other.  When attempting to understand why Tomas and Jesusa did not care how they looked Jodahs writes, &quot;Perhaps it was because there were two of them.  If they were siblings they had been together most of their lives.  Perhaps they sustained one another&quot; (625).  This special closeness obviously becomes more like an Oankali siblinghood when Jodahs wants the two to mate with each other.  But something that struck me as even more prevalent in &quot;Imago&quot; was the Human sense of compassion.  Jesusa is shocked when Jodahs doubted whether they would stay with him through metamorphosis.  They want to do everything they can to help him through the process.  Akin&#039;s Human friends acted the same when he underwent his maturation.  These are Humans who have isolated themselves from Oankali way of life and yet they still have the urge to heal.  Not all humans need to be violent just like not all Oankali are genetically absolutely resistant to using violence.  The Oankali continually tried to draw a distinct line between their genes and Human&#039;s genes.  Their lives circle around the needs of the group so it makes sense that they would view Humans as one group of hierarchal species.  But they fail to realize that there are individual exceptions and these are illustrated through several of the Human characters in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>alien colonialism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/157</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my reading of &quot;Dawn,&quot; I found myself torn between where my sympathies should lie.  The Oankali seemed compassionate enough and Lilith&#039;s relationship with Nikanj struck me as genuine and surprisingly not creepy.  And yet it is difficult to trust the motives of a group of creatures that put humans asleep for centuries and then keep them trapped in a ship.  There were moments when Lilith&#039;s resistance annoyed me and then at other times I was shocked by her ability to cohabitate with these seemingly grotesque features.  I continually put myself in the position of Lilith and I was forced to acknowledge that I would not be nearly as brave or patient as her.  Being the only human among alien creatures is indeed a terrifying concept.  There was much criticism of Lilith&#039;s decision making in class and I have to argue in Lilith&#039;s defense.  I believe she went above and beyond what the majority of humans would have done in her situation.  Curt may be a brave man in the sense that he is absolutely determined to lead his life away from the Oankali.  But he is also foolish because he never gives the Oankali a chance to prove themselves as decent creatures.  Ultimately I realized that Lilith was such an appealing candidate to the Oankali because she was strong, intelligent and more importantly, open-minded.&lt;br /&gt;
 	Should the Oankali have forced the humans to cross breed with them?  No.  Do I understand why they did it?  Absolutely.  It would be ludicrous for anyone to claim that if a ship full of alien creatures landed on Earth tomorrow, we would not conduct numerous tests on them.  We would of course be fearful but our curiosity would overrule.  I am clearly more hesitant to say that humans would have any desire to mass procreate with them but I would not be surprised if there was some attempt at isolated cross breeding.  The Oankali are naturally very curious creatures.  They are simply fascinated by the race of humans and are eager to save them and then start a future with them.  While they are not open about all their intentions in the beginning, they are incapable of actually lying.  Akin &quot;had always found it easy to tell the truth and difficult to make himself lie&quot; (351).  Humans cannot boast this need for the truth.  &quot;Humans, on the other hand, lied easily and often.  They could not trust one another.  They could not trust one of their own who seemed too close to aliens, who stripped off her clothing and lay down on the ground to help her jailer&quot; (238).  While the Oankali hope to see the good in everyone, humans are  constantly doubtful.&lt;br /&gt;
	Within the first few chapters of &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; I had my mind set in favor the Oankali.  This is not to say that they did not make mistakes in their handling of the humans.  This is also not to say that they should serve as the epitome of morality.  But I do believe they are a more sophisticated race than the humans in many ways.  They display an inherent goodness that the humans simply don&#039;t have.  One must only look at how welcomed Tino was into the Oankali tribe in comparison to how carelessly and in fact violently the group of nomads treated baby Akin.  His presence excited many humans in Phoenix but this was only because they had desired a baby for so long and at least this one was normal looking.  And still, several of the humans are repelled by Akin because of his gray tongue and thus connection to the aliens.  They refuse to see the Oankali as a race in any way equal to them.  The fact their survival is thanks to these aliens means little to them.&lt;br /&gt;
	I found the story of the merger between the Oankali and the humans as a twisted version of extraterrestrial colonialism.  Here, the humans are essentially the savages who need to be taught how to inhabit the Earth.  However, the Oankali do not behave like traditional colonialists.  They do allow the humans to build their own villages; albeit with the knowledge that they can never have babies.  Rather than exerting violence on the humans, they give people like Lilith defense mechanisms against the humans who will most likely attack her.  This is because they understand humans&#039; inclination towards violence.  Akin describes how the nomads &quot;did hit each other occasionally.  Twice, a pair of them rolled in the mud, punching and clutching at one another.  Even when they did not fight, they cursed each other and cursed him.&quot; (334)  Two centuries after destroying the world through violence, humans still cannot resist the urge for physical aggression.  And yet they still carry the strong need to love and be loved.  Iriarte has great trouble letting Akin go because he reminds him of one of his children.  This is why the humans&#039; dilemma is so problematic and why it is ultimately so difficult to choose sides.  I believe that the humans need to recognize the flaws that almost killed them before and at least attempt to understand the creatures that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Offred&#039;s mother</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/95</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuman&#039;s article &quot;Just a Backlash&quot; forced me to do a closer reading of the various representations of feminism in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale.  I was most taken aback by Atwood&#039;s strong resistance to being labeled a feminist.  While she fittingly points out that &quot;No one who observes society can fail to make observations that are feminist&quot; (858), she is also quick to critique the more extreme form of feminism.  She claims, &quot;If practical, hardline, anti-male feminists took over and became the government, I would resist them.&quot;  Atwood&#039;s self-identification as a &#039;tamer&#039; feminist brings up the question of what the female characters within the novel truly represent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though her physical presence in the book is minimal, I found Offred&#039;s mother to be one of the most interesting characters.  With her book burnings and banner protests, the mother personifies the 1970&#039;s feminist.  She adamantly claims that there is no room for a man in her life; she asks Offred, &quot;What use are they except for 10 seconds&#039; worth of half babies&quot; (12).  The mother is the feminist who Atwood never wants to be associated with.  The mother thinks herself superior to men, at the very least in an intellectual sense.  She credits them for their ability to fix cars and play football but not much else.  Offred&#039;s mother does not seek equality for men and women; rather she would most likely be content if the male race was wiped out completely.  However, she made a comment to Offred that struck me as sad and contradictory.  Only a few lines after criticizing Offred for not understanding all that had been done for female rights, Offred paints quite a different picture of her mother.  She writes, &quot;Sometimes she would cry.  I was so lonely, she&#039;d say.  You have no idea how lonely I was.  And I had friends, I was a lucky one, but I was lonely anyway&quot; (122).  I could not help but imagine that she was so lonely because she did not have a man.  With this statement I am hardly attempting to take the stance that every straight woman needs a man in her life to feel complete.  But I do believe her admittance to feeling lonely gives the mother a side that does perhaps desire a man.  She says she had friends but they were clearly not enough.  She needed a space filled in her life and often this space is fulfilled by the presence of a man to love or at least care for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is not much more to read into this brief moment of vulnerability, but I suspect Atwood is criticizing the man-hating feminist that does not necessarily seek progression into equal rights.  No matter how much feminists may categorize men as chauvinists only driven by sex and sports, ultimately, they can not fully deny the need for men.  Fine, Offred&#039;s mother knows that men are needed to reproduce but she is less willing to admit that at times, she missed the simple touch of a man.  While they clearly had different objectives in mind, in some ways, I found the Aunts to be an extreme representation of the 1970s feminist.  Of course they were strict enforcers of the rules of a government that oppressed women.  But they also encouraged the girls to take advantage of the sexual control they had over men.  Even in the disgusting scene where the girls were encouraged to blame Janine for being raped, the Aunts wanted the girls to take responsibility for their roles as sexual beings.  Men were depicted as little more than sperm donors.  Clearly the Aunts are not shining images of feminist ideals but it is worth considering them as a terrifying depiction of that &quot;hardline&quot; feminist taking over the government.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the cyborg female</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/64</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As general the topic may be, at the end of the novel, I was most aware of its gender representations.  The fact that Case is a cowboy and Molly a street-samurai sets the stage for a paradoxical and certainly complex relationship between genders.  The traditional cowboy belongs to a vast, unexplored frontier with horses and Native Americans with rifles.  In the case of the street-samurai, I envision a grittier existence that requires a strong sense of street knowledge.  Upon their meeting, it is established that Case is a self-deprecating drug addict who needs the help of dominant Molly.  Case allows Molly to hold him together, sexually and emotionally.  Ironically, Molly is anything but the nurturing soul.  She bluntly states, &quot;What I think about first is my own sweet ass&quot; (30).  Molly does not exhibit the same neediness towards Case.  In fact, in the end, Molly does not need or even desire the presence of Case in her life.  Molly&#039;s primary need is for Case to &quot;ride&quot; her in cyberspace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly is science fiction&#039;s &quot;working girl.&quot;  She made her way as a prostitute and she appears to carry no regret.  I believe the fact that Molly was once a prostitute does not sexually demean her but in fact empowers her.  Sex is simply another way for Molly to exert control over the men who surround her.  She is a sexual being and she embraces that and recognizes the way in which that can influence men.  She sells her body sexually so that she can physically enhance it.  Molly uses her body the way Case uses his brain.  The body is her tool for survival.  Following her stint as a prostitute, Molly sells her services as a bodyguard, a role most often filled by a man.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women may be seen as an annoying disruption in the traditional western narrative but in &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; Molly is perhaps the most physically powerful character.  She exhibits more enhancements than anyone else and I found it interesting that her head has silicone in it.  In an utter rejection of the hypersexual female stereotype, Molly has her brain rather than her breasts enhanced.  Much can be said about the fact that in order for Molly&#039;s optical implants to work, her tear ducts had to be sealed shut.  Thus, it is not that Molly is not emotionally capable of crying; she physically cannot produce tears.  In a sense, this allows Molly to not be completely de-feminized.  Yes, her tears come in the form of spit, but she still is willing to express those tears.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think it is interesting to question whether Gibson is attempting to redefine the feminine role in science fiction or if the depiction of Molly was supposed to stand as an introduction to the new cyborg identity.  Perhaps, there can no longer be a clear distinction between the roles males and females must inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>military and fascism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/43</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Starship Troopers is on the reading list for four of the five military academies is certainly not surprising.  The book is the story of a man who finds enlightenment through his progression in the military.  Johnny discovers that one must make personal sacrifices in order to be a citizen.  It is a privilege that one must be willing to die for.  With that said, I find it difficult to recognize any true change in the character of Johnny.  Yes, he is wiser in the military trade and can regurgitate what he has been told to be true.  But Johnny remains little more than a soldier.  He describes his experiences in boot camp and later in the Officer Candidate School and yet I don&#039;t feel as though the reader truly ever knows Johnny.  I realize Heinlin was not hoping for the reader to form a personal connection to Johnny but I did find the story cold and eerily void of emotions.  There was no time to make meaningful connections or discoveries â€“ there was no time for the individual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book makes great effort in marking an anti-communist stand, I did find many aspects of the society to have a fascist ring.  There was not an obvious superior race or religion among the humans â€“ countries joined together to defend their planet.  But humans did claim greatness over the Bugs and Skinnies.  The inhabitants of planet Earth believed themselves to be a more deserving species than any other planet&#039;s species.  I do not support the proposal that the novel is racist but the sentiment that humans are the superior species is clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s fascist underpinning displays itself within the classroom discussions, especially within the views of Mr. Dubois.  Calling Marx a &quot;pompous fraud,&quot; Dubois says, &quot;The Marxian definition of value is ridiculous.  All the work one cares to add will not turn a mud pie into an apple tart; it remains a mud pie, value zero&quot; (92).  One must not follow the rules of Marxism, what Heinlein would most likely refer to as idealistic.  In order for a society to advance, one must depend on the military and with that violence.  People in the military cannot consider their individual needs; they have to fight only for the progression of their platoon.  This is obviously a standard ethic of military services but it is also fascist on a grander scale.  A fascist society must function as a united front.  A human&#039;s needs must equate to the needs of his or her country.  The fact that only veterans can participate in elections speaks to my belief that Heinlein&#039;s utopian society would be one ruled by military and fascism.&lt;/p&gt;
