 <title>oryx and crake response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/357</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For my Oryx and Crake presentation, I focused on how I saw Oryx and Crake to be like an updated version of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and I wanted to go further in depth on this topic for my reader response. Some of this is kind of rehashing what I said earlier, so I apologize for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reading Oryx and Crake, I kept thinking back to The Handmaid&#039;s Tale. I haven&#039;t read any Margaret Atwood novels besides these two, so I&#039;m not sure if the similarities I saw between the two novels are actually trademark Atwood devices that she uses in all her novels, but I felt that there were some pretty significant similarities that tied the two novels together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that jumped out at me was how both stories used the same narrative style. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, Offred, the main character, is currently in the future and spends the story both retelling her past and describing her present circumstances. In Oryx and Crake, Snowman, the main characterâ€¦is currently in some future world and reminisces about his past while trying to survive in his current world. Both books use sort of a nonlinear structure to slowly unravel aspects of the story. In both cases, the reader initially does not know how the future world came about â€“ this, along with background story on the main character, are slowly revealed through flashbacks. This nonlinear method of storytelling is a pretty jarring aspect of both novels and introduced intriguing dimensions to the story. It is interesting to first meet Snowman when he is in his adult years and then read about how his character developed through his flashbacks; the same goes for Offred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other significant similarity is the concept of both novels. In both stories, the main characters are set in a future world in which something terrible has happened to humanity. Atwood tried in both cases to make the formation of this future world as believable as possible. Of course, the future world itself of Oryx and Crake will seem extremely outlandish, but the characters behind this future catastrophe and the events that transpire all seem to be very rooted in reality. What Atwood does in both novels is analyze the current state of the world at the time that she&#039;s writing the book and then try to make logical extrapolations from that current world. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, we see a corrupt government take over Offred&#039;s country and then transform it into a dystopian, totalitarian regime. This is a timeless concept, as the idea of a corrupt government laying waste to a country has been used constantly throughout literary history. The agent of destruction in Oryx and Crake, however, is biotechnology, which is why I see it as an updated version of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale. Once again, Atwood is analyzing the current state of the world at the time that she&#039;s writing the novel and speculating about where humanity could go from here with what it has. Technology has advanced significantly since the writing of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and with the advent of biotechnology, humanity now has even more ways to screw itself up, which is what Atwood explores in Oryx and Crake. The future world of Oryx and Crake is much more dire than that of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale because we are led to believe that humanity has simply been wiped out rather than subjected to a totalitarian government, reflecting the higher stakes of today&#039;s world. Thus, in the end, I saw Oryx and Crake as Atwood returning once again to analyze the world and give us her take on what we currently have and where we could go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>pattern recognition reader response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/319</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading this novel, I kept thinking about how I do not like works of science fiction to be set in the reality of the time it was written in, as was done in Pattern Recognition. If a science fiction story is supposed to be set in reality, then the author will have to incorporate markers of the present reality into the story to give the readers a sense of when it is taking place - in the case of Pattern Recognition, one way in which this was accomplished was constantly dropping brand names and products. I think that it is especially problematic for science fiction works focused on technology to be set in reality because the piece of work will be quickly outdated. Now, I realize that I&#039;m probably just being way too picky because the story can still function in spite of it being dated in some ways, but for me, I would prefer science fiction works to be set in alternate realities. Here, in Pattern Recognition, Gibson tries to have his story so connected to reality that he kind of misses it in the process. As someone said in class, when he talks about the technologies of today, it seems like he does not have a full understanding of what is going on, which, at least for me, detracts from the novel. One example of this is early on in the novel when he is talking about activity in the F:F:F forum. At one point, Cayce sits down in front of Damien&#039;s computer,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;â€¦opens F:F:F and sees that the posts have indeed been flying. But also, to a certain extent, that the shit has been hitting the fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia are flaming one another again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkaboy is de facto spokesperson for the Progressives, those who assume that the footage consists of a work in progress, something unfinished and still being generated by its maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Completists, on the other hand, a relative but articulate minority, are convinced that the footage is comprised of snippets fro ma finished work, one whose maker chooses to expose it piecemeal and in nonsequential order, Mama Anarchia is the consummate Completist.&quot; (Gibson, 49)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this whole sequence was pretty laughable. His dramatic announcement that shit was hitting the fan because Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia are &quot;flaming&quot; each other came off as just ridiculous to me. First off, &quot;flaming&quot; is such an archaic and cheesy term â€“ that&#039;s like a term that was used in the beginning stages of the internet and online chatting circa 1998 or something. To top it off, he gave that sentence its own paragraph to emphasize the gravity of the situation. Next, the idea that some people are so involved and tied up in a simple forum to warrant the serious proclamation that the &quot;â€¦shit has been hitting the fan&quot; also reeks of someone who is ten years behind in internet culture. I think at one point, the internet was seen as this almost mythological place, a whole another world where anybody could talk to anybody, but nowadays the internet is so integrated into daily life that I don&#039;t think forums hold the mystical power that they once did. Thus, the idea that argument within a forum would cause this much distress seems off. Also ridiculous is the premise that there is a serious war being raged online between two intense internet gangs. I don&#039;t know, maybe it&#039;s just because of my own personal bias against the internet that I cannot take anything from it seriously. In the end, I would prefer for science fiction to take place in alternate realities. When the story takes place in an alternate reality, the author cannot really miss with anything because he or she is creating all the rules for the world. However, when the story takes place in reality and the author speculates about various technologies, he or she runs a very high risk of screwing something up, and if that happens, it can detract from the story.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>response 8</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/256</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the Metaverse to be the most intriguing part of Snow Crash. It is astounding how much of the Metaverse is reflected in many current online entertainment programs, like World of Warcraft and Second Life as discussed in class. Stephenson has created an entirely believable future culture that is heavily rooted in technology because we are already seeing aspects of Snow Crash in today&#039;s world, like the aforementioned online games. There are people all over the world who are engaged in alternate lives on the internet in various MMORPGs and online communities, mirroring what people do in Snow Crash by using the Metaverse. For me, the idea of being able to create a completely new persona of your choice and then enter another world is simultaneously cool and disturbing. It is obviously cool because you can do things in the Metaverse that you cannot do in reality. The possibilities of what you can do in the Metaverse are essentially limitless â€“ as long as you have a good imagination and skill with programming, you can create whatever you want. For example, in Hiro&#039;s case, he can unleash his sword fighting abilities on other people without worry of consequences and even fit himself into sword fighting rankings. In addition, you can also completely customize your Metaverse persona, called your avatar â€“ &quot;Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment. If you&#039;re ugly, you can make your avatar beautiful. If you&#039;ve just gotten out of bed, your avatar can still be wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied makeup. You can look like a gorilla or a dragon or a giant talking penis in the Metaverse. Spend five minutes walking down the Street and you will see all of these&quot; (36). Thus, the greatest appeal of the Metaverse is giving people the opportunity to choose how they want to live and be whoever they want to be. Ultimately, though, while I think having some sort of virtual reality like the Metaverse would be cool in some respects, I feel that many aspects of the Metaverse are disturbing. Usage of the Metaverse sparks difficult questions, the main one being what is the point of being in reality when you can do whatever you want in the Metaverse? After all, &quot;Hiro spends a lot of time in the Metaverse. It beats the shit out of the U-Stor-It&quot; (24). I suppose the Metaverse is nice for people who are not satisfied with their lives, but at the same time, escaping into the Metaverse only perpetuates their real life problems because instead of devoting time towards managing reality, they can escape into virtual reality. Furthermore, social stratification occurs in the Metaverse too, making it a sort of fool&#039;s gold. Although there is freedom to customize your avatar in the Metaverse, wealth is required for sophisticated avatars. Consequently, the real life social status of people can be deduced through how nice their avatar looks â€“ for example, &quot;When white-trash high school girls are going on a date in the Metaverse, they invariably run down to the computer-games section of the local Wal-Mart and buy a copy of Brandy. The user can select three breast sizes: improbable, impossible, and ludicrous. Brandy has a limited repertoire of facial expressions: cute and pouty; cute and sultry; perky and interested; smiling and receptive; cute and spacy. Her eyelashes are half an inch long, and the software is so cheap that they are rendered as solid ebony chips&quot; (37). In the end, people run to the Metaverse for the promise of a better life there, only to encounter the same problems that they face in real life. The wealthiest people in reality are still dominating the Metaverse, getting into the best clubs and owning the best property. It seems that the Metaverse amounts to mainly a potentially harmful distraction to people, sucking away them away from real life to false hope in a virtual life.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 7</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/236</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Slow River was very much like a case study of a person, a comprehensive analysis of that person&#039;s life and what happened to them that made them into the person that they currently are. Nicola Griffith, in my opinion, was able to make Lore a very interesting and complex character. She was able to accomplish this in part because of the differing narrative perspectives in the   novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     One of the most prominent aspects of Slow River is the constant switching of perspective, from third person when describing the past to first person when describing the present. At first, I was kind of annoyed at this but I gradually came to appreciate it. This switching of perspectives has a powerful impact on the story. It manages to reflect the internal conflict that Lore is experiencing â€“ she feels like she is completely detached from her past, as if her past self is a completely different entity. Numerous times throughout the novel, she questions who her true self while rejecting her past. In one memorable passage, she is sitting on a rooftop, reminiscing about major events throughout her lifetime, when she suddenly steps onto a ledge and contemplates what implications suicide might bring: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was finishing the fourth can, I realized I was standing at the          edge of the roof. My toes poked over the gutter. One more step. No more  Sal Bird, aged twenty-five. No more fear about being found out; no more worries about dangerous people coming looking for me or Spanner; no more responsibility, feeling like I was the thin human wall between an unsuspecting city and an accident waiting to happen. It could all just stop. Here. Now. After all, Frances Lorien van de Oest had died a long time ago. (Griffith, 100)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Lore reveals the anguish that her past brings her, and how it has disgusted her to the point where she completely rejects her old self. The retelling of Lore&#039;s past in third person reinforces this notion. Instead of Lore personally taking the reader through her past, we get a more objective, detached narrator which more accurately reveals the chasm between Lore&#039;s past and present. The differing perspectives give the novel two dramatically different tones and adds a great deal of complexity. When the novel switches to Lore&#039;s past and consequently the third person perspective, it seems like the reader is made to feel powerless, because we are observing from a distance and do not receive any of Lore&#039;s thoughts. In contrast, when the story changes to the present and we are brought back to the first person, Lore seems like an extremely competent and intelligent being and it feels like she is much more in control of her situation. Before, Lore was powerless and entirely subject to the whims of her environment; now, Lore is the smartest person at her work place and is constantly fighting against her environment rather than constantly giving in to it. Ultimately, I think this switching of perspectives is one of the more poignant aspects of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 6? (I think?)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/198</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that stood out for me in Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand was the impact that sheer size in population can have on life (I saw one other blog post on this but I did not read it so hopefully there is not any overlap). One instance in which this is exemplified is the initial matching of Rat Korga and Marq Dyeth. When we first find out that Rat Korga and Marq Dyeth are supposedly fit for each other, the two men have been characterized in ways that made them radically different from each other. The entire prologue followed Rat Korga and described life on Rhyonon. In the beginning of the novel, Rat Korga undergoes essentially a lobotomy, and as a result, the whole introduction was written in a very somber, dull tone. Throughout Rat Korga&#039;s time on Rhyonon, he lives life as a RAT â€“ in other words, a slave - and spends his time doing mindless labor while being continually abused. At one point, one of Rat Korga&#039;s employers beats him while in a rage because Rat has been sold to a different employer. This experience perfectly encapsulates Rat&#039;s experience on Rhyonon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He worked and watched stories for three years; then one morning the man in charge came to kick him awake.&lt;br /&gt;
He pushed himself up to his elbow.&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;They sold you!&#039; The man kicked him again, about as hard as he&#039;d ever been kicked, so that he fell back down and had to up again. &#039;How you like that! They sold you out from under me! I&#039;ve really worked on you, too, you mindless rat! You don&#039;t treat a damned man like that. (Delany, 15)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on Rhyonon tended to view RATs as subhuman slaves who were more like tools than people. The existence of mindless slaves was not the only primitive aspect of Rhyonon. As we learn later on in the novel, Rhyonon is also largely cut off from the Web and therefore the rest of the universe, which makes Rat Korga seem even more primitive. Compare this with section with the main body of the novel, where we get a first-person account of Marq Dyeth&#039;s adventures. Here, the tone dramatically shifts to become more upbeat to reflect the increased vibrancy of the new worlds that we hear about. In contrast to Rat Korga, Marq Dyeth is very mentally sharp, which enables him to be an industrial diplomat, traveling from world to world interacting with a wide variety of species. His job requires him to be extremely familiar with the Web, which further sets him apart from Rat since Rat has always been very out of touch with his world and the surrounding universe. In spite of all these differences, however, Rat Korga and Marq Dyeth are found to be almost perfect erotic matches for each other. What does it mean when two completely different people are found to be erotically ideal for each other? I think one of the things that the whole matchmaking episode served was to highlight the impact that sheer size in population can have on life. In one memorable line from the novel, Japril states, &quot;But the thing you can be sure of in this day and age is that no one is the &#039;most&#039; of anything; just the &#039;most&#039; you happen to know about&quot; (Delany, 159). The matchmaking episode and the line from Japril remind us that if humanity ever reaches a point where we are living in a galactic civilization, there can really be no certainty in life, even with the presence of the Web. Life will have reached such a grand scale that everything can always be called into question because there may be some world light years away that has the answer. People involved in romantic relationships could wonder whether one of the 12 million other perfect erotic matches would work better, and with the aid of the Web, they could realistically reach those people. Ultimately, living on such a galactic scale would offer great diversity in life but perhaps also instability.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed The Left Hand of Darkness. It was a pretty entertaining novel for me - the journey across the Ice was a bit of a bummer because too much of it was devoted to purely describing them pulling the sledge across various areas, but other than that, it was good. I liked the political intrigue, the numerous backstabbings and the excitement that comes from following two characters who are running for their lives. However, after reading this novel as an action/adventure sort of story, I realized that I had not really thought about the impact that the androgynous nature of the Gethenians has on the meaning of the story. During my reading of the novel, I felt like this did not have that great of an effect on the overall story. After all, the biggest issue in the story was Genly Ai and Estraven&#039;s efforts in securing an alliance between Gethenians and the Ekumen. The androgynous nature of Gethenians was mentioned throughout the story, but it seemed more like a side note than anything else, as if it was briefly touched upon during breaks in action before being forgotten again. Now, after reconsidering the story after having read it, I realized that the androgynous nature of Gethenians does have a great effect on some aspects of the story. I guess ultimately the effect of having androgynous characters is to shock readers out of creating gender roles for genders. In my opinion, Le Guin accomplishes this specifically by continually referring to Gethenians as &quot;he&quot;. By doing this, she can lull readers into thinking of all Gethenians as men before writing about some feminine characteristic of a character that will contrast greatly with the image that the reader has built up to that point. This effect happens notably throughout the story. In one memorable instance, the king becomes pregnant. So, not only are Gethenians mainly referred to as &quot;he,&quot; but the ruler of the country is also referred to as a king, as a male. Thus, when strongly masculine characters, like the king, suddenly become pregnant, the reader is presented with an extremely strong dichotomy that really forces the reader to think about the dual nature of the characters. If Le Guin had constantly switched between referring to characters as &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot; and frequently reminded the reader of the dual characteristics of the character, I think the characters would not have been as shocking. She decided to use the technique of establishing a singular firm image in the readers&#039; minds and then completely twisting it to get the maximum shock value. Another instance of feminine characteristics suddenly appearing to disrupt a masculine image is when Genly Ai and Estraven have a heart-to-heart conversation while traversing the ice. According to Genly Ai, &quot;â€¦I saw then again, and for good, what I had always been afraid to see, and had pretended not to see in him: that he was a woman as well as a man. Any need to explain the sources of that fear vanished with the fear; what I was left with was, at last, acceptance of him as he wasâ€¦I had not been willing to give it. I had been afraid to give it. I had not wanted to give my trust, my friendship to a man who was a woman, a woman who was a man&quot; (248). Thus, even the Genly Ai had fallen into the trap of seeing the Gethenians as simply men instead of dual beings. This passage was sort of mind bending for me because I kept wanting to think of Estraven as a man who, well, occasionally turns into a woman from time to time instead of him being both man and woman all the time. Now, since Estraven is both man and woman all the time, it puts a very different spin on his character. I could no longer peg him as a certain gender; instead, I just had to see Estraven as a living being. Ultimately, I feel that this was one of Le Guin&#039;s goals â€“ once we remove the issue of gender from people, how do we feel about them? I think the conclusion reached is that they really are still the same as us.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Out of all three of the novels we have read so far, I like The Handmaid&#039;s Tale the best. Starship Troopers annoyed me because there were far too many soapbox moments for Heinlein and Neuromancer was difficult for me to follow because of the massive overload of descriptions of new technologies. The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is elegant. There is a certain grace to the writing and I feel that the story flows very well as a result of it. The most noteworthy aspect of the novel, at least for me, was how effective of a cautionary tale against blind trust and inaction it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atwood was able to make The Handmaid&#039;s Tale a cautionary tale that was very effective in instilling a sense of fear and caution in the reader. The world that the story took place in was extremely intriguing to me because of its similarities to our world, which is one of the main reasons why this novel is so chilling. It seems that Atwood intentionally left out elaborate descriptions of future technology to make the story be as realistic and familiar as possible. On my copy of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, there is an excerpt of a review on the back cover from the Houston Chronicle that states &quot;Atwood takes many trends which exist today and stretches them to their logical and chilling conclusionsâ€¦&quot;, which I agree with. By making the events of the story seem like plausible continuations of today&#039;s trends, Atwood is able to infuse almost a sense of urgency in her story, a very real feeling of alarm. The descriptions of the downfall of the old society are extremely disturbing because they seem believable. At one point in the story, Offred was reminiscing about the very beginning of the new society. After the president was assassinated, the new order &quot;â€¦suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn&#039;t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed home at night, watching television, looking for some direction. There wasn&#039;t even an enemy you could put your finger on&quot; (174). Offred remembered that &quot;[t]hings continued in that state of suspended animation for weeks, although some things did happen. Newspapers were censored and some were closed down, for security reasons, they said. The roadblocks began to appear, and Identipasses. Everyone approved of that, since it was obvious you couldn&#039;t be too careful. They said that new elections would be held, but that it would take some time to prepare for them. The thing to do, they said, was to continue on as usual&quot; (174). The most disturbing part of the revolution was how gradual it was. The new order preyed on the public&#039;s fear, slowly gaining their trust, until finally they had complete control. Another notable incident in the novel was the arrival of Japanese tourists who were free from the constraints of Gilead. For me, that was especially disturbing because it established a contrast that revealed the existence of more &quot;civilized&quot; societies out in the world. This made the oppression of Gilead seem even tragic, since there was salvation elsewhere in the world but it was completely out of reach for the women of Gilead. Additionally, this incident also added to the plausibility of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale because it brought to mind the Middle East, in which there is a real-life situation in which women are subject to extreme oppression. It highlighted the fact that scenarios like Gilead already exist in the world, making the novel even more chilling. One last aspect of the novel that really affected me was the overall tone of the writing - it is very melancholic and numbing and was critical in making The Handmaid&#039;s Tale poignant. I could not think of any one passage that epitomizes this tone, as it is necessary to really read the entire novel to truly get a feel for what it is like. Offred is a convincingly tortured and numb soul and her narrative on her life projects the feeling of a person who is almost completely worn down by life and struggling to keep on pushing herself through the day. All of these aspects of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale make it a very powerful story.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not really like Starship Troopers. It was a quick read and I thought the descriptions of the technology used and of the action were interesting, but ultimately the novel just felt like a piece of propaganda to me. The military is very glamorized and Heinlein&#039;s own political views are beat into the reader throughout the story. Both of these aspects of the story brought down the novel for me, as Starship Troopers seems like a call to action for people to either support or join the military and perform the noblest action of all, which is to put one&#039;s life at stake for one&#039;s country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that made Starship Troopers feel like propaganda is how much the Mobile Infantry is praised. It is depicted as an extremely effective and efficient branch of the military that does a lot of the dirty work for the homeland, a group that gets the job done and takes action when needed. One of the most prominent aspects of the Mobile Infantry is its sense of brotherhood. Various outfits of the Mobile Infantry, such as Rasczak&#039;s Roughnecks, are described as being as close as family. Everything seems to run smoothly, as all the soldiers work and fight together in harmony. The Mobile Infantry accomplishes all of this by never leaving any person behind on missions. Whenever possible, all soldiers make it their life&#039;s duty to retrieve wounded soldiers who have fallen behind. All of this combines to paint a very majestic picture of the Mobile Infantry, and really of the military in general. This is what I meant when I stated previously that Heinlein glamorizes the military. Admittedly, Heinlein does not characterize the Mobile Infantry as perfect. Portions of the book are devoted to describing the arduous training required to join the Mobile Infantry, including injuries and deaths resulting from the training. However, this in a way acts to further glamorize the military. The final message regarding the Mobile Infantry seems to be that every person has paid his or her dues to get in, and once a person is in, he or she is family and from that point on acts as the epitome of a citizen by putting his or her life at stake to protect the homeland. It just seems too perfect to me. Somebody mentioned in class that Starship Troopers is required reading for most of the military academies in the United States, and I can see the reasoning behind it. Soldiers are put on a pedestal in this novel and idolized. Late in the story, even Rico&#039;s father, who was completely opposed to the military, joins the Mobile Infantry because he feels that it will make his life more fulfilling. This surprise event just made Starship Troopers feel even more like a piece of propaganda, since in the end, even the most vehement opponent of the military has a change of heart and joins because it is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship Troopers just seems to be an excuse for Heinlein to spread his political views; the story exists to solely to link together the various classroom discussion sections, which is the other major aspect of the story that brought it down for me. I understand that novels are constantly used as vehicles for authors to express their philosophical and political musings - I do not object to this if the commentary is implemented well. The problem I have with Starship Troopers is that Heinlein comes off as very self-righteous to me. As I progressed through the novel, Heinlein&#039;s commentary became more and more obnoxious. He uses Dubois to express his views and he presents them as fact. Dubois is seen as this omniscient, infallible character who is always right, and it is this character who presents much of Heinlein&#039;s views. Any time the story switched to a Dubois lecture, I felt like the situation changed to where Heinlein is directly lecturing the reader about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
