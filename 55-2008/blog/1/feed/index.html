 <title>schedule changes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/308</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so as I mentioned in class today, I&#039;ve got to cancel class next Wednesday due to an emergency meeting I have to attend.  I want to propose the following options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  We spend Monday, April 21, discussing Gibson and the secondary criticism as listed on the syllabus, but I order pizza and we stay until as close to 1.15 as we possibly can, so that both Monday&#039;s and Wednesday&#039;s groups can present on Monday, and we can finish with Gibson in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  We leave Monday&#039;s class just as it&#039;s currently scheduled, and instead extend class on Monday, April 28, spending the first chunk of class on Gibson before turning to Atwood.  Pizza, ditto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  We find some time -- Friday, May 2? -- to schedule an extra class session.  Probably a pizza-oriented enticement could be arranged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please register votes (or list additional options) in the comments...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>peer review</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/292</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few notes on the peer review process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, if you don&#039;t have a partner as yet, please leave a comment on this post; there are likely other folks looking for partners to work with, too.  If we wind up with only one person who seems unpaired, I&#039;d appreciate it if a group would expand to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as you read your partner&#039;s draft, comment by hand in the margins, of course, but you should also type out a coherent general response to the paper overall.  A helpful response to your partner&#039;s draft will likely include comments on all or most of the following issues.  The list below is for your convenience; you needn&#039;t address each item one after the other, though you may do so if it makes things easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify what appears to be the present draft&#039;s thesis or overall point.  If you aren&#039;t sure exactly what it is, list the most likely possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Tell the author whether her thesis is interesting to you or not.  Does it add anything substantive to your understanding of the novel(s) in question?  If not, you might suggest ways to make the argument more interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  If, on the other hand, the overall thesis seems to you implausible, or unconvincing, or if you can see serious objections to it that the author hasn&#039;t addressed, say so, and detail why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Describe, in no more than one short paragraph, the overall argument that&#039;s advanced in support of the thesis (in other words, how the author goes about constructing her thesis).  If this seems impossible, explain why -- try to identify areas you find confusing or unclear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify two parts of the overall argument that seem comparatively strong, persuasive, or effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify two parts of the overall argument that seem comparatively weak, unpersuasive, or ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Does the author use any abstract terms or phrases whose precise meanings in the paper aren&#039;t clear to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  How well do the draft&#039;s parts fit together?  Is the author doing a good job of moving the reader coherently from one part of the argument to another?  If not, try to identify some places where you got disoriented or couldn&#039;t figure out quite where in the discussion you were.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Does the author&#039;s use of details and quotations from the primary text(s) and/or secondary sources seem effective?  Do some of the quotations seem stuck in merely to satisfy the research requirements of this assignment?  Are any quotations unnecessarily long?  Are quotations introduced well, woven smoothly into the author&#039;s own prose, or do they just seem to hang there awkwardly?  Do you know how the author interprets the key ideas of each quote she uses, and how those ideas connect to her argument?  Are the quotations correctly punctuated and cited?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Identify (in the margins of the draft if not in the letter) any basic syntactic, usage, punctuation, spelling, or typographical errors.  Since final drafts may be penalized if they contain such egregious errors, you&#039;ll be doing your partner a service by catching those errors now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  As your partner goes forward to revise this draft, give her at least two general suggestions for making the paper better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have questions...&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve got an annotated bibliography with no name on it; the paper apparently focuses on Snow Crash, and the bibliography includes Pettman, Stockton, Gardner, Wyatt, Dougherty, Haraway, and Lakoff.  Anyone care to take credit for their work?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>where to start that research?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/250</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been meaning to bring this up in class for the last week, and only today during office hours, while talking with a member of the class, did I suddenly remember:  given that many of you are science/math/otherwise non-English majors, you might want a pointer or two on how to start your research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing is this:  don&#039;t use Google Scholar; it&#039;s crap when it comes to the humanities.  And don&#039;t start with JStor -- you&#039;ll get there, but it&#039;s not the place to begin.  Begin on the library&#039;s home page (&lt;a href=&quot;http://libraries.claremont.edu&quot; title=&quot;http://libraries.claremont.edu&quot;&gt;http://libraries.claremont.edu&lt;/a&gt;, but please don&#039;t tell me if you didn&#039;t already know that), and in the center of the page, click on the &quot;most used databases&quot; drop-down menu.  What you want is the MLA Bibliography; everything published in literary and cultural studies is indexed in this bibliography, including all of the journals in JStor or Project Muse, but many, many others besides.  The MLA Bibliography also indexes articles in edited volumes, which no other electronic database will help you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:  MLA Bibliography.  Start there.  If you find yourself stuck, talk to your friendly neighborhood research librarian; Gale Burrow is the literature specialist, and she&#039;ll likely be tremendous help.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>oops</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/49</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I see that my intent to have the McHale essay posted on the syllabus in time for you to read it for tomorrow&#039;s class has been utterly foiled by my complete failure to follow through.  Read the other two essays and the Gibson, and I&#039;ll attempt to get McHale up there sometime this week.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>reading responses</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/48</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m in the process of reading and commenting upon your reading responses from last week, and wanted to give you all a few pieces of information based on my readings of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, your responses are by and large good.  Some of you could bear to go into a bit more detail in your close readings -- carefully analyzing the issue as it is represented in the text, supporting your points with demonstrated evidence from the text, or from other texts, and so forth.  Remember that these responses are meant to be the equivalent of about a one page paper.  And remember that these are supposed to be a little bit more formal than your average blog post -- you need to pay attention to the conventions of good academic writing (including grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc., but also including citation formats, diction, structure, and other issues), as I&#039;m assessing these responses both on the quality of the ideas they contain and on the clarity with which those ideas are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, on the tags:  I&#039;m cleaning up the tags we&#039;ve used so far a bit, to create a bit of consistency.  All posts must have tags, but don&#039;t overuse them -- creating too many similar tags makes things more confusing rather than more organized.  (So, for instance, we had tags like &quot;response,&quot; &quot;reading response,&quot; &quot;response 1,&quot; and &quot;ST reading response&quot;; I&#039;ve combined all of these into &quot;Response 1,&quot; so that all posts about that idea will be grouped together.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along that line, when you post your reading responses for this week, be sure to tag them &quot;Response 2&quot;.  A careful use of tags like this will help me to make sure that your reading responses are recorded properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have questions, and I&#039;ll look forward to seeing you all tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>a few reminders</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/2</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t forget to create your account here, and once I&#039;ve approved it, make sure you post something (anything) before class on Monday, just to make sure everything&#039;s working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: you&#039;ll notice that our links block in the sidebar is pretty slight -- let me know if you have sites that I should add links to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:  the thing that I was trying to remember in class today, that I had wanted to say but had temporarily forgotten, was my spoiler caveat.  In previous semesters, I divided the reading fairly strictly by day, and worked pretty hard to keep spoilers out of the classroom, so that those who read more quickly wouldn&#039;t give things away to the rest of the class.  This semester, as an experiment, I&#039;m saying the heck with that: we&#039;re going to talk about the entire novel, more or less, from the get-go, focusing on different issues rather than different sections on each of the days we discuss it.  Which means that there will be spoilers galore, so if you care about such things, try to make sure you&#039;ve finished the novel before the first day we discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you Monday...&lt;/p&gt;
