 <title>Anarchy in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/275</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The political world in Snow Crash resembles that of an organized anarchy.  We only get a real sense of what the governmental situation in America is like, but we know that the federal government completely collapsed.  The American dollar experienced hyper inflation similar to that of Germany in the early 1920&#039;s, to the point of where trillion dollar bills were almost worthless.  The role of the federal government has been reduced to the equivalent of an overly proud company that thinks it is way more important than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political system that arises resembles organized anarchy, for there is no true law, no inalienable rights, no justice system to protect a newborn child.  However there are rules and protection services offered through the individual franchulates.  This system of franchises combines with the free anarchy left with the disappearance to form a very capitalism rooted form of anarchy.  The different franchulates actually compete and advertise, whether in the real world or the metaverse, for citizens to come join.  Different franchulates carve out specific niches for their customers, such as the New South Africa franchise which offers genetic purity for the stereotypical southern white male.  Company wars manifest themselves in actual gang wars, such as the war depicted between the mafia owned Nova Sicilia and Narcolombia franchises.  This system, just like economic capitalism, leads to large powerful franchises such as Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong, and much smaller specialized franchises such and CosaNostra Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting parallel to the Anarchy system in the continental United States is found on the raft.  One quote in particular shows this on page 387: &quot;The worst thing that can happen on the Raft is for your neighborhood to get cut loose.  That&#039;s why the raft is such a tangled mess.  Each neighborhood is afraid that the neighboring &#039;hoods are going to gang up on them, cut them loose, leave them to starve in the middle of the Pacific.  So they are constantly finding new ways to tie themselves into each other...&quot;  the raft mirrors anarchy in that there again is no law or inherent rights obtained just by being a part of the raft.  It is a cutthroat, free-for-all society in which any member could get screwed over and not be able to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the Oankali save the human race from extinction, it does not justify their manipulation and subordination of the species afterwards.  Now admittedly, if the Oankali had not come along, the human race would be dead, gone, no more people to stand around and be proud to represent what is &quot;human&quot;.  However, to be brought back with little control over your major life choices, with often the only alternative being suicide, is not a great second option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were not given the pretext that the Oankali saved the human race, there would be no doubt of their immorality (at least by our standards).  For the majority of the story, the humans are held on &quot;ships&quot;, and not allowed to go back to Earth until they have proven themselves loyal.  The Oankali maximize their slavery by making the human race entirely dependent upon Oankali for reproduction.  The humans who do escape and form resistance colonies are filled with sterile, desperate humans.  In Adulthood Rites there is finally a &quot;compromise&quot; which involves sending a pure human colony to Mars, but this does not give the humans a much more desirable situation.  If we were told of a race that would capture all humans, sterilize them, mate with them, and as a compromise send the only colony of fertile humans to Mars, I don&#039;t think their would be much argument over how justifiable that is.  The fact that the enslavement prevented the death of the species does not change the fact that it is enslavement.  As I pointed out in a recent comment, a good moral action does not justify a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would even cast doubt on how &quot;good&quot; the action of saving the human race was in the first place.  It seems to me that it was more of a coincidence of sorts that it was good moral action, for the Oankali were not rescuing humans because they felt it was the right thing to do, they captured humans for their own genetic purposes.  If instead the human race was about to fly off to some other galaxy all at once, the Oankali could have very well done the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oankali&#039;s actions cannot be justified morally, even if they are to be interpreted as advantageous to the human race.  The basics for our morals lie in the right to make a choice.  If I do something to you that others or I interpret as being ultimately beneficial without giving you a choice or asking your opinion, it is immoral.  It might not always get an objection, such as when Lilith learns how her cancer was removed, but it always warrants one, such as the resistors.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The future of the book (google talk)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So i attended the talk about the &quot;Googlization of Everything&quot; by Siva Vaidhyanathan, and wanted to comment on an issue which he addressed, and implied that other speakers had also addressed throughout the day.  That issue is what exactly will happen to the paper book in the future?  I have frequently had this argument with friends at home, and my stance is that the book will decline in popularity to the point that it is only used as a novelty item.  It seems that as more an more is loaded onto the internet, that books will inevitably follow the same path music is and become completely digital, with only a few exceptions.  &quot;Google book&quot; was an example I would site, but Siva examined the processes behind Google book, and seemed to show how its not as close as we like to think it is to being a universal library.  Searches will often bring up obscure texts, and it has yet to come close to the filtration level that an actual librarian can provide.  Also having a search engine determine how we find all of our information can be a very dangerous thing, for if it determines a text to be unimportant then it could disappear forever as &quot;result 10,453 out of 50,000&quot;.  Another interesting point was on how Google forms profiles on its users, and tailors its search results to what it interprets that user is looking for.  An easy situation to imagine in which this could be corrupted would be if a user&#039;s profile labels him or her as a political extremist one way or another, and then filters results to only include points of view that fit within that political extremism, perhaps preventing that person from branching out.  It seems that a universal library is not nearly as easy to compile responsibly as I thought&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Limits of the Imagination</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/149</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ursula Le Guin paints a world in her book &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, that is almost impossible to imagine, and that&#039;s what makes it so interesting.  Le Guin&#039;s alien world of Gethen is one of perpetual winter, filled with a people much like our own.  The primary difference between our species and theirs is that they are all of a neutral sex, with the exception of a few days a month, where they decide which sex they want to be.  This difference seems silly, and almost impossible to us, for the duality of male and female is so ingrained in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the main alien character, Estraven, is first seen, it is in the context of a large parade with the nation of Karhide&#039;s king.  A &quot;king&quot; that is without, and with no desire for, a queen.  Estraven serves as the sort of &quot;right hand man&quot; of the king, giving advice to Genly, the male protagonist earthling.  It is virtually impossible for us to imagine these characters initially as anything but male.  There is absolutely nothing resembling sexual tension between Genly and Estraven in their early interactions, and it seems no different than any interaction between two males.  The social positions occupied by many of the characters are those that we would typically associate with male, such as a &quot;king&quot;, and so we have to constantly remind ourselves that the characters are actually gender-neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Guin&#039;s use of masculine pronouns for all the characters makes it even harder to break out of the normal male image.  This appears to be an issue Le Guin was trying to avoid, as a future short story called &quot;The Winter&#039;s King&quot; about the same world was published with both all male, and later with all female pronouns.  However, the decision to use &quot;he&quot;, no matter its intentions, again forces the reader to constantly remind themselves of the true gender neutrality of the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologically it is easy to understand why it would be so hard for people to grasp this concept.  If I asked you to think of images of ten different women, and then of ten different men, it would not be a difficult task.  However, if I were to ask you to picture ten different gender-neutral people, it would not be easy at all.  The concept of being both and neither gender at the same time is like nothing we encounter in our everyday lives.  Le Guin challenges us to imagine an alien race that is just like us, and yet far from us at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if it wasn&#039;t hard enough to imagine how the humanoid aliens looked, their lack of gender comes along with a lack of sexual drive.  Le Guin seems to tie this lack of sex drive to other properties of the culture, such as its slow technological advancement, and its utter lack of wars, of even the word war.  Lets be honest, no sex drive, technology rush or war? Sounds like a pretty boring world.  The inhabitants of Gethen lack the motivation to improve their technology past what they believe they need, as shown with their centuries old heater design, which could easily be improved upon, but it is felt that it is good enough.  Video games will never be as good as they could be, and cars will never be as energy efficient as possible.  The satiety with life is a concept that humans cannot relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of Gethen is similar to ours on the surface, but radically different underneath it.  Le Guin challenges our imaginations like no other author I have ever read, and sheds light on just how ingrained some concepts, such as sex, are.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Plausibility of Gilead</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/112</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Margaret Atwood describes a world in Handmaid&#039;s Tale that seems to be exaggerated to make a point, and not a realistic possibility.  However, a closer look at the psychology behind such cultures reveals it is not as out of the question as we may presume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misconception by people is their self-perceived immunity to manipulation.  In 1961 Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram performed one of the most controversial, and interesting, experiments of the century.  His experiment was run three months after the start of a Nazi war criminal, and was designed to determine how much the Nazi&#039;s were individually responsible for the horrors that they committed during the war.  The basic set up of the experiment involved the subject being told they were studying the effects of punishment on thinking, and were told to shock another participant (really an actor), with increasingly higher voltages until a correct answer was produced.  The experiment runner, who sat near the participant and served as the authority figure, proposed the questions.  The voltage went as high as 450 volts, and long before that the actor would be yelling from the other room in pain and complaining of possible serious complications from heart problems.  When Milgram polled his colleagues before the experiment, they believed that only the vilest people would go all the way (an average of 1.2%).  The actual results were astounding, in that 65% of participants went to 450 volts, although many of them protested while they were doing so.  The reason so many commited this seemingly horrid task was the influence of the experimenter in the room, who told repeated only four lines when the participants complained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Please continue.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The experiment requires that you continue.&lt;br /&gt;
3. It is absolutely essential that you continue.&lt;br /&gt;
4. You have no other choice, you must go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experiment has been run many more times, with separate variables adjusted.  The most critical variable by far has been shown to be the perceived presence an authority held by the experimenter urging them to go on.  Although peer conformity has been shown to have a strong effect, for when it was run with a &quot;dummy&quot; teacher running the supposed same experiment next to the participant and the &quot;dummy&quot; went all the way with the experiment, only 3 of 40 subjects stopped before the end, meaning it is incredibly hard to resist society like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the implications of this experiment are obviously huge, and go a long way in explaining how an entire country could go on a genocide campaign.  It also explains how a world such as Gilead could stay in power, with half its people oppressed.  The &quot;authority figure&quot; in Gilead is represented by the government, which although it isn&#039;t seen outright often, as we mentioned in class this can be much more oppressing than an overt government like in the movie.  The government is perceived to have infiltrated everyday life with their &quot;eyes&quot;, and so it is difficult to even talk about resistance.  Disobedience has obvious consequences, as shown by the hangings of &quot;criminals&quot;:  &quot;They have committed atrocities and must be made into examples, for the rest.  Though this is hardly needed.  No woman in her right mind, these days, would seek to prevent a birth, should she be so lucky as to conceive&quot;(33).  The level of authority held by the government rivals that of Nazi Germany, and so I would argue that the men in the book are no less responsible for the catastrophe than the women, and that a lack of action by any one of them does not necessarily constitute a weak character, but just a lack of an exceptionally strong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes for Offred too.  Her lack of resistance in the first half of the book does not in any way make her weak, and her actions in the second half, such as playing scrabble and having sex with Nick, I believe are much more indicative of a strong character than we first assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was also mentioned in class, Atwood has discussed how the roots of Gilead come from other societies that have, or currently do exist.  The situations in some middle-eastern countries have very similar parallels in their oppression of women, and show that it is not that out of the question for it to occur.  I believe distopian books are very important not just for the sake of whatever message they present, like the gender equality statements of &quot;Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot;, but so that we can be reminded of our susceptibility to authority, and avoid a distopia of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
