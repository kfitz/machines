 <title>A Different Post-Apocalyptic Lifestyle</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/353</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While Snowman, as many people have pointed out, has a very grim life ahead of him, I found James Cole&#039;s life in 12 Monkeys considerably more disturbing. He experiences just about everything that could go wrong in a dystopian future: his life is manipulated by far more powerful people, he loses his grip on what is real and believes himself to be insane, and ultimately becomes a witness to his own death. As with many time-travelers, he is ultimately helpless in the past even though he has such extensive knowledge of it; Cole&#039;s story employs the Cassandra myth to find tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tragedy of the film occurs when Cole realizes that his recurring dream is linked to his childhood, and that as a child he witnessed his own death at the airport. Here, even his personal memory of the past has failed him, and his life takes on a sort-of ouroboros configuration, where his final moments are taken in by his childhood-self, who will then go on to perform exactly the same actions decades later that will place him in the airport again. As finales go in time-travel movies, I think this is one of the most effective and disturbing tragedies possible; while time-travel movies may end up with the hero having to sacrifice himself to maintain the timeline (e.g. Donnie Darko, Terminator 2), here the character condemns his life to an endless cycle of helplessness and tragedy. We naturally think of time as linear, which is what makes time-travel movies such fun escapism; when the hero dies at the end, in some ways this returns us to a linear conception of their timeline, with a definite beginning and end. Here, Cole does not leave us with this satisfaction, and the murkiness of his timeline (and sanity and top of that) is unsettling, effective, and a unique comment on time-travel&#039;s complex effect on the lives of its users.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The End of the Past and Seeing Beyond</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/336</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I was a bit confused about why The Matrix was our movie to watch with Pattern Recognition, but having thought about it I think there are two major themes that run through both works, though Pattern Recognition clearly tries to stay grounded roughly in the present, while The Matrix extrapolates them to  far more extreme situations. Both works, though, demonstrate the key challenges of defining history, through a character&#039;s ability to &quot;see beyond&quot; reality to some hidden truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that Pattern Recognition is in large part a response to 9/11, and Gibson clearly considers that event a major demarcation of history into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;. To this end, the many cultural references Gibson makes to technology and fashion serve to ground the world&#039;s chronology in a very exact and careful way; while some critics claimed that Gibson&#039;s style in this book would &quot;date&quot; it, this is in fact exactly what he must do to make his point. He is emphasizing that as of now, we cannot tie our culture back to the one of a few years prior, and thus our only way of defining the world is to use whatever cultural markers we have today. The rupture in cultural development has set us adrift, and we have only the most trivial methods of defining ourselves. This &quot;rupture&quot; is immediately obvious in the Matrix as well, where all of human experience hit an abrupt &quot;reset&quot; button, when the world simply became an endless computer simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response to this rupture and lack of total comprehension is a character who understands reality, albeit intuitively rather than consciously, on a deeper level, to see the hidden machinery that most people accept blindly. Cayse and Neo are both heroes in these worlds because they can somehow tap into the forces of the world that would otherwise hinder them: Cayse the cultural flow of trends and fashions, Neo the computer code of the Matrix. While they cannot return to the pre-rupture world, they are nonetheless able to ground themselves in some deeper reality while most people are simply floating through a world newly separated from its own history.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Labyrinth of Existenz</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/278</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than talk about the many, many sexual metaphors and images that pop up in Existenz, I&#039;d like to talk about the film in terms of narrative, and its particular brand of alternate reality. This movie was certainly not helped by being released around the same time of the Matrix, since they cover somewhat similar ground, but Existenz is a quiet, low-budget, semi-incoherent techno-horror movie, and the Matrix is the Matrix. But, as alternate realities go, I think Existenz brings up a point that no other book or movie has yet about alternate reality: what if you can&#039;t tell which reality you&#039;re in? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, the Matrix sort of brought up this idea, but it was made pretty clear once people started dodging bullets which was reality and which was manipulable simulation. In fact, Neuromancer and Snow Crash also carry this idea that the mark of the &quot;real world&quot; is a certain powerlessness to natural laws (e.g. gravity); Case diving through 3-dimensional space and Hiro writing code to define the Black Sun are how we know they are in virtual reality. So we come to Existenz, where entering virtual reality give you no superpowers, or really any major distinction between where you were pre- and post-bioport plugging (aside from a narrative shift, which I&#039;ll get to). In fact, (spoilers alert), it&#039;s not even made clear which, if any, parts of the movie take place in reality, so the audience isn&#039;t even given a stable starting point to try and trace the journey between the virtual and the real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cronenberg does seem to offer a brief glimmer of hope, though, in that the narrative of the film seems to devolve as the characters go &quot;deeper&quot; into the game. The story began with a fairly standard plotline--a failed assassination on Character A, who goes on the run with Character B, who doesn&#039;t want to get dragged into all of this.  Willem Defoe&#039;s character is the first indication that this narrative may not be &quot;naturally occurring&quot; in the real world, but is a construction, since the coincidence that Allegra and Pikul would run into a gas station owner who has exactly what they need to advance the story line is a little too remarkable. As the story continues, they enter a game within a game, objects and characters pop up in the wrong &quot;narrative level&quot; (e.g. the tooth gun that was used to shoot Allegra in the first scene pops up again when they are supposedly in the game&#039;s Chinese Restaurant). The film ends with a &quot;realist revolution&quot;, multiple character deaths, and no real explanation of what&#039;s going on. By constructing his film this way, Cronenberg has done with narrative what Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and the Matrix did with surpassing the laws of reality: demonstrated the split between real and virtual. But, the closing scene offers a comprehensive and total &quot;gotcha!&quot; to the audience who think they have finally figured out where the line is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it seems like the &quot;It was all a dream&quot; cop-out, with everyone waking up from their Transcendenz headsets, sans spine-sphincters, laughing about how ridiculous that whole story about Existenz was. But, the closing line of the movie, and a couple of visual cues demonstrate that the game may be able to simulate nice, quiet reality just as effectively as the chaotic, excessive mess we&#039;ve seen for the past hour and a half. Regardless of whether or not you think they&#039;re still in the game at the end of the movie, you still have to force yourself to believe one or the other, because both seem equally plausible. This is ultimately where Cronenberg uses virtual reality to properly pull out the rug, because we finally understand that the distinction between real and virtual will be truly invalid if the real can be perfectly simulated. The notion of &quot;nested realities&quot; becomes terrifying if they are indistinguishable, because there is no way of knowing which is genuine. Even if we think we&#039;ve hit &quot;File&amp;gt;Quit&quot;, or unplugged, or taken off the high-def goggles, there&#039;s no assurance that that too is not just another simulation. Or, to take another tack, if they&#039;re indistinguishable, does it matter if we&#039;re in the real world or not?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Plague Hits WoW</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/253</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In case anyone wanted more information on the disease that spread through World of Warcraft, here&#039;s the official BBC article about it:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm&quot; title=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm&quot;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4272418.stm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some experts discussing the practicality of modeling disease in a virtual world:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm&quot; title=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm&quot;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6951918.stm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m amused the second one is actually in the &quot;Health&quot; section of BBC, rather than &quot;Technology&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tank Girl v. Barbarella</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/248</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious if anybody has any thoughts on the similarities and differences between Tank Girl and Barbarella -- the fact that they were both originally comic book characters got me started on this line of thought. Both seem to be a fairly extreme extrapolation of a certain notion of a strong female character; Tank Girl seems to operate through violence and general social domination, while Barbarella is, essentially, sex (though with the numerous shots of Tank Girl astride her tank&#039;s gun, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some overlap between the two). Both also seem to be products of their time periods, Tank Girl embodying the punk aesthetic of the late 80s/early 90s, and Barbarella building on the sex kitten/Birgitte Bardot idea of sexuality in the 60s. The shift between the two seems quite interesting to me, with Barbarella being the idealized product of her society, while Tank Girl is completely detached from societal standards. If anyone has a more lucid analysis, I&#039;d like to hear it; I just wrapped up the movie and haven&#039;t had time to properly collect all my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose the &quot;Joyce of science fiction&quot; review on the back should have been a warning, but I really thought I could make sense of this book. Maybe Cyteen will make up in clarity what it clearly lacks in brevity...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Different Direction for Darwin</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/165</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As we were talking about the role of genetics as well as how to determine some notion of species-based superiority (&quot;should humanity cede their future to the Oankali&quot; being one of the key discussions in these books), I started to realize that watching Alien would be an excellent avenue to have a similar discussion but in a very different direction. The xenomorph is an interesting counterpoint to the Oankali, because one can make many of the same arguments from Lilith&#039;s Brood about biological superiority, yet the arguments sound somewhat more preposterous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Oankali, the xenomorph&#039;s reproduction involves humans, albeit in a considerably more violent way--the Oankali constructs do not burst their way through the chest of their parents. The key distinction, of course, is that reproduction is essentially all the xenomorphs do with their lives, lacking all other signs of intelligent life. Since aliens are often defined by their supposed &#039;superiority&#039; in some way to humans (everything from the logic of the Vulcans to the enormous city-ships in Independence Day), the xenomorphs represent a species whose superiority is for once completely distinct from the intellect. As Ian Holm&#039;s character states, the alien is &quot;a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the xenomorph is &quot;superior&quot;, as we like to phrase it, to humanity in the arena of physicality, but the deep and fundamental questions that we&#039;ve been asking ourselves about humanity and the Oankali seem to just bounce off this alien species as ridiculous. Why is it that when we read about the Oankali&#039;s advanced science, we start thinking that maybe we&#039;ve had a good run and its time to toss in the towel, but when we see the Alien ripping through people, climbing on walls, and spraying acidic blood, we just cross our fingers that Ripley will find some way of killing this thing? Why do we consider intellectual evolution as a force beyond our control, but physical evolution is just a reason to design a bigger gun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. As an additional fun avenue of discussion, there&#039;s a quote from Ximena Gallardo, who wrote a book called &quot;Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley&quot; that I thought someone might want to run with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It [the xenomorph] subdues and opens the male body to make it pregnant, and then explodes it in birth. In its adult form, the alien strikes its victims with a rigid phallic tongue that breaks through skin and bone. More than a phallus, however, the retractable tongue has its own set of snapping metallic teeth that connects it to the castrating vagina dentata&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Interpreting an Origin Myth</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/146</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to talk about the Orgota Creation Myth (p.237), because I think the origin myth that a genetically engineered people come up with is an interesting notion (and one that you could only pull off in sci-fi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I find it interesting that there is neither a single omnipotent God figure, nor the dual Adam and Eve figures, but rather 3 &quot;creator&quot; figures. Perhaps the idea here is to emphasize that what we see as &quot;no gender&quot; is in fact its own gender, so while we see the people of Winter as oscillating between androgyny and the male/female binary, the people see themselves (through their myth) as having 3 distinct states of being. It&#039;s worth noting that the 3 creators have 3 responses that could be ascribed to our own conceptions of the genders of Winter. &quot;I bleed&quot; and &quot;I weep&quot; could be seen as representing violence and emotion, which are generally split along the male/female binary (though if you really started analyzing bodily fluids as metaphors, you might see the two switching roles), while &quot;I sweat&quot; implies a purely physical response to the world, devoid of gender or sexuality. I think its impressive that LeGuin is capable of using language at its least flowery, as most myths demand, to still get across the complex sexuality (or gender, whatever the proper term is) of Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is also not without its interesting quirks. It is the first man, not the creators, who force snow and winter upon the world. The first man also kills 37 of the 39 people the creators made, which seems unusual for a world that cannot conceive of war (although personal violence is not quite as challenging a concept). Then the story ends by breaking a few major taboos--a house of corpses, and brotherly love in the most literal sense (and interesting companion piece to Chapter 2 on p. 22). Also, as we are all focused on the binaries and duality of the story, the myth ends with a declaration that the people of Winter find themselves in &quot;the middle of time&quot; (239), with shadows (I think blacklace went into some detail on this particular topic) reminding them of the eventual destruction of light and the permanence of winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, there seems to be a substantial commentary on the perception of sexuality of the people. On one hand, the three states of being are all seen as equally important towards creating the world; on the other hand, kemmering is referred to as &quot;burning&quot; (by corpses, no less), and the general species is born out of incest, which would imply that sex is not seen as a pure act by any means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other aspects of the story (inherent violence, avoiding the binary with respect to time) also merit discussion, I&#039;m sure, but I find the somewhat contradictory roles of sexuality and gender seem particularly interesting (even more so since they appear in an origin myth meant to summarize the entire culture).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cuaron should make Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/106</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As we keep discussing Hollywood&#039;s destruction of some of the books we&#039;ve read, I feel like I should mention that there&#039;s apparently a movie being made of Neuromancer, starring everyone&#039;s favorite emo-Jedi, Hayden Christensen, as Case, and directed by Joseph Kahn, who has offered us such masterpieces as Britney Spears&#039; video for &quot;Toxic&quot;. Hooray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because as I was rewatching Children of Men, I started thinking that the approach of Cuaron and his cinematographer is exactly what I would want in a film adaptation of Neuromancer. Children of Men is one of the most subjective movies I&#039;ve seen in recent memory--essentially every scene is built around Theo and our understanding of the scenes is as complete or limited as Theo&#039;s own. The world is minutely defined , yet the overwhelming detail and description with which it is given often makes it almost incomprehensible. At times, it recalls our world, yet at others seems incredibly foreign, and is immersed in an environment of despair and hopelessness that it feels oppressive at times. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s much of a stretch, though, to say this summarizes Neuromancer as well as Children of Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, the construction of the world in Children of Men resembles Gibson&#039;s own approach. Much of the world is seen briefly or peripherally, and we are not always given a complete explanation of what we&#039;re seeing. In Children of Men, I was struck by the fact that the special effects, which so many movies love to focus on, are here relegated to the background or seen so briefly as to be almost pointless. They are used not to call attention to anything, but are rather submerged in the deluge of visuals. When used in this way, they serve not as a means of forcing the audience to accept the reality of the world on the screen, but to transition between our world and the movie. The opening scene is an excellent example of this &quot;transition&quot;-based use of special effects (and the long single-shot that is used a lot in this movie). We begin in a coffee shop indistinguishable from the modern day, see from the date on the screen that we are in fact in 2027, and then as Theo steps outside, we see double-decker buses and whole buildings covered with enormous television screens. As he walks down the street, we are given such a deluge of  visual information that this world is &quot;different&quot; from our own, that we aren&#039;t fully capable of defining each individual part, and simply accept it as a whole (Granted, this may just be my experience of the movie, but it&#039;s my post, so there). Then, an explosion, acting almost as a period at the end of the sentence, calls attention to the transition that we have just undergone in a single shot that&#039;s less than a minute long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost exactly how Gibson offers his cyberpunk world to the reader--in the background or in fleeting glimpses. Consider descriptions like &quot;Someone scored a ten-megaton hit on Tank War Europa, a simulated airburst drowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball mushroomed overhead.&quot; (17), or &quot;Case turned his head and tried to make out the outline of the old Orly terminals, but the shuttle pad was screened by graceful blast-deflectors of wet concrete. The one nearest the window bore an Arabic slogan in red spraybomb.&quot; (102). Gibson clearly uses the fringes of the environments that he creates to distinguish them from our world, and while it may seem odd to try and say that a literary and visual style are similar, I do think that Children of Men and Neuromancer share an approach to establishing a world (I think those two descriptions of Gibson&#039;s could just as easily be descriptions of deleted scenes from Children of Men, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to disagree, as I&#039;m sure some people found the movie boring, needlessly artsy, show-offy, or lacking plot and a conclusion (all things my friends have said about it). But as we wait for the Neuromancer trailer to no doubt give us a blistering techno soundtrack, incredible special effects that make the Matrix come alive, fun one-liners that sound great even out of context, and other such standards of sci-fi adaptations, I&#039;m going to stick with Children of Men for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed that seems to characterize cyberpunk is a constant sense of despair. When the limits of biology and existence itself are stretched and reshaped, it&#039;s not surprising that religious notions of the soul and higher planes of existence become less and less meaningful. Most of the technological advancements in the book seem sacrilegious in some way;  when Case is jacked into Molly&#039;s consciousness, there are two beings residing in one body, Dixie&#039;s existence demonstrates that human consciousness doesn&#039;t require flesh, and Wintermute creates Armitage just as effectively as the basic principles of biology created Corto. Some of the basic assumptions of human existence have been challenged, thanks to miraculous scientific development, and there is effectively nothing to look up to (did anyone find a mention of anything resembling a church in the book?). Blade Runner seemed to make this point a bit more explicitly (very subtle symbolism as Batty dies at the end, I thought), so I thought I&#039;d bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly religious imagery pops up here and there. Part of the burlesque replicant&#039;s introduction is &quot;Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent... that once corrupted man.&quot;, and Batty ascends to the top of the skyscraper to destroy the man who created him, after he has proved his intellect (the man happens to be wearing all white, for some reason). Blade Runner seems to offer a universe where Neuromancer&#039;s technologically-based demystification of humanity has reached its apex, and people simply create more people, building in a finite lifespan for good measure, and inventing a test so they can know who they are (interestingly, an &quot;empathy test&quot;, as Tyrell summarizes it). And once memories get involved, and the distinction becomes less and less apparent, the only separation that seems valid is the religiously-motivated one, that while the end result may be the same, the way in which life was brought into the universe must have some bearing on the value of that life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs notes version: When the boundaries that are stretched in a science fiction novel are not physical and spatial (spaceships, faster-than-light travel, etc.), but biological and existential, you&#039;re destined to end up with some pretty messed up characters.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Science Fiction and Parody</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/37</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While I think various people have commented by now on the (numerous) ways that the movie and the book approach the subject material differently (to be diplomatic), I have a  slightly more general topic I&#039;d like to discuss. We were asked to consider if the movie could in fact be a parody of the book in some way, and there&#039;s certainly evidence to that effect. However, after skimming Wikipedia and IMDB (research purists commence eye-rolling), I noticed that the director explicitly stated on the DVD commentary that he never finished the book after the first few chapters, becoming &quot;bored and depressed.&quot; While that doesn&#039;t single-handedly deny the possibility that some awareness of the book was brought to the film-making, it certainly doesn&#039;t support the idea of the film as parody.&lt;br /&gt;
But, as I was thinking about it, I started to think more generally about what would constitute a &quot;science fiction parody&quot; and it seemed surprisingly hard to pin down--the only thing that came to mind at all was Douglas Adams&#039; Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide. While both styles/genres have some external construction of a fictional setting meant to help demonstrate some underlying truth of our own reality, the two seem quite opposed in terms of methodology. While any specific definition will inevitably draw counter-examples and nitpicking, I think it&#039;s safe to say that science fiction requires of its authors a commitment to a rational explanation for the world they create; in fact, those explanatory threads that link back to our own understanding end up being the way that we can identify with a world so distinct from our own. On the other hand, parodies seem to have some amount of absurdity or irony--their purpose is actually to attack the rational reality of another work. It seems like it would be quite challenging to somehow make a parodic science fiction setting because you would have to simultaneously be expressing rationality and absurdity, and the reader would be left with detailed laws, histories, and science that somehow create a world that is entirely metaphorical or symbolic.&lt;br /&gt;
While I freely acknowledge that posts at 1 A.M. may not be the most lucid (and I think I may have started overlapping parody with satire in my head), I&#039;m curious if anyone else has any thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
