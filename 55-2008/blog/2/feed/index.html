 <title>ChickieNobs, PETA, and Crake.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/350</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Crake is an extremely interesting character in the novel, even more so after the discussion we had in class about him being a mad scientist/super genius.  Personally, I think he is a mad scientist, because he took the route that, in his view, promotes &#039;the greater good&#039;, with the end justifying the means.  But past this, I think what he did is something that anyone is capable of doing, given the circumstances.  He is extremely intelligent, and gets the best education; he has the drive to see his projects through, and develops the ego necessary to completely believe in his vision.  What I want to know though, it how he developed both the lack of empathy he shows towards not only the animals he experiments on, but also the countless people he kills as well.  It is this lack of care that places him beyond the usual clichÃ© of the scientist mistreating the animals he or she is experimenting on; he obviously cares for the planet.  His whole mission is to stop the pollution, influence, etc., that he thinks humans continue to cause just by existing.&lt;br /&gt;
	I remember it being brought up in class that PETA is offering a reward for anyone who can create a Petri-grown chicken substitute; perhaps this is the view that Crake takes, especially in regard to the ChickieNobs.  If I remember, he says it is easier to just imagine them as sea anemones.  Since they are not &#039;real&#039; animals, they do not deserve the same protections as animals.  On a side note, I wonder about how PETA will react to large-scale, perfect-genotype cloning, if we even get that far.  Will they offer the same protections to these animals (since they are animals in every since except their conception) as they do to &#039;normal&#039; animals?  If anyone knows, I would like to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;
	But back to ChickieNobs, with the disgust and revulsion I feel for the ChickieNobs organisms, I wonder if I could justify killing them.  This is too similar to the stance Crake takes; could I kill these things for the greater good, for their own good, without any way of getting their own opinions?  I still think Crake is at fault for being a part of their creation, but I think we have to be careful in condemning him and undoing his work, as we may end up being just as arrogant as he in thinking we are justified in killing them.  They are alive, if not completely sentient, and we harvest their products at constant detriment to themselves, (though the same things can be said about honeybees.  It is a tricky subject to approach, and one just can&#039;t say, &quot;Better they were never created at all,&quot; since it is all to easy to say that, by the amount of destruction and mayhem humanity has caused throughout its existence, we deserve the same fate.  Perhaps this is where Crake go this idea in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Movies in Pattern Recognition.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/332</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One element of Pattern Recognition that struck me was the use of movie titles or directors in descriptions of both people and places in the novel.  While I did not enjoy the novel much as a whole, I liked how Gibson included these contemporary tidbits of information.  It really helped clear up some of the environments that Cayce was in, and gave the novel a more realistic narrative feel.  I noticed references to The Matrix and to female characters in general in most role-playing games on page 187. And to director Ridley Scott&#039;s sets on page 248.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first, Cayce&#039;s description of Marina, wearing &quot;whatâ€¦is this season&#039;s Prada exclusively, everything black&quot; and looking like she is &quot;Caucasian in some primordial, geological sense&quot; immediately brings black-leathered, pale angular-faced Trinity to mind, even without the direct Matrix reference.  It fits in well with the feelings of &#039;soul-delay&#039; and wide-ranging unreality that Cayce is experiencing here.  Adding to this, Cayce then asserts that, &quot;if her boobs were bigger, she could get work on the covers of role-playing games for adolescent boys of any age whatever.&quot;  I thought this was a hilarious statement, having often shaken my head at the ridiculous proportions and clothes some of the cover woman on those types of games have.  One simple Google search of Everquest, with no mention of cleavage or feminine attributes whatsoever came up with this image including both World of Warcraft and Everquest woman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&quot;&gt;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This brought back memories of our class discussions on the first Street Samurai badass Molly in Neuromancer as well.  It is almost as though Gibson is making a parody of Molly here, with her leather pants and dangerous, attractive body.&lt;br /&gt;
	The last reference to Ridley Scott brings up a wealth of science fiction scenes to mind, not the least of which are Blade Runner and Alien.  The &quot;sunlight, shafting dramatically in through a few small holes {in the ceiling]â€¦giving the space the look of a Ridley Scott set&quot; sets the mood for the odd conversation between Cayce and Baranov very well.  The dark, cigarette smoke-filled is transformed with this element included, conjuring images of spotlights illuminating a dirty, futuristic Los Angeles street, or of patches of light shining through the floor grates and air ducts of the Nostromo.  The mood becomes that much more sinister and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>(disjointed) Snow Crash/ eXistenZ response.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/263</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had serious trouble organizing my thoughts while writing this, partly from confusion induced after watching eXistenZ, but here are a few of my thoughts the movie and book together.&lt;br /&gt;
	The difference that I saw in between eXistenZ and Snow Crash was in the great divergence between both the means of entering the Metaverse vs. eXistenZ and the nature of the physical and moral dilemmas that both sides face.  Snow Crash had both viral and moral dilemmas in the Snow Crash virus itself and the underlying religious purposes behind it.  eXistenZ had the moral problem of substituting an entirely realistic &#039;false&#039; world for the real one, in a fashion very near to The Matrix, and the corporeal problems of the creation and use of the different &#039;game pods.&#039;  However, unlike The Matrix, in eXistenZ, it was largely impossible to discover who indeed were the &#039;good guys&#039; and the &#039;bad guys.&#039;  The mix of never knowing what was or wasn&#039;t reality and everyone having different, rapidly changing motives gave this a mystical depth that I think surpasses that of both Snow Crash and The Matrix.&lt;br /&gt;
	To the Realists in eXistenZ, the world that the game programmers create (if they even exist at all) is a threat to morality in that not only does it make the real world less important, it gives its players a world in which there is no real consequence for their actions short of &#039;losing&#039; the game.  This parallels the moral standpoint of video games making players more violent, but to such a realistic extent as to make the &#039;real&#039; violence and the &#039;game&#039; violence indistinguishable.  A sort of paradox similar to the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy is created for the player, in that whatever they think they are doing by their own free will is in fact merely advancing the plot line.  For example, when Jude Law stands up in the Chinese restaurant and yells, &quot;eXistenZ is paused!&quot; he appears to wake up in the room they entered the game from, when in fact later we learn they have only shifted scenes within the game.  I suppose what I am trying to get at here is that since the players can never be sure they are out of the game or not, they can go one of two routes.  They can act as they would in real life, not doing anything major to disrupt the social structure, or they can act on impulse and do as they please (i.e., shoot the waiter.)&lt;br /&gt;
 	After watching eXistenZ, I attempted to think of anything that would seem as weird to people in the past as the game pods appears to us, and I honestly could not think of anything close.  There are similarities in robot prosthetics, but even then, only some of our most advanced prosthetics can use our own nervous systems to recreate natural movements as close to our own, and none can draw all of their power from the body itself as the pods do.  They struck me as technically nothing more than parasites or symbiotic organisms to the human body, only without even any function on their own.  No free will, no purposeful movement; only memory storage.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Slow River Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/242</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest questions of morality I saw (and the class talked about) was how Lore never acknowledges the other side of the monopoly argument.  As far as she is concerned, since the van de Oest products are superior to the others, they have the right to dominate the market.  As the son of two educators from a middleclass family, this was about as opposite my thought patterns as possible. The grand revelation she has about her family&#039;s rise to monopoly was all focused on the corruption behind it, not on the nature of the monopoly itself.  This was even after all of her work with Spanner and at the water-purification facility.  The way that Hepple acts is nearly identical to the way the younger Lore reacts to the worker problems on the Russia job, and to her own mother&#039;s response to the families of the children crippled by mistakes in the purification systems.  Between having a peon-level job and having such a money-grubbing, careless boss as Hepple,  I would have thought she would come to revise her opinion of her family&#039;s methods at least a little.  But no, the fault was in Hepple not choosing the expensive superior brand, not the producer&#039;s fault in making the bacteria absolutely dependent on one set of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  After all of her time spent on money schemes with Spanner, it surprised me that she would be naÃ¯ve enough to never recognize how much of a chokehold this kind of production has on the market.  I would say that she believed that her family would never stoop so low as to extort their buyers unjustly, but the way she herself describes her family&#039;s instabilities and lack of empathy rules this out.  She is an odd mix of self-consciousness, guilt, and bewilderment, and only resolves to change at the end of the novel.  Even then, this change is more of an acceptance of the way she feels than an actual resolution to make change things.  I am not saying that this isn&#039;t a monumental step for her, but I just thought things would turn out differently, perhaps with a bit more of a wide-scale change in the world.  Having finally sorted out the true story, she finally decides to return to her family and money, but takes with her the woman representative of all of her struggles.  It just seems like everything worked out too happily for her.  Also, I would like to know more about everyone she left behind, specifically Tom, Kinnis, Cel, and Hepple too.  I was wondering if anything would happen between her and Tom, romantic or not, even with her prior sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cyteen response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/216</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did enjoy Cyteen for the story and the characters, particularly in the development of the second Ariane.  However, much of the politics and the verbal sparring went over my head, and I fear this was a significant portion of the novel.  All of the different alliances and enmities between the major political influences in the novel seemed to change so fast, and often to cues that I as a reader did not pick up for several pages after.  The only point that remained constant was Mikhail&#039;s dislike of both the young and old Ariane, and the need for everyone, everywhere, to watch what he or she says for fear of eavesdroppers.  I would have liked more discussion on the sides for and against the system that includes all of the genetic manipulation and the purpose of the &#039;azi.&#039;  I think the Abolitionists were the major party against this, but I may be wrong.  I guess with the severely limited starting population of a planet, some gene manipulation would have to occur to stop proliferation of genetic diseases and weaknesses, but I was surprised that this was not important to many of the characters of the novel.  It appeared that the people had largely just accepted the changes and experiments, as long as the result was human.  I have trouble believing the lack of controversy here.  I guess the secrecy of the grander experiments done by Ariane and the other top researchers may have helped hide this from the public, but I just don&#039;t think the population would accept this system.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, all this small starting population (meaning limited and often unified viewpoints) and the introduction of the &#039;tapes&#039; seems to have created a society in which this is the norm.  The tapes themselves are also controversial, both the tranquilizings needed to view the tapes and the level on which many of them affect the recipient.  While the ability to learn and remember something very quickly and painlessly would be great, I am surprised that there has been no sabotage.  The talk of a tape &#039;worm&#039; interspersed in the novel introduces the idea of some latent danger from the tapes, but with the way they can affect the most basic logic of human consciousness, I would think there would have been some kind of terrorist or conspiracy attempt by those in control.  On a similar note the azi, particularly Caitlin and Florian, have very little say in what they do, and constantly strive to make their master(s) happy. Perhaps this takeover has already occurred through selective breeding and tape inundation, but in such a way and on a scale as to make acceptable to the public as well.  I would think that some kind of artificial intelligence could do many of the jobs just as well as the azi, while not being requiring all of the birthing and raising process.  A society that has faster-than-light travel should be able to manage this.  There is so much of this absolute control over human life, with cloning, breeding, and rejuve, and it strikes me as odd that there has been so little effort to create trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stars in my Pocket response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/197</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects I found in Stars in my Pocket like Grains of Sand was the difference between modern hunting and the &#039;dragon hunting&#039; between pgs 239 and 257.  At first, hunting in the deserts of Velm appears very similar to our human hunting; leaving for a wilderness area, using large &#039;weapons&#039;, receiving advice over territory or placement from an experienced hunter, and eventually finding and firing at the prey, taking something from the prey in the process. The first major difference here is the wanted result.  While real-world hunters seek to kill the prey as fast as possible and in good enough condition for food, skinning or other purposes, hunters on Velm desire to get a glimpse into the mind of the prey for a time and experience all of its senses.  Instead of taking and using for personal, material comfort or pleasure, the Velm hunter shares the preys&#039; experience, and leaves the creature untouched and completely unaware of the hunter&#039;s intrusions.&lt;br /&gt;
	Neither act is necessary; we have an abundance of food in the USA, and the inhabitants of Velm have many alternate sources of entertainment. Yet, both peoples still do it, and on a fairly common basis.  The Earth style of hunting creates a moral conundrum for the people, but has a more distinct purpose and culture behind it.  Hunting is one f the earliest arts that humanity ever developed; we started as nothing more than hunter-gatherers before tribal society emerged.  Later, at any stage in our progress before agriculture could be instated, or any time we expanded outward to new territory, hunting was a primary means of support.  In short, hunting was an integral part of our humanity, though today it may not be as important as in the developmental periods.  Unfortunately, we are missing one important piece of information:  while our form of hunting was at one time essential to survival in the pre-modern USA, we do not know if the Velm mode of hunting was ever crucial to evelm and/or humans on their planet.  The culture behind hunting is hinted at in the last part of the chapter (pg 251-257) when the narrator goes into depth explaining the importance of Singing after the hunt, but it still appears to be more for entertainment or art than survival.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think the major point here is that we still kill even having moved past the kill-for-food stage, which is both harmful and unnecessary.  We claim it is part of a great heritage, an art that should not be lost; yet with how destructive it is to the prey, is it really justified?  Should entertainment or tradition (since there is no longer necessity) come at such a cost?  It is through these differences between our planet and Velm that the key criticism of our ways appears most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lilith&#039;s Brood Respose</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/180</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class Monday and Wednesday I was surprised that no one brought up the biblical aspects of Lilith&#039;s Brood.  I know this a touchy subject, but there are so many references and similar story lines that I thought someone would have brought them up.  The easiest to point out is Lilith, who distinguishes herself in a religious sense both in name and action.  In Hebrew stories she is supposed to have been Adam&#039;s first wife, who would not submit to his supposedly male dominance (including during sex), and was thrown out of Eden for it.  Well, after this she decides to go hang out by the Red Sea, known apparently as being a hang out for all kinds of demons, and has over a hundred children a DAY with them before eventually being punished by God for her &#039;upstart, sinful ways.&#039;  Though this isn&#039;t exactly what Lilith is all about in Brood, there are similarities in the way she doesn&#039;t want to have sex with Paul Titus and is the first to really submit (however involuntarily) to Oankali reproductive practices.  On page 297 she even describes how the Resisters see her as &quot;a second Satan or Satan&#039;s wife.&quot;  I also saw a similarity between the first child she has and Mary giving birth to Jesus in that both were told after the fact, and it was somewhat unexpected at the time.  Both would come to celebrate their children, and both children (Jesus and Akin, and later Jodahs) would have some pretty unique ideas among both humans and Oankali.  Plus, who often left his Oankali parents and purpose to go wandering by himself before returning to spread the spread word of his recently stabilized healing and abilities, and briefly had a relation to a large water-dwelling organism?  Jodahs and Jonas maybe?  Eh, maybe a bit of a stretch.   Besides the names of the people was there any support that the town that Tomas and Jesusa came from had ties to Catholicism?  I remember there being a church in Phoenix but no mention of any church or faith in Jodahs&#039;s mates&#039; village past the usual references to &#039;devil Oankali.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Left Hand of Darkness Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/128</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that was touched on in class recently was the way in which Genly Ai often characterized the ways the Gethenieas acted around him. Particularly interesting to me were the ways that appeared derogatory towards woman, and what this conveys about him and the &#039;Ekumenical&#039; society he comes from.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first that caught my attention appeared on page 48-9, when Genly is describing the Karhiders&#039; absence of war.  He says that, &quot;They lackedâ€¦the capacity to mobilize.  They behaved like animals in that respect; or like woman.  They do not behave like men, or ants.&quot;  In this comparison, he act in a similar manner to Starship Trooper&#039;s Johnny, placing woman on a level seemingly below men when it comes to being able to fight wars.  This is on an even larger scale though; whereas Johnny discredits them as not being infantry or front-line fighters, Genly appears to not seem a woman capable of mobilizing towards war at all.  Similarly, near the end of the novel (pg 299), he describes the first person he meets in the Estre Hearth as so silent that, &quot;no girl could keep so grim a silence as he did.&quot;  This is an oddly conspicuous comment, especially with so little basis in why he would think this way. This little off-hand remark helps lets us infer much about Genlys background.  Later in the novel, Genly confesses to Estreven that he understands very little about woman at all, inferring some trouble he may have had in the past in relationships or meetings with woman in general.  He has his own perception of woman from is own experience, not some grandiose utopian notion of equality or acceptance.  Does this reflect then more on his personal experience, or on the nature of the Ekumen he comes from?&lt;br /&gt;
	In my opinion, the fact that he makes these observations makes the society from which he comes from much more believable as a human future.  At first, at least to me, the Ekumenical system he is from seems overly optimistic.  A large, constantly expanding society with sizeable gaps in technology among several different races, even those with a common genetic background, seems unlikely to be so peaceful, and this makes it unbelievable to me.  Were it not for Genlys infrequent, not-so-PC references, I would have a lot of trouble connecting to the society as a whole.  The references themselves are what make him a human, imperfect and opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/59</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During class this week, there was a lot of discussion about Case, with his &quot;Cowboy&quot; job description and lack of personal choice, and about Molly and her street-samurai status and prostitute beginnings.  After finishing Neuromancer, I find one of the most interesting characters to be Armitage, or Col. Corto, especially so soon after reading Starship Troopers.  In a way, this man&#039;s military background combined with his uncontrolled &quot;life&quot; and death creates an inverse perspective, perhaps even an ironic parody, of the military lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
	When the reader first meets Armitage in the novel, the first detail is of a &quot;broad chest, hairless and muscular&quot;, &quot;blue eyes so pale they made Case think of bleach&quot;, and &quot;an angular gold ring through the [ear] lobe.&quot;(Gibson 27-28)  Immediately, it is made clear that Armitage is a powerful man, equally capable of taking care of himself in a fight as in a business transaction.  The earring is immediately made clear as representation of military Special Forces, which in Case&#039;s world also means the most advanced technology.  This man has countless resources at his disposal, and seems to have more control over his life than any character in the plot so far.  This is not a man who is paid and led along a path; this man is the one who commands, who controls and manipulates those around him into doing his will.  This is only reinforced by the miracle deal he offers Case, and the subsequent revelation of the previously undeclared catch that binds Case to him.   Armitage seems to hold all of the cards, all of the time.	However, later it is revealed that the entire Screaming Fist operation that Armitage participated (and extraordinarily survived) was not to test the effectiveness of the new hacking technology, but to test the effectiveness of the enemy&#039;s EMP weapons on unprepared troops.   They had been expected to die.  While the character Johnny from Starship Troopers might say it was a sacrifice for the nation, here in the much more individualized, discriminatory world of Case&#039;s and Armitage&#039;s, it emerges as a largely arbitrary act commanded by higher level officers and carried out by the unknowing foot soldiers. The only reason Col. Corto (a.k.a. Armitage) survived the slaughter of the Screaming Fist operation and his ensuing coma was through the will of a powerful A.I. by the name of Wintermute.  The Armitage that Case and Molly have known to this point is only an engineered construct from the remnants of Cortos consciousness.  Clearly, Corto has actually had no control over his life from this time onward.  Corto later relives this operation after his constructed consciousness breaks down, reveals that he knows he was betrayed by his Commanders, and is consequently betrayed and destroyed by his engineer Wintermute.&lt;br /&gt;
	From the point Corto is assigned to this mission, he has no further discretion in his own life.   Even Case, who is under the control of his addictions, contractors, and habits, is able to decide where he wants to be or what he wants to do.  Armitage does what he is programmed to do, period, and has even been conditioned to think that these are his own decisions.  He is the ultimate epitome of the cyberpunk culture; while Case and Molly seem to drift numbly through their lives from job too job in a meaningless landscape, Armitage Is actually incapable of feeling any real emotion, and has lost any recognition of the land around him past what Wintermute has programmed him to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Starship Troopers Critical Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/33</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering the points that the class made on Monday concerning the definition of Science Fiction, the way this novel presents the present psychology of chastisement and punishment outlined in the lecture given by Mr. Dubois to the History and Moral Philosophy class was very interesting. (pg 112-120)  Starting with an effective analogy given to Juan about the training of puppies and ending with an explanation as to why a nation based on &quot;pseudo-psychological nonsense&quot; and a &quot;glorifiedâ€¦mythology of rights&quot; cannot endure, he logically explains how such a society, our society, cannot be stable.&lt;br /&gt;
	The beginning analogy of the housebreaking of puppies is very effective in giving a rough example of what should be done to perpetrators of crimes.  After the act, the animal is scolded, his or her nose is rubbed in the &#039;accident,&#039; and then he is swatted.  This is contrasted to the gang action that was apparently very common in the earlier stages of the novel&#039;s history (and in our world today.)  He asserts that by not giving them the proper upbringing as children, more specifically by not including pain in the punishment of crimes, the basic learning instincts of humanity was not utilized, and thus no lesson was learned.  So, on subsequent crimes, when the maximum crime was inflicted, it would be similar to never swatting a puppy, then shooting it after it&#039;s still are not housebroken as a full grown dog.&lt;br /&gt;
	A girl I the class comments on this, saying how she doesn&#039;t mind being swatted once in a while when compared to not being able to be outside at night.  This added point of view, the opposite of the modern idea, is a clever device.  Her ending comment, &quot;Why--that&#039;s horrible!&quot;, is a very human approach towards a seemingly inhumane way of thinking.  That is, that of increased, violent punishment as opposed to psychological therapy and understanding.  The idea is that the wrong way of thinking, our modern way, is &quot;half fuzzy-headed wishful thinking, half rationalized charlatanry.&quot;  Dubois asserts that, &quot;Man has no moral instinct.&quot;  This is an extremely nihilistic statement, proposing that not only is man no more than a highly trained animal, but also has no overarching moral sense, like that bestowed by divinity.  After this he goes on to propose that there is no morality, just an elaboration of the instinct to survive.  This is what brings him to the crux of his argument, which are the imperatives of survival that surpass that of the individual, and the loss of this in the old society.&lt;br /&gt;
	This includes the survival of family, children, and higher.  In the novel culture especially, the importance of the nation, planet, and even species are placed in higher regard.  By examining the problem faced by the individual in why one feels the need to place one&#039;s wellbeing on the line, one can tell how far up the moral ladder one can go.  Whether one is capable of giving one&#039;s life for a cause as lofty and obscure as &#039;the good of mankind.&#039;  The street gang members only reached the level of simple gang obedience; the never were taught or learned to look any higher.  Thus, any attempt to appeal to their morality or better natures is completely useless since there is nothing to appeal to.  They were given every opportunity and every benefit of the doubt, when in truth, says Mr. Dubois, they should have been punished immediately.  That was the major difference; instead of punishment, duty, and morality, they were taught they had rights.  Each juvenile that was pampered, that was not taught right from wrong and had it proven by instinct, was the result of the moral failings of an adult above him or her.  They championed rights they lost all sense of duty, to any level of society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Test, and first response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/20</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whew, meant to do this earlier.  Well in any case, I don&#039;t read a whole lot of science fiction, but I thought ST was very interesting.  I agree that woman were placed on pedestals as something to fight for, but I did not get the feeling that they were any less important or empowered than the men were.  With all of the power, and yes danger included in the position of being a ship&#039;s captain, the woman captain have their fair share of the cake.  I think however that the purpose behind having the woman aboard did go beyond their abilities as pilots.  I remember a passage where Juan spoke of how the last voice an MI heard before the drop was the female captain starting the drop sequence.  This is somewhat akin to a mother&#039;s voice to her protected child, comforting them before sending them into a hostile world, and would be deeply comforting on some very basic, instinctual levels.  Perhaps then the woman serve not only as objects to admire, but also as &#039;mother&#039; figures on board, whether or not the MI&#039;s realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
