 <title>Oryx and Crake: Once again, Science is Evil</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/343</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a common trope for fiction writers to hate science and technology. The idea that knowledge is a recipe for destruction is deeply rooted in the past, dating back to at least Prometheus&#039; punishment for stealing fire from Mount Olympus. But the more blunt examples are those in the mad scientist category; the Frankensteins, the Jekkyl and Hydes, the Dr. Moreaus, the Lex Luthors, etc. By taking their pursuits of science to unethical extremes, these characters not only wreak havoc, but shame the entire concept of science. Never mind that technology is what has allowed human beings to survive this long, can dramatically improve the length and quality of life, and ( for the &quot; first world &quot;, at least ) has done so repeatedly; all it takes is one guy inventing one monster, and the whole fictional world slides into a Luddite bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake is no different, with its dystopian setting founded on consumer technology run amok. Biotechnology has led to monstrous creations that probably would have led to antibiotic-impervious diseases, information technology and new media have resulted in instant and accepted access to the barbaric, and the resources of the world are dwindling rapidly. There is no suggestion that humanity is trying to improve itself, but merely sleepwalking towards oblivion. Meanwhile, the amoral genius Crake determines that the only way to save society is to replace it with a group of docile, intelligently designed primates with no concept of art or progress. Everyone else is apparently a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we don&#039;t get the Star Trek type view of technology as a faultless elixir for all of humanity&#039;s ills, it would be nice to see a more balanced viewpoint. Atwood is incredibly effective at pointing out the ways technology can be used for destructive purposes, but not so much at showing constructive uses for science. There is no entertainment of the idea that Crake&#039;s science could have saved humanity, merely that the damage that his predecessors did to themselves was irreparable. Apocalypse is a forgone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downfall of society in Oryx and Crake is ultimately not the fault of the technologies, but the people and cultures that abused them-- people like Crake, who hides his sociopathy behind his claims of empirical evidence. When a religion is criticized for the acts of a few fundamentalists, others are quick to point out that the majority of believers are decent, law-abiding citizens. Perhaps a large section of fiction writers need to apply the same logic to science and scientists?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer vs. Pattern Recognition: Evolution towards Ambiguity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/315</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search revealed to me that Pattern Recognition, the eighth novel by William Gibson, was the first to be on the New York Times Bestsellers list, and the first to be set in a contemporary world instead of a fantastical one. The increased overall popularity of the more recent William Gibson novels ( as opposed to Neuromancer, whose popularity was more of a word-of-mouth cult hit ) may be due to this; however, speaking personally, I found the contemporary world of Pattern Recognition less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing about Gibson&#039;s work is that it is so incredibly dense and detailed, convoluted with tech-slang and computer jargon everywhere. &quot; Cognitive estrangement &quot;, as mentioned in the first week; making a fictional world so strange that it forces us to re-examine the way we think about reality. Neuromancer&#039;s early-cyberspace world does this with its advanced technologies and virtual worlds. Pattern Recognition tries to do the same. Unfortunately, Pattern Recognition takes it too far, by creating a world ( ironically, even more &quot; grounded &quot; in our reality ) that&#039;s so alien that the message is lost in its own convolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, may well be the point. Gibson may be trying to show us that the future ( which we are living in now ) is even more alien and disconnected than we ever could have imagined. But the narrative didn&#039;t communicate this to me as well. Neuromancer may have been talking about a profoundly artificial world, but it did so through a more traditional narrative-- a designated ( if not actually ) heroic protagonist on an action-packed adventure, who ends up changing the world at large. The characters may have been thinner and more cliche, but they were identifiable-- familiar &quot; cliches &quot; to ground very unfamiliar ideas. The cast of Pattern Recognition are more complex, but also much harder to define, and thus I think the power of the statements in the book are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit: Case is an anti-heroic super-hacker, a &quot; console cowboy &quot; who could be a typical video game hero. Cayce is a design-sensitive marketing consultant who explores metropolitan board meetings, club scenes, and hotel arrangements in an attempt to find context and understanding in her multimedia world. More complex, but almost paralyzingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Link of Interest: Snow Crash on TVTropes.org</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/281</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in class, this should be of interest to any fans of Snow Crash, or fiction in general...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&quot; title=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&quot;&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shown Their Work entry seems especially relevant, as now I know more about Sumerian mythology than I ever cared to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Swordplay in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/260</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading Snow Crash, the most consistently jarring ( as in, taking me out of the story ) aspect was Hiro&#039;s swordplay. Though he&#039;s the greatest hacker in the world ( both real world and Metaverse ), he&#039;s equally proud of being the greatest swordsman. He carries his katanas everywhere, and uses them extensively-- not just in the Metaverse, but the real world. A modern-day samurai, with the emphasis on &quot; modern-day &quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s obviously a lot of entertainment inherent to the sword fights, and a lot of that is due to romanticizing the sword. Though rendered obsolete by the invention of guns, swords are arguably more attractive, take more skill to use, are more visceral in the way they dispatch foes. Anyone can point a gun and shoot ( hitting the target being more difficult ), but swordsmanship is a difficult skill, even an art. No wonder they remain popular in fiction, despite being much rarer in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties perfectly into Hiro&#039;s identity; one, in terms of a skill that he would want to practice ( he defines himself by mastering complex tasks, either hacking or swordplay ), two, in terms of ethnic identity ( the Japanese/Nipponese aspects of his background are symbolized in the way he carries his swords with him everywhere ), and three, just as an expression of maschismo. It&#039;s all well and good, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that this is not Fuedal Japan, this is a Cyberpunk future where firearms are everywhere.  I can get him using his swords in the virtual world, but in reality? Where he&#039;s surrounded by enemies with guns? Where sticking around to cut people up would logically make him a huge target and resultantly get him filled with lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&#039;s a lot of this &quot; Rule of Cool &quot; stuff in Snow Crash, things like rocketboards and supersonic cyborg attack dogs and what not, but this is particularly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Structure/POV/tense of Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/223</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing that I noticed about Nicola Griffith&#039;s Slow River was the variance in storytelling styles. Not only are there three different storylines ( Lore&#039;s life with Spanner, her work at the purification plant, her childhood flashbacks ), but they are told in three different ways ( third person past-tense, first person past-tense, third-person present-tense ).  It was incredibly jarring for me at first, as it went against everything grammar school had taught me about sticking to one style of narration and one time frame. It&#039;s still a bit odd, but I&#039;ve been able to work through what Griffith was trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-person past-tense from Lore&#039;s personal life is narration designed to make Lore seem alienated and out-of-place, even from herself; we do not get her POV directly, because she is not the center of this universe. She comes in destitute, is taken in by Spanner, and put into a life far different than the privilege she is used to. Her relationship with the cynical, morally ambiguous Spanner is of a very tenuous nature, and she is very ambivalent to the illicit activities she gets involved in. Even though Lore and Spanner are very intimate physically, the narration style seems to indicate an obvious disconnect between action and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-person present-tense from the flashbacks seems to indicate the same sort of alienation, but the shift in tense indicates the importance of her memory; for Lore, her formative years and trauma are not just recordings from the past, but something so important and visceral that it permeates the rest of her life. Like they say, some memories are so vivid that they seem like they just happened yesterday; with Lore&#039;s tragic backstory, this would be very appropriate. The third-person POV continues to keep it alienated from her, though also from us; I can see how getting a blow-by-blow recount from Lore as things like the kidnapping are happening to her would be too painful to read, and for that matter, even harder for Griffith to write without slipping into melodrama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-person accounts from Lore&#039;s job as Sal Bird are a bit harder for me to get my head around. I can see how the fact that Lore develops her own agency in the field of biological science helps put the spotlight back on her, as she goes from being a spectator to an active player. However, it still seems like Lore has to accept that there is only so little that she can do in her position; she&#039;s still the same person as she is at home with Spanner, even if she is more in her element. It almost seems unnecessary, because while we hear about Lore&#039;s feelings in both of the present-continuity storylines, only the POV makes a difference. And there, it&#039;s just the semantics of wordplay.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Post-Humanism, Part One: Experiences in the Class Thus Far</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/189</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me about several of the novels we&#039;ve read thus far is that their speculation is based on human biology; specifically, the attempt to alter and control it. In the past I came across a word for this; post-humanism, a nebulous and ill-defined term, but one ultimately centered around the concept of building better humans. There have been aspects of this in most of the books we&#039;ve read, such as...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Starship Troopers: The soldiers rely even more on science than any in our history. The M-I are not so much foot soldiers as pilots for their suits, the equivalent of a second skin that enhances their durability and movement. The suits are much more personal than any conventional military vehicle, to the point where they move based on feedback from the pilot&#039;s body motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Neuromancer: Practically everyone is altered in some way; Case is described as a wasted human body whose utility is based primarily on his digital self. Molly takes a physical role, but she&#039;s full of various machines, such as her claws and her eyes. And there are characters like Wintermute and Neuromancer who act sentient, but that are hard to classify as human because they lack any biological components. Artificial intelligence, but hardly robotic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and The Left Hand of Darkness: Much harder to classify as post-human, because they&#039;re more about the examination of sexual relationships than scientific ones; not mutually exclusive, but generally these books are more about exploring biology as it is than what it could be. Still, the characters are altered in various ways; the Handmaid&#039;s Tale shows an attempt to control reproduction ( more socially than scientifically ), and The Left Hand of Darkness has the hemaphrodite characters use drugs to accelerate/stunt their &quot; kemmer &quot; period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Lilith&#039;s Brood: Probably the most post-human focused of all the books we&#039;ve read, because it not only has humans being altered by alien technology, but the results of that alteration across the generations. The Oankali, with their biological machines, attach new genes that change the human body. Not just in terms of healing the sick, but strengthening the basic human structure; Lilith is the best example, as she gains enhanced strength, regenerative powers, the ability to interface with the walls of the ship, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand: I&#039;m still working through this book as of this post, but the fact that &quot; rats &quot; ( humans altered to have enhanced capabilites and removed free will ) play so heavily into it suggests that similar ideas will come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these patterns is quite interesting; I&#039;ll have more comments on the post-human connections later...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Cohesison in Lilith&#039;s Brood: Dawn</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/154</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really a criticism of Butler&#039;s work, but an observation I&#039;ve been mulling over for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I&#039;ve finished Dawn and am working through Adulthood Rites. Like most of you, I&#039;m doing so through the format of the Lilith&#039;s Brood omnibus edition that collects all three novels. But reading this all consecutively offers a different experience than what one would get by reading the novels individually; for instance, reading Dawn on its own and getting to Adulthood Rites later. And I&#039;m very curious what impression one would get from reading the three novels as individual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audience raised on pop culture and genre fiction generally expects narrative cohesion; that everything get resolved, or at least have a clean break from one unit in the series to the next. Though the universe&#039;s story is not completely settled, the individual plot threads of the novel are usually tied up to the point where the conclusion at least feels satisfying. Consider recent examples like the TV show House ( though House is still messed up, the medical mystery of the episode is solved, and the patient in question goes off into the sunset ), the Harry Potter novels ( each book chronicles one school year, a clear start and end to that book&#039;s adventure ), and distinct story arcs in comic books that are later collected in complete trade paperbacks ( though the overarching story of a series like Preacher or Y the Last Man continues, each collection offers a complete narrative ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn, however, followed an opposite trend. The ending of Dawn does offer a significant change-- Nikanji impregnating Lilith with the dead Joseph&#039;s DNA-- but it&#039;s really just a continuation of the larger problem that Lilith faces. Since her awakening, the Oankali have been meddling in her affairs to a ridiculous extent, using their seeming omniscence to determine what&#039;s best for her, only answering her questions when they want to, and altogether robbing her of the ability to choose her own fate. Lilith is obviously ambivalent to this, as any sane person would be, but the aliens don&#039;t relent-- they modify her gene structure, they determine what time and place she&#039;ll be,  they throw upon her the responsibility of being the leader to the Awakened humans, etc. And the final scene doesn&#039;t resolve anything, it just confirms the fact that Lilith is the prisoner of these benevolently tyrannical aliens. Just because they sensed that she was alone and wanted a child doesn&#039;t give them the right to put one inside her without asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t a problem when the work is read in one seamless volume, but if I were to read Dawn independently, I&#039;d probably be frustrated; not so much by the cliffhanger ending, but the fact that Lilith has made no progress whatsoever, and is still the Oankali&#039;s puppet. Given what they&#039;ve done to her, almost any good will she may have towards the aliens strikes me as the onset of Stockholm&#039;s Syndrome...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The saving grace of the Starship Troopers movie</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/32</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that I thought was very clever in the Starship Troopers film was the use of mock-newsreels to set the stage. Not only are they an interesting throwback to older wars, but they&#039;re so over-the-top in their obvious propaganda that they really drive the point home of just how entrenched this society is in its culture of &quot; citizenship &quot;. Scenes like the enlistment ads with the soldiers showing their weapons to little children, graphic depictions of the bugs&#039; carnage ( albeit with certain parts covered with Censored logos ), and kids joining the war effort by stepping on earth insects may seem overly exaggerated, until one realizes that even this kind of propaganda can be profoundly effective in the right climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the scenes of the kids stomping on Earth bugs. That was profoundly disturbing to me when I considered that the bugs those kids were killing ( under their parents&#039; explicit approval ) were harmless. Harmless, but still a scapegoat, an allegorical stand-in for real life minorities that happen to be associated with their country&#039;s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s scenes like this that help convince me that the Starship Troopers film was indeed a clever parody of the novel, though all the obligatory Hollywood garbage ( giant firebreathing CGI monsters, romantic subplots, dying soldiers lasting just long enough to give a melodramatic passage, etc. ) could easily convince me to be more cynical about it. Still, I&#039;d like to think that the director really did have a purpose that got lost through all the executive meddling...&lt;/p&gt;
