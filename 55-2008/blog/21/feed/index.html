 <title>Time Trauma Fiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/345</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There was much talk--and there might easily have been more--about Pattern Recognition&#039;s being legible as a 9/11 novel. The event is manifestly significant for the novel plot-wise, but also to the extent that it informs the book&#039;s disrupted sense of history. It&#039;s interesting, then, that Oryx and Crake was conceived under similar circumstances--might it then be possible to read this book as a response to 9/11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in our first class on Pattern Recognition, the composition of Gibson&#039;s book was interrupted by the attacks on the World Trade Center towers. In &quot;My Life in Science Fiction,&quot; Atwood gives a similar account. What&#039;s of note, then, is how differently the writers respond, how differently they adapt their respective works in progress to reflect what feels to them a different world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think I need to say much about how significant Gibson&#039;s work clearly thinks 9/11 is. Although it&#039;s only, like, a thirtieth of the book, it pervades the rest in really palpable ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Atwood responds by taking a culturally inward turn. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, the closest we get to the quasi-apocalyptic act that catalyzed the sociopolitical lockdown that&#039;s the novel&#039;s main interest is a vague reference to Islamic terrorists. As Atwood notes in her essay, though, &quot;It&#039;s deeply unsettling when you&#039;re writing about a fictional catastrophe and a real one happens.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, this novel works pretty similarly to the earlier one. We&#039;re immediately plunged into a nightmare scenario. There&#039;s cognitive estrangement to the extent that the reader is madly palpating the conventions and limits both official and personal in this new and utterly bizarre world. As in THT, we&#039;ve the general sense that something really, truly awful happened that precipitated the mess we&#039;re witnessing; as in THT, we&#039;re given no clues as to what that might be. At least to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this formal structure, one would assume that the nature of the event itself--whatever it was that gave rise to the new order as it exists in the novel--would be rather more malleable. In which case--and given Atwoods concerns as voiced in her earlier novel--isn&#039;t it all the stranger that Atwoods imaginary apocalypse in Oryx and Crake comes from within, rather than from without?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the result is much the same. For Gibson, 9/11 causes a rupture in history. When he represents the event in his novel, he switches tenses. London functions as a displaced metropolis--the novel is really about New York. The book does everything it can to disconnect us from time and space, as mimetic of mass trauma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake does basically the same things. On the first page, time is the primary question. A question of basic orientation, of order--&quot;Out of habit he looks at his watch&quot;; &quot;It causes a jolt of terror to run through him, this absence of official time&quot;; &quot;Nobody nowhere knows what time it is.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether she chooses to represent the events themselves or no, I&#039;d suggest that Atwood observes a mass dislocation of space and time as a consequence of 9/11 as Gibson does.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unrepresentable</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/331</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that struck me while reading Pattern Recognition is that it must be impossible to convincingly describe rapturous aesthetic experience. Or to represent an aesthetic work within an aesthetic work. I&#039;m thinking of the &quot;footage&quot; in the novel and how basically unappealing it sounded to me whenever described. Or, rather, it wasn&#039;t so much that I found it unappealing, but that I had serious difficulty imagine anyone having such a strong aesthetic reaction to it as to, you know, devote hours every day to scouring the web for more footage, or obsess endlessly--see &quot;Zaprudered&quot;--over the already discovered chunks. It just didn&#039;t sound that cool to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the first description: &quot;Light and shadow. Lovers&#039; cheekbones in the prelude to embrace.&quot; Gibson often writes fragments like these; usually they&#039;re meant to convey a sense of kinesis--like, if somebody&#039;s running down the street observing things, those things will then get referred to in sentence fragments. Here, I guess the fragments are meant to convey the movement or progress of the film itself. Also: they&#039;re not very pretty sentences. Rather than try to represent the aesthetic quality of the film via any sort of high lyricism, Gibson&#039;s made the more conservative move: just describe what Cayce sees on the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what does she see? Two people hugging against a black background. The description makes it sound as if the film were in black and white, although that&#039;s never explicitly stated--all the &quot;light&quot; v. &quot;dark&quot; stuff sounds like a BW chiaroscuro. Something like German expressionism, I guess; a Murnau film of two people hugging. And then the kiss, and the flash and white-out. And this sends Cayce into rapture? After she&#039;s seen it twice, she&#039;s so exhausted that she has to go to bed--granted, she was tired before watching the film, but then she gets all hopped up on coffee in order to watch it. I just don&#039;t buy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think I&#039;m simply being an uncharitable reader, though. As I said, I think Gibson&#039;s problem is bigger than just his having written some uninspired description. I think something similar happens in David Foster Wallace&#039;s book Infinite Jest, actually. For those of you who haven&#039;t read it, one of the several plots has to do with this mysterious movie made by an artsy filmmaker that&#039;s so unbelievably captivating that anyone who watches it never wants to stop and so essentially goes into a coma--people die in front of their screens because they can&#039;t stop watching the movie. Obviously, it&#039;s a joke--Infinite Jest is part science fiction in that it&#039;s extrapolative; the whole bit with the movie is taking idea of &quot;mindless&quot; entertainment and positing a world in which entertainment really had the ability to make people mindless. So the world of Infinite Jest is actually less governed by the rules of the empirical world than that of Pattern Recognition; it&#039;s easier to believe that Infinite Jest the movie has the kind of power over people that Wallace says it does simply because his world isn&#039;t the same as ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, though, whenever IJ gets around to describing scenes from the movie--which happens, I think, maybe in an endnote somewhere around page six-hundred--it really just doesn&#039;t sound that cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace does the same dancing around the actual description of the film that Gibson does in this book. Before we have any idea what Infinite Jest the film looks like, we know that people become fatally addicted to it; before we have any clue at all as to what the &quot;footage&quot; is of, we know that there&#039;s a significant underground of hardcore devotees. In both cases, then, the expectation of the film&#039;s aesthetic content is pretty astronomically high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in both cases--it seems to me--the representation of a representation is doomed to fail. Plato already knew that, though.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Atlantis - A Sun Ra Appreciation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/285</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was watching &quot;The Last Angel of History&quot; this evening, and I spent the first fifteen minutes wondering &quot;When are they gonna talk about Sun Ra? Why aren&#039;t they talking about Sun Ra? Who&#039;s George Clinton without Sun Ra?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, the film brought him up. Still, though, as far as the space motif in black musics goes, the movie definitely thinks that George Clinton is the ne plus ultra. At one point, Derrick May refers to Sun Ra as &quot;George Clinton&#039;s mentor.&quot; But then the topic gets dropped, and the film again assumes George Clinton to be the pinnacle of the phenomenon of SF in black musics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is simply to bring up the great work of Sun Ra once again. Space is the Place is probably the most famous album, if only because of the film tie-in (even if you haven&#039;t heard the album you may have seen the blaxploitation movie of same name). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me, Atlantis is actually his best album, and it&#039;s also the one that&#039;s most easily legible as the blend of blues, jazz, funk, and electronic music that the movie hints at at the beginning--the whole &quot;black technology&quot; bit with the Robert Johnson myth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the song &quot;Lemuria,&quot; for instance. It starts off with a single, off-tune keyboard note, followed by scattered-sounding snare tapping; not quite a count-in rhythm, even, but a sort of primordial presence, wherein you could imagine the seeds of such a rhythm developing. But before that happens, a stuttering electric funk guitar. The guitar proceeds on its own, tentatively, for a few seconds. You know how your computer stutters a little right when you bring it out of hibernation? This guitar sounds as if played by a robot just awakened from such a hibernation. You can&#039;t even really tell whether it&#039;s funk; it might be that the robot is trying to emulate Robert Johnson after all. Then there&#039;s a dot-dot-dash of a keyboard staccato popping up in between guitar notes. Then the snare comes back; then a wincing, farting saxophone appears. And suddenly there&#039;s a lurching, lumbering blues robot trying it&#039;s damnedest to dance a funk dance. And it sort of works, but the coolest part is how it doesn&#039;t quite all hang together, like a Thelonious Monk rhythm but with the the whole body, all the limbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s what I imagine a fully activated black music technology--such as the film posits--sounding like. If you don&#039;t know it, check it out. And remember that he was doing this at least ten years before Mothership Connection (and much longer, in fact; Atlantis was, of course, a mid-to-late album, coming as it did in 1967).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Black-and-White Persons</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/279</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class we talked about a couple different ways that Snow Crash analogizes issues of race: &quot;thrashers&quot; constitute an ethnic identity; hackers, too, have unique social identities as well as somewhat unique physiologies. In this response, I guess I just want to add another example, but it&#039;s one that I find particularly interesting: the figure of the &quot;black-and-white person&quot; within the Metaverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the &quot;black-and-white person&quot; is not immediately visible as at least analogously related to a racial identity, I guess I&#039;ll suggest a couple ways in which the book presents him/her/it in that way. First is the issue of context. Snow Crash has an almost Faulknerian interest in multiraciality; not since Joe Christmas has a fictional character&#039;s polyglot identity caused so much trouble--e.g., when YT is fleeing from the &quot;jeeks&quot; at The Clink, she considers briefly pulling into a New South Africa franchulate, but then decides against it: &quot;Scratch that; Hiro is black, or at least part black. Can&#039;t take him into New South Africa&quot; (83). I guess the point that I would make is that racial identities are important to the book--it&#039;s important that YT is white (not just as &quot;whitey,&quot; but also as a fifteen-year-old white female who, we&#039;re told repeatedly, is in constant danger of being raped because of that fact; who hangs limp and Fay Wray-ish in Raven&#039;s arms as he carries her onto the Raft); it&#039;s important that Raven&#039;s American Indian, and, what&#039;s more, part of this significance is that Hiro can&#039;t figure out what racial identity to give Raven--it&#039;s the fate of the Aleut in this book to be the ignored or misrecognized identity. Someone who--like Hiro--represents &quot;and&quot; rather than &quot;either/or&quot; is bound to throw a wrench in the book&#039;s classification system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, lo and behold, that is pretty much how things turn out for the &quot;black-and-white person&quot; in the Metaverse. Here I guess I should say that, obviously, anyone can be a black-and-white person; the black-and-white person is treated as an identity that inheres only in the Metaverse; at various times, many different characters of many different real-world racial identities become black-and-white people. Someone may appear in the Metaverse as a black-and-white person one day, and then as someone altogether different the next. So there are a lot of ways in which being black-and-white in the Metaverse isn&#039;t like being black or white in the real world. But there is a sense in which the black-and-white identity takes over for real world racial identities; you can&#039;t be both black and black-and-white; therefore, having a black-and-white identity in the Metaverse works as a substitute for the social work that&#039;s done when one has a white identity in the real world. Right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some examples. The &quot;black-and-white person&quot; in the Metaverse is a universally spat-upon identity. This is unique in the universe of Snow Crash. New South Africans hate blacks, Asians, and Jews. Italians don&#039;t really seem to like Asians all that much. American Indians--if Raven is a representative sample, which he surely isn&#039;t--hate pretty much everyone. But point being: there really doesn&#039;t seem to be a group that&#039;s loathed by every other group. Except the black-and-white person in the context of the Metaverse. &quot; &#039;Da5id,&#039; Hiro says, &#039;I can&#039;t believe you took a hypercard from a black-and-white person&#039;&quot; (72); &quot;Going into The Black Sun would not be practical--it would look and sound terrible, and the other patrons would look at him as if he were some kind of black-and-white person&quot; (106); &quot;She knows that the people in the Street are giving her dirty looks because she&#039;s just coming in from a shitty public terminal. She&#039;s a trashy black-and-white person&quot; (220). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are clearly historical analogies for all these examples, all of which have to do with racial hatred. In some of the examples of how black-and-white persons are disliked, one could imagine substituting either &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot;--like, hypothetically, someone could possibly say, &quot;She&#039;s a trashy white person.&quot; But basically these examples refer to racial hatred directed at black people in American history. Like, the fact that Hiro&#039;s not welcome in the bar because he&#039;s a black-and-white person sounds like the sort of segregation and intolerance that led to sit-ins in the 1950s. Anyway, that&#039;s sort of beside the point, and it&#039;s awkward to point these things out because, in a way, the book is sort of playfully flippant about the topic--the phrase &quot;black-and-white person&quot; itself is sort of a joke, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we go back to the last example I gave, we&#039;re directed to most interesting account of what race looks like in the universe of Snow Crash. Again, I&#039;m not suggesting that the black-and-white person is a racial identity, but rather that it functions similarly, just as thrashers and hackers function as identities that are in certain ways analogous to race. But in the last example, YT reminds us that the reason black-and-white persons are disliked is because, other folks in the Metaverse assume, they&#039;re too poor to afford their own computer or are otherwise technologically disadvantaged--&quot;she&#039;s just coming in from a shitty public terminal.&quot; This account literalizes the socio-economic assumptions that--Snow Crash avers--subtend racial judgments. There&#039;s the clichÃ© (it is a clichÃ©, but one that&#039;s almost certainly sometimes accurate) that when white cops see a black man driving a nice car, they assume it&#039;s stolen; meaning they assume that black people in general can&#039;t afford nice cars. In the Metaverse, the very fact that one appears as a black-and-white person means that one has somehow been reduced to the humiliating situation of having to use a &quot;shitty public terminal.&quot; Again, this is imperfect; YT isn&#039;t really poor--although, it is true that, in a technocratic society, she wouldn&#039;t rank very high; she&#039;s only OK at guiding her avatar in the Metaverse and is constantly making fun of Hiro for the amount of time he spends logged on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess what&#039;s interesting to me is that Snow Crash seems to make the case that total privatization will mete out racial hatreds when profitable and stamp them out when not, such that they eventually become a non-issue--or an issue, as I suggested above, that no one group especially suffers from (although Raven might take issue with this statement). But even in such a universe, the less-privatized VR space of the Metaverse reproduces absolute hatreds, where there is one group that is just so generally loathed as to not want to show his/her black-and-white self in public.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anal Play</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/255</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Point the first: eXistenZ equates its VR game with sodomy. Ted says he doesn&#039;t like to be penetrated; Allegra sexily lubes up his &quot;tight&quot; bioport before his &quot;first time&quot;; of course, when we get a look at the bioport, it looks like an asshole; then there&#039;s the really great bioport sex scene, in which Ted tongues Allegra&#039;s bioport, she responds with surprise, then arousal, then Ted, you know, fucks her in the bioport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this might be a somewhat less pressing question for the film and for the nature of VR games in general (it&#039;s in this context that we&#039;re putting eXistenZ in apposition to Snow Crash) since it&#039;s Cronenberg at the helm. Anyone who&#039;s seen Videodrome will remember the VCR-vagina that spontaneously appears in the middle of James Woods&#039;s chest, and how James Woods masturbates his VCR-vagina with a gun and then loses the gun in said orifice. It&#039;s weird and creepy and typically Cronenbergian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the stakes are somewhat different in eXistenZ. In this case, the anal nature of the bioport suffuses Ted and Allegra&#039;s discourse. For the first twenty minutes or so, any off-hand remark about Ted&#039;s gaming inexperience is also a prurient sexual remark, in which Ted is figured as the submissive (&quot;passive&quot; would typically be better, I guess, but seems less appropriate for describing the dynamics of these scenes) partner in anal sex--e.g., &quot;You&#039;ll see how natural it feels.&quot; Under other circumstances, such lines wouldn&#039;t have the same bizarre sexual charge that they do here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has clear anxieties about the use of VR; in the final scene, Ted and Allegra accuse the game Evgeny of bastardizing reality. In a way, it makes sense that the sexual appeal of VR would be the sexual appeal of sodomy.  In Christian history, the typical reason for banning sodomy--which can include anal and oral sex, obviously--has to do not with how you do it, but why; sodomy opposes reproductive sex, which is regarded as the only good form of sex. In class, we talked a little about the seeming absurdity of wanting to accumulate Linden dollars--what&#039;s the point? is the standard take. Put value-intensively, one might say, why not do something *actually* productive? Instead, we could think of VR commerce as a sodomitical commerce. Whatever threat inheres in VR is the threat of the nonproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Aliens Like Shakespeare, Too</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/170</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As a humanist leech, I sometimes feel left out of certain SF authors&#039; visions of the future. In Starship Troopers, disciplines like philosophy are entirely ceded to the sciences--viz. the constant references to &quot;mathematically verifiable moral truths.&quot; And this is to say nothing of the uses of mimetic representation--a curious absence, given that such visions of the future are made via a sort of mimetic representation. We talked in class about whether there was art on Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness. In Lilith&#039;s Brood, Butler explicitly states that there isn&#039;t art among the Resisters. This comes up when it gets revealed that, prior to the war, Gabe used to be an actor by profession. What&#039;s particularly interesting, though, is the way aesthetic experience gets linked with the tactile communication that takes place between constructs and Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Akin clearly has no idea what it means to be an actor. He describes the phenomenon of performance art in descriptive terms that turn out to be sort of alarming: &quot;Gabe had been an actor. People gave him money and goods so that he would pretend to be someone else&quot; (408). Aside from basic cultural miscommunication, Akin&#039;s objections to Gabe&#039;s acting look, at first, pretty Platonic. &quot;&#039;Didn&#039;t your mother ever tell you any stories?&#039; [Gabe] asked Akin. &#039;Yes,&#039; Akin said. &#039;But they were true&#039;&quot; (408). Here, Akin&#039;s idea is that fiction--or, probably, any other form of mimetic representation--is not a useful endeavor because its empirical falseness renders it a less good way to communicate between persons information about human-/Oankali-nature, the given world, etc. Plato, of course, makes this objection in Book X of the Republic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dovetails unsettlingly with the state of utter destruction that has been wrought on Earth by this time in the novel. &quot;&#039;She never told you about the three bears?&#039; &#039;What&#039;s a bear?&#039;&quot; (408). This perspective shift renders impotent Akin&#039;s attack on acting as well as Gabe&#039;s defense of same. At a certain point, the biological mandate to survive trumps any sort of demands that aesthetic objects impose on us. Art pales in the face of death--or, in this case, extinction. I take this to be a really useful observation that perhaps SF authors, in general, are in a better position to make than other fiction writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabe&#039;s performance of Lear for Akin is described simply as a transformation: &quot;Gabe became an old man&quot; (408). Despite his initial reservations, Akin has a powerful experience of empathic substitution: &quot;Somehowâ€¦he felt what Gabe seemed to want him to feel. Surprise, anger, betrayal, utter bewilderment, despair, madnessâ€¦.&quot; (408). A wide range of the human experience suddenly becomes available to Akin, and he experiences it immanently. It&#039;s an incredible fact about art that it can make subjective experience communicable between persons; that it should also do this between species says something about the real (potential) power of representation in the universe of Lilith&#039;s Brood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, when Akin attempts to describe to Gabe his experience as an audience, he describes it as being similar to a form of communication unique to the Oankali: &quot;It&#039;s like what we do--constructs and Oankali. It&#039;s like when we touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (409). There might not be a better way to paraphrase the purpose of art than to say it&#039;s &quot;talking with feelings and pressures.&quot; The humanist tradition, it turns out, survives, albeit in a semi-recognizable form. But that seems to be a theme in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness may be about gender, and it may be about weather, but it&#039;s also very clearly about the schism between words and real world referents. The vocabulary that LeGuin uses to describe this poststructuralist phenomenon is &quot;veneer.&quot; This comes up first during the description of Argaven&#039;s jingoistic speeches, in which he advocates for war without, we are told repeatedly and in a way that starts to grate by the end of the book, being able to say the word &quot;war.&quot; Ai points out that it&#039;s interesting, then, for Argaven to be so concerned with notions of capital-T &quot;Truth,&quot; given the fact that his oratory consists in large part of deception: &quot;He talked a great deal about Truth also, for he was, he said, &#039;cutting down beneath the veneer of civilization&#039;&quot; (102).&lt;br /&gt;
	This pretty much sets Ai off. He really does not, evidently, appreciate hearing Argaven talk about truth or, we find out, about &quot;veneer&quot;: &quot;It is a durable, ubiquitous, specious metaphor, that one about veneer (or paint, or pliofilm, or whatever) hiding the nobler reality beneath. It can contain a dozen fallacies at once&quot; (102). Genly Ai&#039;s complaint, then, is that the &quot;veneer&quot; argument--the argument about an obfuscating something-or-other that&#039;s always blocking from view the true nature of things--is itself a bit of empty rhetoric, something that nobody if pressed is really sure what to make of. Here, Ai proves himself wrong even as he delivers a deft criticism. There is, clearly, an obfuscating something-or-other, a &quot;veneer,&quot; but it has to do with language; with metaphor, perhaps; with one&#039;s ability to say what one means; not with, as Argaven too-broadly claims, &quot;civilization.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The book gives two very elaborate and drawn-out examples of how language comes to obscure meaning. The first of these is the concept of &quot;shifgrethor.&quot; LeGuin throws out a lot of made up words to stand in for objects and ideas in the community of TLHoD, but this is the only one that strikes me as sort of ingenious. The only definition of &quot;shifgrethor&quot; we are ever given doesn&#039;t really completely square with how the word gets used in conversation between characters--but this is perhaps because the term is only obliquely defined, is defined as, in a sense, indefinable--&quot;prestige, face, place, the pride-relationship, the untranslatable and all-important principle of social authority&quot; (14). Great. So we have a narrator who&#039;s in the unique position to tell us that there&#039;s an &quot;all-important principle&quot; that governs everything going on in the weird universe of this book, but who&#039;s also totally unable to really accurately say what it is or what it might mean in practice. It turns out usually--though definitely not always; &quot;shifgrethor can be played on the level of ethics,&quot; too (106)--to mean something like the secret rules that govern conversation, something like etiquette. The conversation at Genly&#039;s dinner with Estraven--which is the ostensible context and impetus for Genly&#039;s first defining &quot;shifgrethor&quot;--gets revisited several times in the book, with the common realization between the two characters that neither really had any idea at the time what the other was saying.&lt;br /&gt;
	The other salient example is the phenomenon of mindspeech, which is, of course, alien to Gethen, but which Genly Ai introduces at least to Estraven. The experience turns out to be wildly uncomfortable for Estraven, whose socially ingrained mode of communication involves what Genly Ai charitably calls &quot;reserve&quot; (255). The idea is that all Gethenians are going to hate mindspeech because it doesn&#039;t allow for falsification, for the sort of rhetorical play that &quot;shifgrethor&quot; necessarily entails. This tells us two things: (1) socially, and specifically with respect to Gethenian cultures, lying is a lot more comfortable than telling the truth, and pure meaning sort of sucks; and (2) objectively, throughout the universe of TLHoD, it&#039;s the transmutation--transubstantiation?--of ideas into words that allows for the fucking up of meaning.&lt;br /&gt;
	Genly Ai observes all of this about Gethenian culture. He observes that obfuscating rhetoric is absolutely the cultural norm. He also points out one really weird counterexample--of Kundershaden, the prison, he says: &quot;[i]t is what it looks like and is called. It is a jail. It is not a front for something else, not a faÃ§ade, not a pseudonym. It is real, the real thing, the thing behind the words&quot; (166). Aside from the fact that this seems to be making a sort of stupid and demonstrably false assumption about how language signifies, what I find really interesting here is that the only physical, cultural counterexample that Genly seems to be able to hit upon is a prison. I&#039;m not really sure what to make of this. In his experience, the only thing that is cold and hard and not covered up by the play of language is the locus of state power.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s in a name?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/110</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The reader is introduced to THT&#039;s patronymic naming system via &quot;newness&quot; in the SF-specific, Huntingtonian sense. In the first section, we are clued in to the fact that something is awry in the book&#039;s world, naming-wise, by the sort of ominous catalogue of pedestrian Catholic school-girl-sounding names: &quot;Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June&quot; (4). (&quot;Aunt&quot; seems like a strange title, too, but there are other things to worry about for the moment.) This is then followed by the introduction of Rita the Martha.: &quot;Rita is in here, standing at the kitchen table, which has a top of chipped white enamel. She&#039;s in her usual Martha&#039;s dressâ€¦. She puts on the veil to go outside, but nobody much cares who sees the face of a Martha&quot; (9). Here, we find a recognizable use of naming paired with an unrecognizable use of naming, so that we know that certain names are used in the same way in this world as they are in our world, and certain names are used very differently. What, we wonder, is a Martha?&lt;br /&gt;
	In the same chapter, we&#039;re introduced to Serena Joy, the Commander&#039;s Wife. At this point in the novel, it seems pretty clear that the improbable name &quot;Serena Joy&quot; is a stage name from &quot;The Growing Souls Gospel Hour&quot; (16). In the rest of the novel, though, she still bears the same name, and there is never any attempt to delve into the matter further.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then, finally, amid this small amount of name-related confusion, we get introduced to the patronymic naming system: &quot;Her name is Ofglen, and that&#039;s about all I know about her&quot; (19). This is sort of a tricky way for Atwood to have gone about this business, since &quot;Ofglen&quot; is less immediately transparent than, say, &quot;Ofcharles&quot; or even &quot;Ofwayne&quot;--it is more than possible, that is, to look at the word &quot;Ofglen&quot; and see only a weird, quasi-Nordic name, without yet discerning the system and its purpose. It is also important, I think, that Ofglen&#039;s name is presented as an absolute fact--&quot;that&#039;s about all I know about her.&quot; Ultimately, it will become clear that to give &quot;Ofglen&quot; as Ofglen&#039;s name is to give a sort of misinformation. She surely does have another, real name. It&#039;s simply the case that the narrator isn&#039;t privy to this information. But--strangely, I think--she doesn&#039;t seem concerned by this.&lt;br /&gt;
The scene in the Milk and Honey store is the first time that real information about how naming is worked gets revealed to the reader. This makes a certain amount of sense, since this is also the first instance of significant social interaction. First, there&#039;s the revelation that places can&#039;t really conceivably be named in words but must instead be named with pictures--&quot;Our first stop is at a store with another wooden sign: three eggs, a bee, a cow. Milk and Honey&quot; (25). The naming of women gets revealed in a way that looks incidental--via gossip: &quot;&#039;Who is it?&#039; I hear behind me. &#039;Ofwayne. No. Ofwarren&#039;&quot; (26). It takes the juxtaposition of these two names--in conjunction with the already-given &quot;Ofglen&quot;--to solidify our understanding of what&#039;s going on as far as women&#039;s names.	This is exactly the sort of principle of &quot;newness&quot; that Huntington points out as in Neuromancer. First, the reader is introduced into a system that feels somehow foreign or different but that is not explained in detail. It works sort of like Kafka, in a way--we just have to accept the information given to us. But, unlike in Kafka, things eventually get explained, get reordered into a system that, while still unfamiliar, seems at least logical.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think what remains sort of disturbing or sinister about naming in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is that none of it is ever fully explained. The new system is never fully revealed. We never know, for instance, what Offred&#039;s &quot;real&quot; name was. (And even her patronymic seems hopelessly vague: just as &quot;Ofglen&quot; looks in a certain sense opaque to me, I can&#039;t look at &quot;Offred&quot; and not read &quot;Off-red,&quot; as in the color--the color of the handmaids&#039; dresses, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;
Even the &quot;Historical Notes&quot; section seems perplexed by the amount of information we get: &quot;She does not see fit to supply us with her original nameâ€¦. The other names in the document are equally useless for the purposes of identification and authentication. &#039;Luke&#039; and &#039;Nick&#039; drew blanks, as did &#039;Moira&#039; and &#039;Janine.&#039; There is a high probability that these were, in any case, pseudonyms&quot; (306). Far from comforting or explanatory, the historical notes further undermine whatever sense of confidence or normality we might have found in, e.g., Moira&#039;s name.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Buggery in Ender&#039;s Game</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/88</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether anyone else read Ender&#039;s Game with Starship Troopers this semester--or had read it before--but I just read this interesting post on the Feminist SF blog--I was actually linked to it from Paper Cuts--about Orson Scott Card&#039;s winning the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which, I also learned, is some sort of important lifetime achievement award for YA lit. The thrust of the post is that Card is a horrible bigot and shouldn&#039;t be touted as a credible voice for young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a link to the post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot; title=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot;&gt;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&lt;/a&gt;. It has some quotations from essays and stuff that Card has written that are really awful and disgustingly homophobic. If you&#039;re interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, I thought, was this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;al Says:&lt;br /&gt;
January 29th, 2008 at 2:32 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i knew he was a homophobe before i read ender&#039;s game, but i still read it on someone&#039;s recommendation. i thought it was pretty interesting that the bad guys were referred to as &quot;buggers&quot; and that it found it&#039;s way to being a slur amongst the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, i know they were &#039;bugs&#039;. but there is no way osc didn&#039;t know what buggery (and buggers) was.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can&#039;t fathom how I missed that one. The phrase is so clearly sexual. And there&#039;s loads of (occasionally naked) homoerotic boy-play in the Battle School. Most of it more or less innocuous, though, which is interesting, given Card&#039;s self-professed beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s anything productive to be done with this in Starship Troopers--the word in Ender&#039;s Game is also clearly a reference to the bad guys in ST--but if anyone wants to take a shot at it, I&#039;d be interested to see what we could come up with, readings-wise.  We talked a lot about gendered readings of ST, but not so much about the potential for queer readings. Not sure how much potential there is, but I thought I&#039;d throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Limits of Alienation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/68</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The claim has been made that Neuromancer celebrates in a way previously unattested to in the annals of SF the existence of mind without body. While I am not wholly convinced of this, I think the secondary readings that we had this week offer a window to a reading that balances on the scales of class the consideration given by the novel to the possibility of thinking without feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
	Both Huntington and Olsen observe cyberpunk&#039;s particular investment in a social &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;underclass&quot;: &quot;Neorealists focus on the trials and tribulations of the spoiled homogeneous upper middle class; cyberpunks explore the heterogeneous fringes of our culture&quot; (Olsen 148); &quot;The class-generated structure of feeling that we seek to uncover reveals itself not in the concrete surface references but in the formal structure of the work&quot; (Huntington 136). Here, Huntington is clearly referring to &quot;newness&quot; as a formal property of the text; Olsen would probably think that narrative disjunction is the more salient formal property. Both properties, in both these essays, have the effect of situating the reader on the outside of the social structure in a way that&#039;s typically postmodern. (In fact, &quot;newness&quot; as Huntington describes it might be the same thing as &quot;narrative disjunction&quot;--which might be a better rebuttal to his claims, it seems to me, than the argument that &quot;cyberspace&quot; has become too familiar to be &quot;new.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
The book seems to advocate in favor of the mind without the body with respect (1) to the main character&#039;s affinity for cyberspace (2) to the main character&#039;s affinity for psychotropic drugs. Essentially, drugs and cyberspace seem to do exactly the same things for Case. Each of these examples is coded according to class.&lt;br /&gt;
To the first claim: In Neuromancer, drug use is equivalent to engagement in cyberspace is equivalent to the escape of the mind from the body. When Case describes his longing for cyberspace following his neurological maiming, it sounds exactly like drug withdrawal: &quot;He&#039;d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bed slab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (5). When Armitage arranges for Case&#039;s inability to get high, he equates the one activity with the other: &quot;&#039;Thanks but I was enjoying that dependency.&#039; &#039;Good, because you have a new one&#039;&quot; (45). Conversely, when Case starts using the drug betaphenethylamine (which conveniently bypasses his new pancreas and liver), the effects of the drug are always described as an escape from the flesh to the mechanical: &quot;His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed and polished&quot; (154); &quot;The high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly, flesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of his life&quot; (155). The phrase &quot;drug-flesh&quot; clearly delineates the extent to which drug usage--like the engagement of cyberspace--is opposed to fleshly existence. (In Neuromancer, the act of singing on to cyberspace is called &quot;jacking in&quot;; the TV show Futurama has a pretty good reading of this phrase and activity, actually: Bender the robot becomes addicted to the illicit use of electricity, which is called &quot;jacking on.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
	 That these examples are coded socially is somewhat more difficult to demonstarate. Both the Huntington and Olsen articles, to the extent that each is interested in class, point out that part of the difficulty of seeing class difference in a text that is committed to some (in this case, I would argue, many) aspects of postmodern representation is that the social order tends to be meaningfully obscured. Thus, the only real instance in Neuromancer in which we get a glimpse of a social group that&#039;s not clearly identifiable as &quot;fringe&quot;--as Huntington notes--is the Tessier-Ashpool aristocracy. They are, of course, users of many and varied drugs. The difference is that for them--and this is essentially all I have to aver in favor of my argument--is that drugs simply don&#039;t work; 3Jane: &quot;I find drug use in general to be boring&quot; (228). Ashpool is surrounded by drugs, true; but he is miserable, whereas Case is genuinely fond of both his addictions.&lt;br /&gt;
	In this case, the book&#039;s advocacy of a total split between the mind and the body might be a sort of Marxian parody via an extreme limit of alienation. As in, the only way to beat American capitalism is to beat it at its own game. If you live only in your mind, can you still be alienated from your labor?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Signifying Absences: Amputation in Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/34</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(By way of a response) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The hand he had offered me was the one that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several amputees are featured prominently in Starship Troopers. This is not exactly surprising; the dangerous combat and training to which &quot;cap troopers&quot; are subjected result in frequent death and maiming. The specific mention of people&#039;s amputated limbs serves a couple different purposes that are immediately distinguishable: on the one hand (pun regrettably intended), there is the Fleet Sergeant Ho model, in which the amputated limb is a warning, a &quot;horror show&quot; (39); on the other hand, there is the Dubois model, in which a nonlimb is displayed prominently as a badge or marker denoting experience, sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is careful not to lay out these two alternate significances too schematically. Chronologically, the first amputee whom Johnnie encounters is Mr. Dubois, the History and Moral Philosophy teacher. Of Mr. Dubois Johnny recalls: &quot;He would just point at you with the stump of his left armâ€¦&quot; (25). Clearly, Mr. Dubois cannot fall under the &quot;horror show&quot; category--although Johnnie does claim that Mr. Dubois &quot;discourages&quot; his students from serving (23). However, it is somewhat misleading to say that Mr. Dubois is the paradigmatic example of the missing-limb-as-ultimate-badge-of-honor character, if only because Johnnie does not immediately recognize what, exactly, Mr. Dubois&#039;s missing limb means--that is, Johnnie does not know until much later exactly how much experience Dubois had, how much he sacrificed. When Johnnie is in boot camp, he receives a letter from Dubois, the signature of which bears a surprisingly high rank: &quot;We supposed (if we thought about it at all) that he must have been a corporal or some such who had been let out when he lost his hand and had been fixed up with a soft job teaching a course that didn&#039;t have to be passedâ€¦&quot; (91). Dubois&#039;s rank--Lieutenant Colonel--raises his status in Johnnie&#039;s eyes, such that Dubois&#039;s having taken a job teaching high school suddenly seems to him sort of heroic, rather than an easy retirement option; such that Dubois&#039;s amputated limb becomes not a mere ticket to a &quot;soft job&quot; but a distinguishing sign of &quot;honor.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading of characters&#039; phantom limbs is more immediately accessible both to Johnnie--and, by proxy, to the reader--when Johnnie reaches officers&#039; training: &quot;Most of the instructors, especially the officers, were disabled. The only ones I can remember who had a full complement of arms, legs, eyesight, hearing, etc., were some of the non-commissioned combat instructors--and not all of those&quot; (174). Johnnie&#039;s thinking at this point parallels neatly with the thoughts of his high-school self: &quot;At first I wondered why those obvious candidates for physical retirement and full-pay pension didn&#039;t take it and go home. Then I quit wondering&quot; (174). At first blush, &quot;Then I quit wondering&quot; sounds sort of like &quot;if we thought about it at all.&quot; However, in the later case, Johnnie recognizes in his instructors&#039; actions the &quot;virtuous&quot; tautology of military service; MI fight because they are MI, we are repeatedly reminded; so, too, Johnnie concludes, it can be said only that his instructors did not retire because they are not retirees. Point being, Johnnie stops thinking about their reasoning not because he doesn&#039;t care but because he recognizes the valor that inheres in these men&#039;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in the second model is the violence of war--the fact that necessitates or realizes amputation--actually implied. The second model is peculiar, too, because singular and short-lived: Fleet Sergeant Ho is the only given example of the Fleet Sergeant Ho model: &quot;A fleet sergeant sat at a desk there, in dress uniform, gaudy as a circus. His chest was loaded with ribbons I couldn&#039;t read. But his right arm was off so short that his tunic had been tailored without any sleeve at allâ€¦and, when you came up to the rail, you could see that he had no legs&quot; (28). Although Johnnie says that &quot;it doesn&#039;t seem to bother&quot; Ho very much, it does make an impression on Johnnie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days later, Johnnie meets the same man outside the recruiting station, walking and gesturing with a full set of prostheses: &quot;I don&#039;t have to put on my horror show after working hours,&quot; he explains to Johnnie (39). Here, the second model collapses into the first; Ho congratulates Johnnie on joining the MI, shakes hands with him using a prosthetic limb, and Johnnie, only briefly &quot;horrified,&quot; never looks back.&lt;/p&gt;
