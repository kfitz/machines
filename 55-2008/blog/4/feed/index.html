 <title>Last Man Standing</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/342</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What I found most captivating about Oryx and Crake was the total sense of isolation that saturates the book.  The narrative helps in creating this sensation of loneliness because the reader is kept ignorant of the most recent events of Snowman&#039;s past up until the very last pages of the book.  As we go along, we have the two separate periods of narration â€“ Jimmy&#039;s childhood and family issues, leading to meeting Crake and school, etc. and then Snowman&#039;s present.  As we get glimpses of Snowman post-apocalypse, we also relive with him his nostalgia and visit to the events of the past with each memory in chronological order.  Until finally, Jimmy becomes Snowman and the two narratives find one another in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire book is narrated by Snowman, and aside from superficial insights into the characters of Oryx and Crake (and perhaps even the parental figures of Jimmy and Crake), his is the only point of view we experience throughout the book.  When we see him react to creations like the ChickieNobs, we understand how to react.  And in his adolescent period when he is playing games with Crake and watching bizarre porn and executions on the internet, the reader sees that there are distinct differences between our reality and his.  While Snowman is not the most agreeable or inspirational character, the reader identifies with him, partly because we adore flawed heroes, but also because, honestly, he&#039;s our only choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Atwood depicts this type of post-apocalyptic devastation creates a truly haunting vision of the future, that is a little too easy to picture.  The sensations of being abandoned by one&#039;s entire species can really be felt by the reader because the only characters we ever meet are in Jimmy&#039;s head and they are repeatedly made surreal and mirage-like.  The Crakers only help in the most primitive way, appealing to Snowman&#039;s need to be with others, feel human touch, and to speak, to remember the words he used to worship (even though the Crakers have no understanding or context for most of them).  Atwood beautifully conveys the emptiness that Snowman feels, realistically simulating the waves of semi-contentment and total despair at the reality of his situation.  It seems to be a common trope of science fiction, but also the genre of zombie movies, to create a fiction in which the hero is alone, isolated, and facing the extinction of all human beings should he/she fail.  In the film Resident Evil: Extinction, there is a similar landscape, dry and exceedingly hot, with supplies, food, and weapons rapidly diminishing while the enemy grows.  Snowman&#039;s only enemies were hunger, madness, and the wildlife (including the marauding bands of pigs with people parts).  Obviously, within the context of action films the main character, Alice, has superhuman characteristics and the audience knows from the start that she will triumph over her obstacles.  Part of the appeal of Snowman is that he is Everyman, John Smith, a neurotypical, with absolutely no exceptional skills, no super-attuned senses of physical abilities and there is no certain prediction for his future within this miserable shell of the former world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems particularly upsetting that there is no Hollywood resolution to this book, although it would be difficult to imagine how such a fictional space could have a happy ending.  Even though the book ends incredibly abruptly, with many possibilities and questions for the immediate future, the resolution of the two stories into one at least provides a narrative closure and a degree of satisfaction with how the story concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unfortunately uninspired</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/324</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So as much as I enjoyed the book I can&#039;t think of anything to add to what I said about it last Monday in class.  As much as I would love to scrutinize the mantra &quot;He took a duck in the face at two hundred and fifty knots&quot; I&#039;m finding myself particularly dry on creativity (101).  I think it&#039;s all been poured into my thesis.  I promise I&#039;ll have something fascinating to say about Oryx and Crake :-D&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ultimate Tree House People</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/295</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon reading a science fiction book that creates a new sentient species, it is always interesting to consider how that species differs from humans, as the departure from a human model is a commentary on how the author views humankind.  Specifically, it usually points out the perceived flaws in human interactions, politics, overall behavior, and response to environment.  In creating the douen as a sentient race, which were already a well-established myth in Caribbean culture (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&quot; title=&quot;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&quot;&gt;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&lt;/a&gt;), Hopkinson continued her pattern of using folk lore and mythical characters as main players in her book, but redefined, showing the myths as extrapolated from a more science fiction type truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was touched on somewhat briefly in class on Monday, the treatment of the Douen by the exiled Toussaint humans echoed the African slave experience and illuminated the way in which humans manage to come up with irrational validation to treat others as sub-human.  Little Tan-Tan was so surprised at the use of &quot;master&quot; towards the humans, when Chichibud says it, because she sees Chichibud as just another kind of person.  She had not yet learned the human tendency to equate difference with inferiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about the douen that was interesting was the drastic difference between male and female within the species.  In superficially examining this difference, Hopkinson&#039;s purpose is unclear (at least to me).  As a species the distinctions are very useful because the humans do not expect such a deviation based on gender within a species, since it is difficult to think of a single species on Earth that varies that much within itself based on sex.  Also, from a practical perspective, the ability to use them as pack animal, transportation, protection, sonic weapon, radar, and manufacturer of trade goods, is indispensable.  It can be supposed that from a biological perspective the split of male as reptilian and female as bird is not completely removed from the realm of possibility, considering the study of dinosaurs being closely related to reptiles and birds.  There is a magical component in the douen culture, even though Chichibud&#039;s initial claims of magic turn out to have been stories for the young Tan-Tan.  There was the medicine, which is so much more affective than the medicine the Toussaint people used.  The daddy tree was also somewhat magical, providing for virtually all of the needs of the douen people in a perfectly symbiotic relationship.  Specifically the absence of technology in the douen culture makes them seem more magical, as other alien species are traditionally reliant on technological advancement for their super human abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of existing myths to build a species must have made Hopkinson&#039;s job somewhat easier, but they do depart drastically from the original lore.  However, the use of folk lore enriched her creations and her story by creating a many layered mythology within the book&#039;s fiction that seems to become deeper the more one knows about Caribbean culture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>MMORPG&#039;s: A blur between reality and virtual reality is already here</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/262</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a combination of theories and ideas that have been thrown around in a variety of classes, I have found myself writing a screenplay treatment that centers on the concept of virtual reality and the place of identity.  An interesting theme that arises in Snow Crash, eXistenZ, and Neuromancer is the complications involved in creating a virtual version of oneself.  In Snow Crash, there is the scene where Hiro engages in a sword fight with someone in the Black Sun.  His avatar in the Metaverse was manipulating his own code in order to defeat his opponent, while his physical form in actual reality was carrying out the movements necessary for the battle, whence the unnerved audience he had when he had finished.  One of the confusions of movement in the Metaverse is how the characters are controlled, as it seems they can walk around, ride motorcycles, and be moved by other avatars with only their mind control, but for the intricacies of sword play, the physical body must move.  However, for the most part, Hiro creates a copy of himself to wander around the Metaverse, somewhat in the capacity of a vehicle through virtual reality.&lt;br /&gt;
eXistenZ takes a very different approach to VR.  Considering the bioports and the game console situation within the game with the animal part pods, the whole situation revolves around an actual interface with the body involving connection through blood and tissue.  You do not create a new character, but have your own body, just the way it appears in reality.  The way this vision of VR functions it comes off as more of a controlled hallucination or specifically engineered dream experience than the slightly less &quot;realistic&quot; VR of Snow Crash.  There is very little control on the part of the player and one feels entirely ruled by the story line of the game.&lt;br /&gt;
The way I see Neuromancer relating to this is in the concept of the Construct.  Somehow, in Gibson&#039;s view of the future of virtual realities and technology, a person&#039;s personality, their identity (up to a certain point) can be saved onto what equates to a floppy disk and moved around, loaded onto computers and forced to exist in cyberspace without a body like some kind of technological limbo.  While the Flatline had no concept of time, he was more than just a conglomeration of the former being&#039;s memories and skills, he also had the sense of humor, a laugh (as disconcerting as it may have been to Case) and the desire to be erased, released from the cyberspace cage in which he was saved.&lt;br /&gt;
I find all three of these versions of VR to be fascinating, and elements of each are incorporated into my idea of VR in my screenplay.  The character wrote her own VR world as an escape, a nostalgic playground to represent all that the current government structure had taken away.  It plays with the conflict between controlling the image of oneself, as Hiro does, and also the surreal interplay between cyberspace and real life, where it becomes uncertain whether one&#039;s involvement with a virtual world can be more real than the real world because of the importance placed in time spent there and one&#039;s identity in that space.  Dixie had no choice about his personality being saved, and when he was consulted, he chose to be released.  However, in eXistenZ, the lines between reality and the virtual game reality were so badly blurred that it became almost impossible to distinguish them.  When the American Jude Law character came out of the game within a game for the first time he found that it all felt unreal and he experienced extreme disorientation.  Having had periods of my life where I could play six to eight straight hours of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), it seems that the level of technology in these books and movies is unnecessary for one to lose the connection between mind and body, neglecting the physical reality and placing the needs of the virtual character first.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Gray-haired Burden</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/233</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since it has not really been addressed yet, the question of race in Slow River is a very interesting one.  As someone else mentioned, the gender dynamic is a departure from what we have been reading because Griffith creates an arguably homonormative environment where Lore&#039;s life is inundated with lesbian friends and even an uncle with a husband, demonstrating the total acceptance of gay marriage in this society.  As far as race, it is not an issue in any of the main or love interest characters.  The character of Paolo and the parts of the narrative of Lore&#039;s past that set up his identification are the most notable admission of the existence of non-White individuals in the van de Oest world.  In other areas of the novel, countries are mentioned where the van de Oest family has projects going on, including local labor disputes and the outcry after the Caracas affair.  But as far as being a central theme of the book, race is simply not as important to Griffith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this is perhaps done on purpose by Griffith.  Since we see the story through Lore&#039;s eyes and are repeatedly reminded of how her family operates, it may be a way to demonstrate the non-existence of Other to the van de Oest family.  While Lore did her best to educate herself and read about the biological intricacies of the family business, anything so outlandish as ethics or anthropological studies seem to have been left out.  As far as the corporation is concerned, the people of Caracas are relatively inconsequential to the long lasting goals of their remediation projects, and more honestly, their goals of protecting their monopoly by creating dependent bugs.  This lack of concern for fellow human beings is especially apparent in the character of Greta, who sells, and essentially destroys, her sister&#039;s life in order to secure the financial future of a particular project which is only a part of the family&#039;s business.  This forces the reader to understand in no uncertain terms that the family has not sought to inspire a significant moral compass in their offspring, as the pursuit of morals and the pursuit of insane wealth rarely seem compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the idea of race in the book, one might also consider the more general pattern of identifying people based on physical characteristics.  Socially, we are trained to read certain traits and assign people labels, slip them into categories based on the shape of a nose, the color of skin, or the size and shape of eyes.  Interestingly, the labels and categories do vary depending on country, but it seems to be more of an overarching theme of human nature to label and categorize.  The idea of the gray hair as a new symbol of wealth was an interesting choice for Griffith and seemed to be her way of hammering home the arrangement of priorities for the van de Oest family.  In some ways they become their own race (or they have just excused themselves from being labeled along with anyone else).  They certainly have their own laws, codes of moral conduct, recognizable physical characteristic, and financial authority.  It seems after muddling through these ideas that, like issues of gender, race is not a theme in Slow River in the way we have been examining it in past books.  However, the point of the van de Oest family is that they have made themselves an island, and all those apart from the island are Other, which as a concept certainly lends itself to an analogy of White Americans against the rest of the (specifically non-Western) world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler uses dialogue throughout the book to say a great deal more than one would initially interpret.  She uses the Oankali and their projected image of omniscience to convey criticism of humanity and our civilization, even in situations where the Human culture is not specifically under scrutiny.  Less helpful to the story is her tendency to constantly ram the &quot;Human Conflict/Contradiction&quot; down the throats of her readers, yet never properly investigating just what is so flawed in it.  Because so much of the trilogy deals with the indoctrination of Humans or the raising and educating of children, there is a lot of room for explanation to the reader and we often hear the same situation explained from multiple perspectives.  This method of getting information to the reader is interesting because it points out the contradictions the Oankali are responsible for and the subtle manipulation and destructive lies through omission.  Much of the Oankali deception is only a suspicion until the third book, where the reader gets a very in depth view into Jodahs&#039; reality and how he twists people to match his will.  The concept of love in these inter-species relationships is completely dismissed, Lilith herself even says at one point that it&#039;s only a matter of pheromones, and that becomes absolute fact when we experience Jodahs&#039; perspective.  As far as Jodahs and Aaor were concerned it seemed not to matter at all which pair of Humans were chosen as mates, just that they found two warm bodies of roughly the right age.  Love is occasionally mentioned, but quite frankly it seems to exist more to point out just how ridiculous that concept is with the degree of control the Oankali and constructs have over the Human perception of reality, than as any kind of serious statement.&lt;br /&gt;
	One passage of Adulthood Rites that really stood out as saying more than it seems was when Akin and Tiikuchahk were on the shuttle to Chkahichdahk with Dichaan.  Dichaan allowed Akin to &quot;taste the ship&#039;s perceptions&quot; and then offered to do the same with Tiikuchahk (444).  Tiikuchahk asks its sibling whether or not it should also have this experience, as it had clearly been painful to Akin and it is Akin&#039;s response that is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.  &quot;Do it.  It hurts, and you won&#039;t like it, but there&#039;s something more in it than pain, something you won&#039;t feel until afterward.  I think maybeâ€¦maybe it&#039;s a shadow of the way it will be for us when we&#039;re adult and able to perceive directly.  It&#039;s worth what it costs, worth reaching for.&quot; (444)&lt;br /&gt;
This passage not only answers Tiikuchahk, but also answers how the Oankali, and constructs who are sufficiently swayed by the Oankali way, feel about hybridizing humanity.  From their perspective Humans should breed with them, sign over their free will and reproductive abilities.  It will hurt.  They will go against their better judgment and resent their own weakness â€“ not realizing just how little choice they had in the first place.  But the Oankali and constructs are convinced that the trade is the correct choice and in the end the Humans will understand that the preservation of even the remotest slice of humanity is worth losing all trace of what Humans had once been.  Even though Oankali explain throughout the book their reasons for the trade, their efforts to make Humans happy and save them from extinction, this passage seems to offer clarity of opinion that seems different from the more outright declarations in the book.  For some reason this statement, that is not even about directly about Humans, explains the essence of the Oankali reason for continuing to force themselves on humankind against their wishes because of a belief that the pain is &quot;worth what it costs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Handdara Philosophy and Atheism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/131</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To examine a part of the book I feel was ignored in discussion on Monday, I wanted to explore my interest in the Handdara and their philosophy.  The whole concept of Foretelling is fascinating, especially as it is practiced in a religious society that considers it to be a completely fruitless exercise.  There is a point early on in the book when Genly is talking with Faxe about the process of Foretelling and how useful it is, but Faxe is trying to get Genly to understand him.  Faxe says &quot;â€¦we in the Handdara don&#039;t want answers.  It&#039;s hard to avoid them, but we try to.&quot; (70)  When I first considered this statement I thought that the goal of many religions is to find answers, and in this the Handdara are set apart.  However, upon closer examination of prominent organized religions, definite answers are never the goal.  If it could be answered whether or not Jesus Christ actually lived and the stories of the New Testament were true, would any Christian honestly want to know?  The point is faith, the belief that something is so, even if proof is out of the question.  Faxe expresses some degree of exasperation with Genly&#039;s questions about Foretelling and finally asks Genly &quot;you don&#039;t see yetâ€¦why we perfected and practice Foretelling?&quot; and Faxe goes on to answer his own question, &quot;to exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the wrong question.&quot;  (70)  Taking the earlier example of the existence or non-existence in actual history of Jesus, one sees that the answer to that question is immaterial, as there are so many other questions which would be more useful if answered.  For example, would Christ&#039;s alleged teachings, if truly followed by all mankind, be the answer to world peace and global unconditional human love and kindness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Handdara respect ignorance because it is the only thing that we can count on as constant, apart from death, which few people hurry towards.  At the end of the chapter, Faxe lays the philosophy of the Handdara out in plain language for Genly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The unknownâ€¦the unforetold, the unproven, that is what life is based on.  Ignorance is the ground of thought.  Unproof is the ground of action.  If it were proven that there is no God there would be no religionâ€¦but also if it were proven that there is a God, there would be no religion.&quot; (71)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much later in the book, during one of Estraven&#039;s journal entries, he suggests &quot;to be an atheist is to maintain God.  His existence or his nonexistence, it amounts to much the same, on the plane of proof&quot; (153).  Here, Le Guin inserts her own beliefs, as she stated in the foreword that she is herself an atheist.  It seems unusual for an author to openly question, or rather examine in a virtually unbiased fashion, her own beliefs through the characters she has created.  She brings up such unusual and controversial issues, and manages to look at this society, without stable gender, through its own eyes.  Questioning the human desire to know, especially creating a religious group that gives importance and prominence to ignorance, is an incredible exercise in stepping outside one&#039;s own beliefs and taking a very critical look at society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gethenians and Bugs</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I had been pondering in class, but didn&#039;t really get around to talking about was a comparison between the Bugs of Starship Troopers and the Gethenians.  I was considering how we responded very differently, as did the protagonists, to the bugs and the Gethenians and what some of the factors are that go into that.  In class we were describing the Gethenians as so very different from us, but at the same time, according to Le Guin&#039;s constructed biological family tree both the people of Terran and the people of Gethen were descended from the same people of Hain, and Genly can &quot;pass&quot; as being a native of the planet, if a slightly strange one.  (That also brings up the idea of &quot;passing,&quot; which is an incredibly loaded discussion both in considering race and gender/sexuality, but I don&#039;t have the stamina or inclination to go there right now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bugs had a similarly binary sexuality, even though separated by caste, so there were the drones and warriors - who we assume are male - and then the queen, obviously female.  Perhaps it is that the Bugs were so much like insects that we barely compared them to ourselves, but it struck me as strange that we mentioned how different the Gethenians were when Estraven states that from a visible standpoint, and even in some cultural aspects, they&#039;re extremely similar, it&#039;s the inner biology that so very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if this makes sense to anyone else, but it stuck out as a thought during discussion today that we seemed more comfortable with the idea of an insect race of aliens with identifiable and stable genders that we can clearly categorize and compare to something familiar.  And we seemed highly uncomfortable with the idea of this fluctuating gender and the accompanying foreign changes that result from it in society, even though solely by physical appearance the Gethenians should have been so much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d be happy to hear any thoughts, as mine aren&#039;t really formed into a single cohesive argument at all.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ten seconds&#039; worth of half babies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/101</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This Margaret Atwood book, having such an intensely gendered agenda, is sometimes confusing to the reader and the author&#039;s opinions, as expressed through different characters, seem to mislead the reader as to her own opinions about feminism and a potential utopian order for the world.  Specifically, it was difficult to piece together exactly what her mother&#039;s position had been in terms of the protests and issues like abortion and pornography, although less so with the pornography as there is the scene where Offred&#039;s mother burns it.  At one point the mother talks about being called a &quot;pronatalist&quot; by her friends because she wants to have a baby and it is difficult to tell exactly for what reasons this is such a horrific thing.  Other places in the book other characters mention the women who realized the infertility problem and gave up trying, and perhaps this is the group that Offred&#039;s mother was involved with.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to cite specific parts of this book without having excessively marked up the text while reading, as the nature of the narrative is that it hops frequently between past and present in no predictable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular passage where Offred is reliving a conversation with her mother stands out as an interesting set of beliefs about women and their place in the world.  The scene begins with a description of the mother being over for dinner around Offred and Luke.  A discussion of why she refuses to dye her hair is what launches the mother&#039;s tirade.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;What do I need it for, I don&#039;t want a man around, what use are they except for ten seconds&#039; worth of half babies.  A man is just a woman&#039;s strategy for making other womenâ€¦just do the job, then you can bugger off, I said, I make a decent salary, I can afford daycare.&quot; (120-121)&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly she has respect for men as producers of sperm, but little else.  As if to support the Commander&#039;s claim to Offred during one of their chats, the mother suggests that the feeling had gone from their society and any idea of love was the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Atwood uses the figure of the mother to play the stereotype of the feminist, the feared, illogical and outspoken feminist that most other women with the occasional feminist thought consider when denying the label &quot;feminist&quot;.  And yet even hidden amongst stereotypically hostile statements, the mother sometimes makes logical points â€“ or the beginnings of them â€“ so she is not rendered a completely ridiculous character.  Instead she could be a method for Atwood to deliver certain ideas with immunity, having a character like this to hide behind.  The reverse sexism is evident in comments from the mother such as, &quot;it&#039;s like they&#039;re permanently absent-mindedâ€¦they aren&#039;t a patch on women except they&#039;re better at fixing cars and playing football, just what we need for the improvement of the human race, right?&quot; (121).  This sentiment mirrors the statements made by men about women throughout history suggesting a lack of intelligence and a strict limitation to only a very few activities they may do better than men.  Considering the impression given by the book as a whole, it is still difficult to pin down where Atwood stands.  She does present this extreme feminist activist, but at the same time, belittles her in many ways and renders her somewhat comical.  There are many layers to the gender conflict in this book, but without more in depth study of other characters and specifically how they interplay in the mind of Offred, Atwood&#039;s intentional message remains somewhat mystifying.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In the vein of infertility in sci-fi...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/87</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in class, the movie Aeon Flux covers some very similar points but deals with the ideas of infertility in a very different way.  While The Handmaid&#039;s Tale deals mainly with white infertility in a single country, Aeon Flux addresses the idea of global infertility, not blamed on either gender, and the increasingly strict and regulated society that results from that infertility.  I feel like it was passed over when it came out, but I think it&#039;s pretty relevant to both The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and Children of Men.  Definitely more socially classified as science fiction as well with the presence of exciting technology.  It&#039;s also a really entertaining movie and I&#039;m a sucker for the love story.  So really no reason not to watch it, I know you&#039;ll all be dying to procrastinate at some point this week.  Enjoy :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Place of Language in the (Non-)Reality of Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/56</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is a novel that could be discussed at great length in pretty much any context because he has filled it with some extremely complicated characters in a very elaborate context.  One benefit of his choice to mainly depict the areas of Biz and criminal activities is that he has created such a rich image of this one aspect of Case&#039;s reality, and it alludes to an even bigger world image that is often suggested in casual comments throughout the book and also all of the scenes set in Freeside.  While he often leaves the reader dangling in terms of defining technology and any kind of easily visualized concept of geography, his descriptions are quite possibly the most fantastic constant.  When discussing such complex and previously unconsidered ideas as a portable reconstruction of a deceased human being&#039;s personality and skills that can virtually interact with reality on a certain level, Gibson could very easily confuse readers into putting the book down and never giving it another thought.&lt;br /&gt;
What keeps the reader&#039;s attention throughout the book&#039;s more challenging scenes is Gibson&#039;s ability to create such bizarre and vivid images.  He renders characters, both in their physical bodies and their personalities, with unconventional descriptors and sometimes paradoxical qualities.  Interestingly, he will use a highly descriptive passage and later, will revisit what he had been discussing with a casual throw away comment, often incorporating slang (either slang the reader is familiar with from reality, or his own fictional slang).  One example of this is when Gibson is describing Molly&#039;s pain as Case experienced it through the simstim connection.&lt;br /&gt;
	&quot;Case remembered the injection.  What had they given her?  The pain was still there, but it came through as a tight focus of scrambled impressions.  Neon worms writhing in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill--his mind recoiled from it.  If he avoided focusing on it, the impressions overlapped, became a sensory equivalent of white noise.&quot; (217-218)&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson&#039;s description of Molly&#039;s pain is still difficult to imagine and recreate in one&#039;s own sense memory, but his detail, the imagery he conjures to try to convey meaning to his audience is masterful.  On the other hand, earlier in roughly the same scene, Gibson has Wintermute speaking through the Finn and telling Case that &quot;Molly&#039;s leg&#039;s falling off for starts.  Can&#039;t walk.&quot; (216)  His balance of the colloquial dialogue of his characters and the extremely vivid and intricate descriptions he uses as narrator force the reader to remain entrenched in the personalities of the characters and the way they relate to the world, but also allow the reader to play with the idea of what these characters are experiencing.  When given an image like &quot;neon worms writhing in her thigh,&quot; the reader can only attempt to recreate that sensation, thereby relating more closely and realistically with the character.&lt;br /&gt;
	Gibson&#039;s use of these two methods of conveying information to the reader reinforces the overarching concept of reality and non-reality, the paradox of experience as virtual and/or &quot;real&quot;.  There is such a blurred line between what a character can be said to experience versus dreaming or imagining, and his language only enhances the reader&#039;s understanding of that.  The tangible and the intangible are at times inseparable in Case&#039;s experience and the contrast between the straight forward expressions of the characters and the convoluted, sensory descriptions in the narrative contribute to a confused sense of reality and experience in Gibson&#039;s futuristic space.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&lt;Insert witty title for my response here&gt;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/35</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In our Monday class, we touched on Heinlein&#039;s use of the History and Moral Philosophy teachers as voices of political commentary and social criticism.  As clumsy or obvious as that may have seemed, his choice to do this very much ties into the idea of Science Fiction as an unappreciated genre for commenting on society and our own culture by using distance, alien cultures and/or the passage of time to reflect from a simulated outside perspective.  The Freedman article definitely seemed like a stretch in some places, but both that and the Suvin were trying to highlight the place of Science Fiction in modern life and relate it to reality.  Much of the Sci-Fi that is readily available in the consumer market can be appreciated solely for its entertainment value and dismissed when one tries to wedge it into any kind of greater moral philosophy â€“ what comes to mind most readily being many of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books such as the Rogue Squadron series.  Interestingly, the original Star Wars movies are full of philosophy and commentary on the disconnection and contamination of the human mind.  Yoda comes up frequently in many non-Sci-Fi related theoretical discussions, at least in the mind of this nerd, because of some unexpectedly wise statements.  One that came to mind recently in a discussion of the body/mind conundrum was &quot;luminous beings are weâ€¦not this crude matter.&quot;  However, it seems that Science Fiction is often considered to be an entertainment genre and not worthy of greater study or dissection in order to assess a potentially richer commentary on our present society.  Certainly there are exceptions, for example, George Orwell&#039;s 1984 definitely can fit into the Sci-Fi category and is required reading for every school child.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, trying to return to a focus on Heinlein and his work, it was surprising, especially after watching the film as well, to consider the ideas of sexism.  While not considering myself an overly sensitive person, six semesters at Scripps teaches one to be aware of potential points of controversy from a feminist perspective.  Yet there seemed nothing overly offensive to women, nor anything to suggest that women had a limited place in Heinlein&#039;s concept of the future.  Heinlein, contrary to the movie version, does not include women in the M.I., but does not exclude them from the military in other areas, as was the case for all but nurses at the time he wrote the book.  At first his decision to have the women pilots shave their heads was confusing, but once explained it made perfect sense and highlighted some of the more ludicrous details of the film that separated from Heinlein&#039;s vision.  He also commented several times on the importance of women for morale purposes, simply their presence on ships boosted the interest of the men in fighting that much harder.  Knowing of his previous experience as a veteran himself, this was undoubtedly from deeply felt emotions of his own during that time and not intended to objectify or belittle women.  Perhaps it shows the absolute opposite, to elevate women and illuminate them as of great importance to society, the protection of the species and Man&#039;s necessity for a counterpart.  The concept of partnership was absent from the social hierarchy of the bugs, with the workers and soldiers being expendable and easily replaceable pawns for the Queen, or Queens, to dispose of as she saw fit.  The contrast of these two systems of procreation and gender roles served to point out the importance of Man&#039;s humanity, the value of the individual and the undying devotion to preserving the good parts of our society.  As a final side note, had the bugs had more &quot;human&quot; methods of relating to one another and perhaps possessed the ability to love, they would have been a much harder target to demonize and annihilate in the way that they were.&lt;/p&gt;
