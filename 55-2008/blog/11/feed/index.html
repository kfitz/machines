 <title>Evolution</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to discuss the significance of Crake&#039;s decisions on how to modify humanity.  It seems to me that, while his modifications were aimed at eliminating strife, the main result of his modifications were that he eliminated the part of humanity which causes strife, the main things he did was to eliminate the human capacity for progress.  This emerges in his discussion with Jimmy about sex.  Jimmy argues that by eliminating sexual frustration, he is eliminating art.  I think this actually applies to nearly all human endeavors, including government, science, commerce, etc.  Crake even confirms this indirectly by saying something like, wouldn&#039;t you always rather be fucking?  He ultimately implies that if there wasn&#039;t a sexual urge to make yourself more attractive, you wouldn&#039;t do it, and art, and by extension all other human endeavors I mentioned, wouldn&#039;t be made.  By limiting this capacity of humanity, it seems that he is dooming humanity to the same fate as the rest of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Math vs Language</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/344</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key theme in Margaret Atwood&#039;s Oryx and Crake  is the conflict between that which is empirically provable, and that which is a construct of the human mind.  This manifests in  a variety of ways: numbers vs. words, emotion vs. survival, art vs. science.  The protagonist, Jimmy/Snowman, is wrapped up in this conflict, because he is an advocate of the side which believes in the intangibles of human nature, but he feels like his side is losing, or has lost, depending on whether we address him before or after the catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;
	The conflict first emerges early in Jimmy&#039;s life in the guise of an innocent qualification.  He notices at a young age that Ramona talks as if she isn&#039;t very intelligent, but Jimmy&#039;s dad explains it away by saying that, &quot;she didn&#039;t want to put her neuron power into long sentences.&quot; (25)  Apparently, most people working at OrganInc behaved similarly, and it was because &quot;they were numbers people, not word people, [but] Jimmy already knew that he himself was not a numbers person.&quot; (25)  This statement seems innocuous at first: just a child realizing his strengths in language and weaknesses in mathematics.  Yet, as the story progresses, the emphasis on mathematical and logical competence in the compound increases.  As mentioned before, most of the employees of the compounds were oriented towards mathematical rather than verbal prowess, and as such, their children end up with the same orientation.  It&#039;s frequently mentioned that the schools he attends are saturated with genetic science or math geniuses.  The atmosphere is one where Jimmy&#039;s talents aren&#039;t valued, and he knows it.  He knows that his father, mother, and peers accept him as merely sub-standard.  This situation, combined with his desire to justify his own interests and be appreciated for them, is the main root for his perception that the practices of rational thought and artistic thought are at odds.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, once Crake enters Jimmy&#039;s life, the perceived dichotomy deepens to include more than just the two sides of academia.  Crake is the epitome of these math geniuses that make Jimmy&#039;s abilities fade into the background. Crake is characterized by his capacity for rational thought.  He is a remarkable student, who takes his capacity for logical reasoning beyond academia.  He applies it to social philosophy and uses it to dissect the meaning of human actions and their fundamental flaws.  Yet, this application of &quot;rational&quot; thought causes Jimmy to see another side of his own skills.  When hypothesizing about the new human race he would create, Crake addresses the issue of reproduction by effectively limiting romance to brief hormonal periods of fertility, claiming that the sexual frustration of humanity has caused more suffering than necessary.  Jimmy immediately picks up on this as an elimination of something very precious and unscientific: art.  Jimmy says &quot;[romantic frustration] has been an inspiration, or that&#039;s what they say.  Think of all the poetry--&quot; in an attempt to express the value of the &quot;free choice&quot; of romance. (166-7)  Yet, Crake, in his rational mindset, is unable to see art the way Jimmy does.  He responds to Jimmy&#039;s protests by saying, &quot;people can amuse themselves any way they like.  If they want to play with themselves in public, whack off over doodling, scribbling, and fiddling, it&#039;s fine with me.  Anyway it serves a biological purpose.&quot; (167)  He clearly cannot view art in terms of anything but scientifically verifiable value, and for that reason is very dismissive of art.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a trend throughout the entire story.  Jimmy&#039;s value are repeatedly marginalized.  Yet, the outcome cannot be ignored.  The outcome of supposedly perfectly rational thought is apparently apocalypse, and the replacement of humans with some hormonally driven human imitation.  Yet, in this new world, Jimmy is the only suvivor, and he does so through his connection to his extinct culture.  He repeats obscure words as mantras.  But more importantly, the result to Crake&#039;s scientific endeavor is a wholly unscientific people, who despite their programming, are developing mysticism around the legend of Crake and Oryx.  There seems to be a flaw in Crakes rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Doer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/322</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just thinking about the discussion of how Cayce does or doesn&#039;t fit the role of the female in science-fiction in respect to how things happen to her vs her happening to things.  I want to point out the fact that she transcends these categorizations in her professional life.  On one level, she very much makes the world revolve around her, as just a simple yes or no qualifies the value of a Logo into which a lot of time and money has been put.  However, it isn&#039;t quite her that does those things.  She frequently seems more like a vessel for her perceptive logo abilities than a wielder of them. For that reason, it&#039;s hard to categorize her into either stereotypical role of active agent or reactive agent.  Indeed, I think this also plays into the fact that a lot of of people have trouble gendering her while reading the book.  Maybe the fact that she doesn&#039;t fit into the stereotypical character roles also makes it harder for her to fit into the stereotypical gender roles.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Functionality</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/316</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A significant theme in William Gibson&#039;s &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is the functionality of dysfunction.  Cayce, as the protagonist, establishes this as an important subject.  She is cursed/blessed with strong reactions to corporate logos.  This sort of ability is frequently problematic for her.  Some logos are so offensive that they stimulate a physiological reaction in her.  Ultimately, her ability functioned like an allergy in her younger years.  When she first saw the Michelin Man in a magazine when she was a child, she puked.  And it still affects her that way.  When she &quot;finds a Michelin Man, it&#039;s white rolls executed in felt, garroted to the doorknob with a thick black cord.  Starts to scream but catches herself.&quot; (101)  Clearly there Cayce loses some amount of control because of her ability.  For instance, she frequently has to comfort herself with the mantra &quot;He took a duck in the face at two hundred and fifty knots.&quot; (101)  Really, her reactions seem a lot like psychosis, or some form of OCD.  However, the book presents the notion that these dysfunctions are really an asset.  Cayce&#039;s father starts the trend.  He was severely paranoid, but he saw his paranoia as a source of information.  He controlled his paranoia , and let it tell him things which ultimately helped him in his job.  Cayce then develops her father&#039;s train of thought further.  She believes that there is more information processing happening in the brain that what people are consciously aware of, and she believes that for her, the mammalian brain provides insights which are more than she could manage with just her consciousness. These violent reactions she has are actually the results of another process which she isn&#039;t entirely aware of, but which yields effective analysis of corporate logos.  And, amazingly, this analysis is apparently very valuable to corporations, and provides her with a career in which all she needs to do is give her impressions of logos.  Cayce&#039;s dysfunction is seen as a benefit to her in this book, because of how it is actually a very functional dysfunction.  It is a commodity to both her and the companies she freelances for.  This portrayal creates the impression that functionality takes precedence over most other things, including Cayce&#039;s own comfort.  It reveals that an oddity can be highly valued as long as it creates value.&lt;br /&gt;
	This, however, is contrasted by another theme in the book, which is the value of something that isn&#039;t functional.  This emerges most blatantly in the existence of the math grenades.  These are mechanical calculators, which, for their rarity and oddness, are extremely valuable.  They are effectively, completely obsolete, because of the advent of electronic computing, but they have value despite that.  The math grenades have value because they are historical a peculiarity, rather than anything functional.  This dynamic creates the impression that functionality and history are somehow at odds.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think this also relates to the issue of soul.  A philosophy which focuses on functionality seems like a cold &quot;soulless&quot; one, while one that embraces history seems more empathetic and &quot;soulful&quot;, because it is concerned about roots and origins.  It seems to me that this conflict between functionality and history is paralleled by some conflict in Cayce&#039;s mind about soul.  She repeatedly talks about how jetlag is the results of the soul being left behind, but when asked if she believes in the soul early in the book, she doesn&#039;t know.  It seems that she is struggling to understand whether existence is truly compassionate, or whether it&#039;s truly as lonely and cold and functional as it seems to be when she first arrives at London.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>little things</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/312</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to comment on the time-space things that bothered me in Midnight Robber.  I thought it was interesting how the two parallel worlds developed to be entirely the same, except in one, the humans colonized, and in the other, they didn&#039;t.  It implies to me that there is something about humans which makes them extra-temporal.  Somehow, everything but humans are constrained to carry out the same rolls in these two separate universes.  To me, it implies that there is a physical and tangible aspect to human free-will.  Does this work into the other theme of nanny granny taking playing with human free-will?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s with Antonio?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/290</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I take issue with Nalo Hopkinson&#039;s portrayal of love in Midnight robber.  In particular, I object to the way that the story of Antonio plays out.  I acknowledge that he was always a clearly flawed character, but I didn&#039;t see him as someone who was beyond saving in the beginning of the book.  In fact, I saw him as a uniquely empathetic character, in that he clearly loved his daughter.  He may have been a sinister mayor, with a desire to keep secrets from Nanny and the public, but in the beginning, it seems like he is not all selfishness.  When we first meet her, Antonio reveals his inner tenderness for Tan-Tan, &quot;his doux-doux darling girl, his one pureness.&quot; (13) He adores her so much that, &quot;he was forever going to watch at her sleeping in her bassinet.&quot; (13)  Clearly, there is something unique about Antonio&#039;s relationship with Tan-Tan.  The love he shows to Tan-Tan is possibly only paralleled by the love that Tan-Tan shows him in the beginning.  When I read this description of Antonio&#039;s adoration, I immediately categorized him as someone to root for.  My reasoning was as follows.  He loves Tan-Tan in what seems to be a purely selfless way, so he must care for more than just himself.  If he cares for one person more than himself, he must be capable of caring for others.  I had thought that his love for his daughter revealed that Antonio was a truly caring person.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially, when contrasted with Antonio&#039;s relationship with Ione, I thought Antonio&#039;s relationship with Tan-Tan would be a saving grace.  Before they had a baby together, Ione&#039;s and Antonio&#039;s lives were ruled by passion.  Their pursuit of &quot;love so sweet it hot&quot; led them to repeatedly cheat on each other. (45)  They apparently saw this dynamic, where they were constantly quarrelling over the each other&#039;s lovers, as a game, which somehow kept their sexual life interesting, and provide for passionate reunions.  To me, this sort of behavior seems completely hedonistic and self-serving.  Yet, once they have the Tan-Tan, Antonio seems to experience an almost tangible shift in priorities.  Ione continued with her series of other lovers, but the romantic turbulence doesn&#039;t seem like it was a prominent factor in their lives until we reach the where the story starts off.  I had thought this series of events indicated that the entrance of Tan-Tan into Antonio&#039;s life had redirected him away from an entirely selfish mode of functioning.  It seemed to me that Hopkinson portrayed passion as a destructive force, but that the entrance of Tan-Tan into the story stifled the cycle of passion by introducing love into the equation.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, all my notions about Antonio were steadily shattered.  It starts when it is revealed that he used poison in the machete battle.  From there, the situation deteriorates.  It becomes clear that Antonio is still the same self centered man, and Tan-Tan&#039;s attachment to him becomes painful.  He leaves her outside the bedroom while he and Ione fuck, right before he is sent to his holding cell. Clearly, his passion overwhelmed the love that we were seeing earlier in the book.  How could he want his last act as a citizen of Toissant to be to fuck his wife, rather than see his daughter?  It tore at me more than I would have expected.  From then on, desire, not love seems to be his driving motivation.  He took Tan-Tan with him half-way tree, seemingly out of desperation, rather than any care for her.  And ultimately, this desire goes completely out of control, and he rapes his daughter, expressing, what I once would have considered love, as pure primal passion.&lt;br /&gt;
To summarize, I see this chain of events as a way to befoul fatherly love.  I can&#039;t imagine how the feelings he felt for his daughter in the beginning could be conveyed as anything more sinister than any other father&#039;s feelings.  By the development, it seems to me that Nalo Hopkinson is saying that this love really is rooted in passion, and therefore that love is truly as destructive as passion.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Metavirus?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/282</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book, because, in large part, everything had a perfect degree of ludicrousness.  Everything was so foreign, and so unexpected, yet, Neil Stephenson was able to make it believable, by basing the ideas in historic, scientific, sociological, or linguistic fact.  However, this consistency made the advent of the metavirus very strange to me.  He mentions briefly that the bitmap which is presented to the hackers and fries their brains was received from space.  Somehow rife picked it up on radiowaves, but I don&#039;t get how that is even remotely sensible.  Can anyone provide me with any info which sets that notion up in the book: previous passages, scientific theories, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Associations</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/270</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Power plays a very significant role in Snow Crash.  With the fall of government, life has become radically unstable, with radically different expectations in terms of justice.  Individual security no longer holds the significance that we are used to.  The only way for an individual to ensure that violations of personal interests won&#039;t go unpunished is to tie those interests with the interests of a group, which means, in effect, to become a part of a franchise.  This truth is expressed repeatedly in the book by both Y.T. and Hiro and the way they manage their individualism.  The book first hints at this fact when discussing Hiro&#039;s employment choices.  Hiro prefers to remain a freelance hacker, but  apparently &quot;now, that&#039;s no longer possible, [because] software comes out of factories, and hackers are [] assembly-line workers.&quot; (39)  While the primary purpose of this passage is to describe the majority of the hacking profession, it clearly implies that there is no place for individual work, because organizations out-compete individual hackers.  However, Y.T. provides the best example of how association with a group is a form of protection.  When she&#039;s kidnapped, her connection to the RadiKS company allows her to escape.  Her membership in that group grants her the protection of that group, and ultimately, she&#039;s able to rouse a minor trasher army to take down the helicopter that she&#039;s in.  This sort of street justice only protects those that are associated, and it seems that the more powerful your associates are, the better your protection will be.  However, this protection has limits.  When Y.T. is apprehended by Metacops after delivering Hiro&#039;s pizza, she reminds them that &quot;I work for RadiKS.  We protect our own,&quot; but the cops respond &quot;Not tonight you don&#039;t.  Tonight you took a pizza from a scene of a car wreck.  Left the scene of an accident.  RadiKS tell you to deliver that pizza?&quot; (52)  She doesn&#039;t dispute this, because she realizes that RadiKS won&#039;t protect her if she strays outside their &#039;jurisdiction&#039;.  This reveals that, while the associations which people attach themselves to do provide some safety for the individual, but individual justice is nonexistent, since these franchulates/companies/sovereign nations are really only concerned with the integrity of the group as a whole.  Ultimately, this dynamic shows that the individual is only granted power through connections to other people, and adherence to the norms those people have agreed upon.  At least, this is what the system seems to be in the beginning of the book.&lt;br /&gt;
	As the book progresses, the power of the individual becomes more and more pronounced.  Raven seems like one of the primary catalysts for this change in perspective.  Raven, as an Aleut, is already predisposed to reject any association with any group.  His family and tribe history isolates him from anyone else, because his tribe had been isolated and disregarded by the rest of the world, to the extent that their own government tested nuclear weapons on them.  The resulting compulsion to vendetta, and quest to nuke America bars him from integrating into this culture.  However, Raven does more than resist integration.  From the first time Raven appears, it seems like he transcends the standard.  Hiro notices Raven in the crowd outside the Black Sun initially, because he stands much taller than everyone else.  Though, Raven manages to stand out in more ways than just his height.  When he makes his appearance at the concert, he transcends local gang politics, all on his own.  While it is arguable that the rules don&#039;t apply to him, simply because he&#039;s the most dangerous mother with a glass knife, and he&#039;s got an H-Bomb rigged to his brain, it seems to me that his power comes from something less tangible.  His ability to ride the waves seems like his real source of power.  This applies physically to his ability to use waves to travel long distances in kayak, but it also applies more generally to see the forces that are naturally present, and hitch a ride, as he did with the Orthos.  This sort of ability to ride these waves shows that he is able to manipulate existent forces to make groups work for him, instead of him working for a group.  I think his introduction into the story opens up new modes of functioning, which Hiro and Y.T. explore.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Social Justice</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/225</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed today in class that the issue of excessive wealth hit some nerves on both the social justice and economist side of the thought spectrum.  Some people were offended by the notion that someone who works just as hard as an executive (or some other high earner) could be living in squalor while that single executive could have so much money that he doesn&#039;t know what to do with it.  Others seemed offended by the thought that people could hold that executive in contempt for earning so much money.  I just want to add my two cents.  I&#039;ve always wondered what compels someone who already has enough money to make it so that he&#039;ll never be want for anything ever again, to make more money.  For example, David Beckham went to L.A. for more money, but how is that going to improve his life?  Isn&#039;t the camaraderie of his own nation worth more to him personally than some article about the 12 wealthiest athletes or something?  Yet, I meet so many people who see it as completely natural for someone to make a decision like that.  All I can say is that there is something fundamentally flawed with the decisions people with lots of money make.  I don&#039;t know why it is.  I could guess that since they&#039;ve been successfully making decisions to increase their wealth all their life, that&#039;s the only kind of decision they know how to make, but that would be a gross generalization, and is rather simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Where the danger lies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/217</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After class yesterday, I realized that a lot of discomfort with Cyteen&#039;s universe comes from the fact that individuals&#039; futures, to some degree, seem to be determined by forces outside their power.  This outside force appears in the form of tape, genetic manipulation, and environmental manipulation, as with Ari.  However, despite this level of control, and despite the disturbing subservience of the azi, the technology of tape and genetic manipulation doesn&#039;t really scare me on principle.  What scares me in this is the culturally developed belief that behavior is deterministic.  It is this belief that presents a society which appears so sinister.  The tape is useful, and yields a more competent, but the mentality of control causes simply sad situations, such as Jane leaving, to turn into scary ones.  For Nelly, instead of letting the grief of loss reshape her personality, as would happen in our society, they find it necessary to reprogram her to handle the loss, because to do otherwise would be to lose a valuable asset.  What is really being done to Nelly isn&#039;t really healing at all.  It is merely reestablishing the control which the society has over her.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Planets in my mind</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/192</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects of Samuel Delany&#039;s &quot;Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand&quot; was the notion of proportion.  Certainly, the title is a powerful contributor to this theme.  Comparing stars, massive balls of matter whose energy and size are beyond the comprehension of the human mind, to the matter which causes the lining of pockets to be uncomfortable, conveys the basic disconnect in the perception of proportion in the book.  The descriptions continuously challenge the reader to conceptualize reality on a different scale than daily life promotes.&lt;br /&gt;
	This challenge comes primarily in the form of the perception of size.  The universe presented contains six thousand plus worlds where humans have settled, and the majority of those worlds contain on the order of hundreds of millions of people.  This alone stretches the ideas of the proportional significance of humanity.  As the world is today, it is difficult develop a notion of the whole of humanity.  While I can understand the world as it is in terms of nations and social classes and environmental surroundings, any sort of categorization applied to such diversity over hundreds of light-years seems like it would break down in my mind.  Yet, humanity has apparently adapted to the change in scale of the medium across which it operates.  For example, Vondramach is a historical figure which shows the new potential for a megalomaniac.  Her influence was on a completely different scale than what people are familiar with today.  She controlled multiple planets, and somehow managed to gain notoriety throughout all of humanity, years and years after her death, as dispersed as it was.  The magnitude of that kind of personality is incomprehensible.  How can a single person have such a large effect on a system which I can barely comprehend?&lt;br /&gt;
	This difficulty with size also appears in the discussions of cultural fugue.  This disease/cultural state, is described early in the book as the series of events which leads to the elimination of all life on planet.  When we first see Marq, he is performing his duties as an industrial diplomat on a planet inhabited by a strange gooey people, they ask him whether their planet is at risk for the cultural fugue, as if it is some natural disaster, with cause beyond their control.  They seem like they are no more able to control it than we are able to control global warming.  Yet, their fear doesn&#039;t seem to be based on a scientific correlation, but on some pre-established notion of how planetary life-cycle.  I believe this is also a reflection of the different proportion of perspective in this new universe.  Rather than analyze the problems of any individual world within it&#039;s own context, worlds are diagnosed the way the human body is.  All six thousand provide a larger context such that an individuals planet&#039;s problems no longer have the same significance, and can be compared qualitatively to the problems of others.  This leader asking whether her planet will experience the cultural fugue is like someone with poison oak and a cold asking the doctor whether she&#039;s got the bubonic plague.&lt;br /&gt;
	Truly, I think that the issue of the cultural fugue is the most disorienting aspect of the story.  Aside from the popular treatment of the issue, the destruction of all life on a planet is something incomprehensible, even to the characters of the story.  This issue is represented in the issue of survivors.  Marq latches on to the idea that there MUST be survivors of the scorched planet Rhyonon, but encounters difficulty in conceptualizing what that means.  Japril challenges him to think about what a survivor means in the context of an entire planet, saying, &quot;When a world is destroyed â€“a whole world, Marq--there are so many fuzzy edged phenomena,&quot; (149).  A planet is so large, and has such extensive influence, that to give the disaster any defined borders is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cultural Fugue</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/188</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m having some trouble understanding a lot of this book.  One problem is I don&#039;t really know what the Cultural Fugue is.  Is it some sort of disease.  Is it access to a certain type of weapon?  My most educated guess, at this point, is that it is condition of society, like revolution, which ultimately leads to the destruction of all life on a planet.  However, I don&#039;t really know what the condition involves.  If anyone could point out certain passages for me, with regard to the Fugue, I would be very grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>something funny</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/171</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just realized why Octavia Butler wrote Imago in the first person.  It is ridiculously hard to write a compelling sentence about Jodahs, when you constantly have to refer to it as &quot;it&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>whoah!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/168</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just finished the book, and I&#039;ve just got to voice my first emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE HELL??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the weirdest thing I&#039;ve committed to reading.  EVER!  The whole book the roll of the ooloi wasn&#039;t portrayed ambiguously.  You never quite blamed people for acquiescing to their wishes, because it was never exactly clear that the ooloi were truly manipulating their emotions beyond the human&#039;s control.  Yet, in the last 50 pages of the book it becomes painfully clear that the role of ooloi is to change the behavior of partner species in a trade.  There is constant reference to how the ooloi scent pacified the humans, and only minor rationalizations that the scent opened human minds to truth.  But, then what happens?  They start a new colony, and people are apparently excited about it, because of the advent of construct ooloi.  What does this mean?  Does this mean that the Oankali have won?  Have they effectively domesticated humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>yay Akin</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/156</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler&#039;s &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, among other things, is an extremely thorough exploration of morality.  Firstly, it challenges the emotional connection to morality by creating a situation where standard sympathy for characters doesn&#039;t necessarily reflect who has the moral high-ground.  A lot of books use sympathy for the characters to give an impression of the moral situation.  However, in this book, it&#039;s nearly impossible to determine whether events are ethical, because the characters that those events affect are both human and alien.  For the humans, my sympathy center works fine, but the Oankali are presented as such a truly alien species that it seems nearly impossible to understand the reasons behind their actions.  Though the book attempts to give some insight into the machinations of the Oankali mind, especially in &quot;DAWN&quot;, it&#039;s very hard to pin down exactly how they think.  For that reason, the same reason I don&#039;t judge a crocodile for attacking a person, I find it difficult to judge the Oankali, and find it difficult to sympathize for them.  Any sympathy analysis of the situation yields a bias towards the humans that may not necessarily be fair.  The notion of a people who are motivated by the incorporation of new genetic material into their society is so completely foreign that my ethical sense becomes irrelevant, and I can only analyze the inter-species conflict intellectually.  This presents a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
How does one analyze intellectually an emotionally based subject like ethics?  This question has strange relevance to the world that has been presented in &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, because it derives ideas from both human and Oankali thought.  For the humans in the story, moral right is a very subjective and emotional issue.  It&#039;s clear that the decisions and moral convictions that humans make are based on their emotional state, which frequently includes fear and resentment.  These lead to convictions, which demonize the Oankali, and lead the more radical elements of Phoenix to believe that cosmetic surgery on construct children is a moral imperative.  On the other hand, the Oankali see morality very scientifically.  They have incredible insight into the genetic foundations of life, and for that reason they are able to analyze the core of different organisms&#039; actions on their most basic level.  When analyzing the human genome, the Oankali see a conflict between the hierarchical nature and intelligent nature of human beings, which they believe to be a fatal flaw.  Because the Oankali perceive organisms to be merely the sum of their parts, this flaw seems inescapable to them.  Since their society is morally motivated by genetic diversity, they see modifying the human race, and effectively eliminating the flawed genes, as the obvious ethical solution.  Letting the human race continue to propagate in its current state seems would be a crime.  When Akin is asked why the Oankali wouldn&#039;t help humans settle on Mars, he explains that, &quot;The only thing that would be more terrible would be to murder you all with my own hands.&quot; (502)  He goes further to explain the Oankali position, saying that &quot;You can&#039;t see and read genetic structure the way they do.  It isn&#039;t like reading words on a page.  They feel it and know it.&quot; (502)  The Oankali moral positions are driven by analysis of a perception which is near scientific.  The fact Oankali, which are all provided with similar information, come to a consensus on this moral issue shows that their moral reasoning is deterministic, and not subjective.  This divergence in ethical reasoning between humans and Oankali turns the earlier question to something different: how does use Oankali reasoning to analyze human ethics?&lt;br /&gt;
I believe the character Akin was made for the purpose of making the aforementioned question answerable.  He gives the most exposure to the Oankali type of thought, but at the same time, he is the most human of the constructs.  This gives him a perspective, which allows him to use his Oankali reasoning, but also address the emotions which are important to human moral reasoning.  Ultimately, he comes to the conclusion that there is a lack of symmetry between the two species, and that humans deserve an independent equivalent to the Oankali Akjai.  He realizes that the nature of Oankali necessitates symbiosis with other species, but he also is very aware of the injustice of forcing the human race into extinction in the process.  Ultimately, he shows that moral justice between two societies necessitates balance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Winter and Gender</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/148</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there is a divergence in opinion in our last class about the roll of gender vs environment in the qualities of the planet winter.  I just wanted to give a little bit of input about that subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that, while the harsh climate of this other world does have a significant effect on the people, the book uses the lack of gender as more of a differentiator.  For example, a lot of people seem to think that the difficult living conditions are what prevents war.  However, I believe that this condition would cause the exact opposite effect.  Limited resources have been at the root of most wars.  Where are resources more limited than on an ice-planet?  Instead, I believe the lack of fullblown war is a commentary on the male element in our societies.  This may sound like a cliched perspective, but I think that it is an interesting thought experiment, regardless.  As a male, I&#039;m fully aware of the compulsive emotions for self-sacrificing courageous deeds and posturing aggression.  These emotions are mostly irrational, but from just looking at the current state of political affairs, it is clear how significant they are in the public mind.  However, on winter, as there are no gender roles, half of the population isn&#039;t biologically programmed to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the tribe and their children.  Without this irrational undercurrent in society, war is never possible, because no one is willing to commit themselves to anything more that a &quot;foray&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Do You Think it is possible?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/111</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I read anything which portrays a world in which there has been a severe decline in standards, I think to myself, &quot;is this possible.&quot;  Atwood&#039;s tale is compelling and thoughtful in its own conditions, but I wonder if those conditions are reasonable.  I wonder if it is really possible to take so much away from most people, and still maintain order.  Part of gives me confidence in my future my perception that most americans espouse the notion of justice and freedom, and that any serious violation wouldn&#039;t be tolerated.  But, events since 2001 have challenged that perception.  There is clearly a much greater willingness to sacrifice these ideals when presented with a minor threat like terrorism than I thought.  This makes me wonder, what would the american people be willing to sacrifice if presented with a much realer threat?  Would they be willing to sacrifice equality?  Would they be willing to sacrifice their freedom to choose their own future?  How strong is the desire for survival?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>gambling</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/90</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To me, Atwood&#039;s &quot;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot; is, in large part, a cautionary tale about the dangers of apathy.  It is difficult to see the Republic of Gilead as anything but a totalitarian regime, with only the interests of the very few at heart.  Women are entirely subservient to men.  The men they service are limited to the aging and supposedly infertile commanders, leaving the majority of men with very little contact with women.  Basically, the majority of the population is disenfranchised.  However, despite the obvious lack of satisfaction there is little resistance against the system, further aggravating the situation.  It isn&#039;t until the end of the book that a sliver of hope for change appears.&lt;br /&gt;
	While the lack of resistance from men is more understandable than for women, because they aren&#039;t subjugated in the same way, the extent of male apathy in the text seems almost ludicrous.  Why would young men tolerate nearly no contact with women?  One would think their sexual drive alone would be enough to convince them that this is no way to run a country.  They don&#039;t benefit from female subservience, and are unlikely to ever do so, so what else compels them to support the system?&lt;br /&gt;
It seems to me that the system that Atwood proposed is paralleled by the culture of selling hard drugs.  In reality, one doesn&#039;t make much as a crack dealer, and the dangers involved are huge.  Getting caught by the police has significant consequences, and there&#039;s always the possibility that a disgruntled customer will try to get all of what you&#039;ve got without paying for it.  In reality, most dealers could get a better paying job at Burger King.  However, as you move up the status ladder, to relationships closer to the distributor, the quality of life improves drastically, with a radically higher income and much more safety.  Yet, the likelihood of going from dealer to a more luxurious job is extremely low.  This system, which presents the faint possibility of a great reward, keeps many thousands of dealers selling in very poor conditions in the same way that a slot machine keeps a gambler occupied for hours.  The same kind of mentality seems to keep the men of Gilead in check.  When Kate passes guards, she imagines &quot;They think [] of doing their duty and a promotion to the Angels, and of being allowed possibly to marry, and then, if they are able to gain enough power and live to be old enough, of being allotted a Handmaid of their own.&quot; (22)  The tantalizing thought of a handmaid of their own seems to be enough to focus the men on their duties.&lt;br /&gt;
Remarkably, the women of this culture seem to be in the inverse of the male situation.  All their rights are deprived, and they have been put into a hierarchy where even the most privileged woman, the wife, is limited to domestic issues.  Despite this, these women are unwilling to break norms, or resist the system, because they don&#039;t want to appear disloyal.  When asked by the Japanese tourists if she&#039;s happy, Kate responds that she is, rationalizing &quot;what else can I say?&quot; (28)  While the response can be seen as reasonable in this situation, it reveals a system of thought which is complacent.  Of course she can say other things.  She merely sees the consequences of rebelling, even a little, as unacceptable.  The fact that she is mentally unwilling to face the consequences of an unjust regime shows that the regime is in complete control over her.  This seems to be the trend for almost all the women in Gilead.  The consequences of disobeying are to lose priority status in the society, and risk becoming an &quot;Unwoman&quot;.  It is specifically because the gamble has so much at stake that women are so hesitant to resist.&lt;br /&gt;
For both women and men, it seems that self interest has inhibited the resistance which would benefit both sexes.  Clearly, their care for their individual future outweighs the power of any sort of moral conviction.  While there are a few counterexamples, it seems to me that this book is pointing out how risk operates on the different sexes if they are allowed to diverge, the developments from that divergence produce apathy which causes seemingly intractable social stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wintermute vs Zion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/66</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer portrays a world in which there is trend towards the perfection of function.   This is an ambiguous term, but I will try to make its meaning more explicit through context.  While the book displays the characteristic diversity of culture, which is characteristic of cyberpunk, there are a few essential universals, which make this trend obvious.  The matrix is the most prominent universal, as it is present almost all the through the story.  Case nearly always has access to the matrix.  Regardless of his location, his job is still the same, and he is still just as effective at it.  Another universal is the specialization of human function.  The most blatant example of this is the extensive mention of biological upgrades available to people, from beautification to mechanical implants and neurosurgery.  However, this idea also applies to the Tessier-Ashpool system of cycling cloned generations to maintain government.  All of these are divergences from normal human activity, and they reveal the perception that the normal range of human ability is not enough to be competitive in the future&#039;s highly diversified society.  Basically, it puts an emphasis on the ability to be modified, and no longer sees an individual as being confined by the nature of his or her nature physical endowments.  The matrix is the apex of this freedom from physical restriction, for the reason that it is completely non-physical.  This freedom from restriction allows for more effective pursuit for perfection of function.  Molly can be the perfect samurai, Case can be the perfect safe-cracker, and Wintermute/Neuromancer can be the perfect intelligence.  On some level, the trends in mainstream society are towards a matrix world, where all limitations can be hacked.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, this analysis of the Neuromancer world leads to assumptions about the value of mind vs. body.  If a society&#039;s goal is to create the most competitive individuals, then the body can be seen as merely an impediment.  Yet, since this cyberpunk universe is so diverse, it presents society which doesn&#039;t embrace the pursuit of perfection.  The space Zionists are a vivid contrast to the culture in Night City, The Sprawl, Istanbul, or Freeside.  Case&#039;s first impression of Zion was that it &quot;smelled of cooked vegetables, humanity, and ganja.&quot; (104)  This initial description of Zion creates the impression that Zion lies on the opposite side of the technological spectrum, and that it is  a more physical culture by nature.  This impression is further strengthened by the interaction with Zionites.  Case notices that &quot;Zionites always touched you when they were talking, hands on your shoulder,&quot; which he doesn&#039;t like. (106)  Similarly, when case shows Aerol the matrix, something Case is very intimate with, it makes Aerol very uncomfortable.  Clearly, this interaction serves to show how physicality is much more important for the Zionites, and the matrix, mind without body, disturbs them.  The contrast of the Zionite space colony is further emphasized by analyzing assuming that they share similar beliefs with contemporary Rastafarianism.  The religion believes that the body is sacred, and if you lose a part of it, you lose a part of your soul.  This creates a foundation for which we can imagine the Zionites reject the kind of physical augmentation that Molly has.  However, this contrast doesn&#039;t readily indicate whether the physical world or the mental world is more important.  Rather, the existence of both can be seen as a validation of both.  The fact that Zion exists in it&#039;s own sphere of influence in the book gives the Zionite philosophy merit.  Perhaps, the absolute physicality of Zion is put into the juxtaposition with its converse, wintermute/neuromancer, in order to make that point that in the diversity of the future, all types of existence have their merit.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Things that bug me</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/31</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found Starship Troopers to be a very disturbing read.  The story effectively chronicles Rico&#039;s assimilation into the Mobile Infantry.  It&#039;s a story of personal development, however, for such a story to be compelling, the protagonist needs to be a character for which the reader can have some pathos.  For someone like me, who doesn&#039;t believe in the necessity for a powerful military, relating to someone who chose to fight might be difficult.  However, Starship Troopers manages a wider appeal by presenting social context for the protagonist&#039;s actions.  Heinlein creates a universe where a human society has advanced significantly, to the point where war within the species is unheard of, but is founded on very different principles, which are very alien to me.  This makes character Rico much more sympathetic, because it allows him to have relatable priorities, such as racial equality, civil order, personal freedom, etc.  The only difference is that his ideology, which promotes these ideals, also leads to the notion that military is an integral part of a functional society.  What I found so disturbing in this book was that this ideology, which was contrary to many of my beliefs in a lot of ways, was very self-consistent, and logical in its formulation.&lt;br /&gt;
	The philosophy of people in the world of Starship Troopers is that force is a necessary part of maintaining order, and that order, aside from being a benefit in itself, yields prosperity.  On the simplest level, humanity embraces the use of force on a personal level.  Not only is the use of a spanking paddle common in homes and in school for the purpose of behavioral modification, but also, laws are enforced by public whippings.  I describe this as &quot;behavioral modification&quot;, because it is apparent that the society&#039;s notion of how to maintain order stems from the basic principles in potty-training a puppy.  In Professor Dubois&#039; lecture about the failures of the total democracies (our society), he asks Rico about how to train a puppy not to pee in the house, and Rico responds automatically that, &quot;You scold him so that he knows he&#039;s in trouble, you rub his nose in it so that he will know what trouble you mean, you paddle him so that he darn well won&#039;t do it again.&quot; (114)  Clearly, Rico is conditioned to think that physical force is necessary for changing an individual&#039;s undesirable behavior.  However, the idea of behavioral modification through force extends past the notion of the individual to modifying the behavior of a collective.  In a separate lecture by Professor Dubois,  a student presents the idea that violence solves nothing, but he retorts that &quot;Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor,&quot; citing the fact that an entire civilization&#039;s fate was determined when Roman armies destroyed Carthage. (26)  From this, the primacy of the military and Mobil Infantry becomes apparent.  According to the accepted thinking in this book, to maintain order, it is sometimes necessary to modify the behavior groups of people, or foreign nations, which disrupt order.  The optimal way to do this is to use controlled force, in order to compel a change in behavior.  Effectively, a paddle is to a pup as the Mobil Infantry is to uncooperative nations.&lt;br /&gt;
	The view that physical force is such an important part of civil society isn&#039;t a disturbing notion in itself, as cultures have espoused it before.  What is most unsettling is the justification is so well conceived.  A large part of the argument stems from the acknowledgement that humans, as well as most species, have evolved with an instinct for survival.  Any threat to survival should compel that species to adapt its behavior to limit that threat.  The philosophy of the future is that any good citizen is motivated by the same thing that a heinous criminal is.  Professor Dubois describes morality as &quot;an elaboration of the instinct to survive.&quot; (118)  What he means by this, is that moral code, and other socially beneficial qualities, aren&#039;t an inherent quality of man, but have been instilled in him by the society by appealing to his desire so survive.  Unlike, today, in the future, morality is seen as a scientifically justifiable construct.&lt;br /&gt;
	As a believer in evolution and science, these arguments are almost convincing.  However, the book reveals a weakness in this view of an effective society.  It claims that running a society is a matter of scientific analysis and proof, however, science requires evidence.  When Rico is taking History and Moral Philosophy as a cadet, the professor asks why the system of veterans voting is most effective, stumping his students.  He admits that &quot;the reason for continuing [this] system is the same as the practical reason for continuing anything: It works satisfactorily.&quot; (181)  However, this applies to more than just voting.  It applies to the entire system of government in this futuristic world.  The book claims that this method is most effective by science of empirical evidence, however, as a reader, I have no real evidence that such a system should work, and for that reason, I am no longer presented with a moral dilemma. â˜º&lt;/p&gt;
