 <title>Gender Inequality in Oryx and Crake.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/339</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our brief discussion of how Snowman is a corrupting influence on the Crakers started me thinking about how Snowman teaches human principles of ranking. He introduces the concept that men and women should behave differently, picking the men to lead the trek and surround and protect the women and children. Biological sex differences may lead to men and women taking different roles, but Snowman assigns these roles of different value without explaining why, simply citing it as &quot;the proper way&quot; (350). The &quot;women and children&quot; are grouped together without question, and the narration implies that they *clearly* need protection, which is only available from the men. I don&#039;t know how a non-monogamous society would raise its young (I wonder if there are any non-extinct animals that work like that?), but it seems like it might break down existing gender roles, not re-enforce them more strictly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of comparison, consider the treatment of race. &quot;[R]acism â€“ or, as they referred to it in Paradice, pseudospeciation â€“ had been eliminated in the model group, merely by switching the bonding mechanism: the Paradice people simply did not register skin colour. Hierarchy could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes that would have created it&quot; (305). The Crakers are, in fact, color-blind when it comes to race. Unless the scientists were to completely make-over the reproductive process (a lÃ¡ Butler), gender differences will remain. So, can you have differences without an attached system of ranking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the words of sociologist Robert W. Fuller in his novel on &quot;rankism,&quot; a blanket term for all cases of abuse within a system of power differences (e.g. racism, sexism, classism, etc.): &quot;It is crucial to get one thing straight from the start: power differences, in themselves, are not the culprit. To bemoan power differences is like bemoaning the fact that the sun is brighter than the moon. And rank differences merely reflect power differences, so rank differences are not the problem either, any more than color or gender differences are used as an excuse to abuse, humiliate, exploit, and subjugate. So it is with power and rank&quot; (&quot;Somebodies and Nobodies&quot;, 4). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the conceptual idea for the Crakers is similar. The idea was that they would be so perfectly engineered that &quot;hierarchy could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes that would have created it&quot; (305). I just don&#039;t quite understand how this could be possible. They were supposedly so perfectly engineered for their environment that they wouldn&#039;t need to make weapons, but they seemed pretty helpless without Snowman&#039;s gun. I think the context of real life outside of a predator-less biodome really calls these engineered assumptions into question, and that includes the existence of gender roles and sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m taking my second pass on Gibson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, how awesome is watching Battlestar Galactica for class? I&#039;m definitely not going to make it through four seasons, but I&#039;m pretty hooked...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Duality in Midnight Robber</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/306</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the existence of two parallel universes in MR, it&#039;s an enticing idea to contrast the two â€“ each as offering its own different form of oppression, for example. Toussaint, while a diverse, safe (thanks to Granny Nanny), and relatively utopian-like civilization, gives up privacy to the point that one &quot;couldn&#039;t even take a piss without the toilet analyzing the chemical composition of the urine and logging the data in the health records&quot; (10). New Half-Way Tree, in contrast, offers a return to nature where freedom comes with the trade-off of facing myriad wild beasts with less technology at one&#039;s disposal. Opportunities for dualistic analysis appear easy and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, MR follows a generally cyclical pattern that crosses boundaries freely between the two worlds, particularly in relation to the Robber Queen myth and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw-away myths such as that seen in &quot;How Tan-Tan Learn to Thief&quot; link together the characters in ways that inform the reader (consider the foreshadowing of Tan-Tan marrying Antonio or how Tan-Tan forcing her neglectful mother to become her maid reveals hidden resentment) but take place outside of the main narrative. Yet in the cylical interconnectedness of MR, myths of the &quot;Robber Queen&quot; play a large part in Tan-Tan&#039;s childhood â€“ at one point she refuses to change out of a Robber Queen costume for two days straight (30). Faced with abuse by her father, Tan-Tan transforms into the myth herself to be free: &quot;It must have been the Robber Queen who pulled out the knife. Antonio raised up to shove into the person on the bed again. It must have been the Robber Queen, the oulaw woman, who quick like a snake got the knife braced at her breastbone just as Antonio slammed his heavy body right onto the blade&quot; (168). Tan-Tan becomes the myth whose stories shaped her childhood. All of this takes place within the broader context of a cultural tradition of heroes &quot;escaping the horrors of slavery and making their way into brigandry as a way of surviving in the new and terrible white devils&#039; land in which they&#039;d found themselves&quot; (57). Stories from 17th century Afro-Carribean myth, Touissant &#039;real life&#039;, Touissant myth, New Half-Way Tree &#039;real life&#039;, and New Half-Way Tree myth blur into one another, sharing stories, characters, and motifs (e.g. wisdom trumps physicality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Hopkinson&#039;s unique ways of storytelling blend these &#039;separate halves&#039; together. The dialect remains constant throughout, and numerous changes in style (between the boldfaced nanny-narrator, 3rd person, boldfaced douen-speech) blur together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find parallels between this novel&#039;s celebration of a traditionally oppressed culture and the revolutionary picture of gender in Le Guin&#039;s The Left Hand of Darkness. As both break free from restricing systems of oppression, both create worlds in which &quot;the whole tendency to dualism that pervades human thinking may be found to be lessened, or changed&quot; (94).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Eshu</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/287</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about how Hopkinson&#039;s dialect critiques the normal technology-centric language of science fiction books, and the name &quot;Eshu&quot; came to mind. Looking it up on Wikipedia reveals some cool things (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&quot; title=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a mythological character from &quot;Yoruba mythology and related New World traditions&quot; who protects travelers -- definitely makes sense as a choice of terminology for a &#039;smart house&#039; that can help you out even when you&#039;re on the road. At the same time, Eshu was all about teaching people lessons, so maybe it makes sense that human nature (wanting to have privacy to do more-sneaky things) forces Antonio to try and get away from Eshu&#039;s all-knowing/all-seeing watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douen comes from Afro-Carribean mythology, too (Yoruba = west Africa), as part of Trinidadian mythology they were the forest-dwelling spirits of lost (unbaptized?) children (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caribbeantales.ca/ct_newsletter/archives/your_story/1/the_douen/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>2 effects of capitalism gone wild</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/272</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to follow-up on the idea presented in-class that Snow Crash takes a similar stance on both prejudice and democratic government. Eventually both will be pushed out of existence as capitalist competitivism acts as the ultimate driving force for all socio-cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the messages about prejudice found in the novel. Japanese (to use Snow Crash&#039;s terminology, &quot;Nipponese&quot; from here on out) businessmen rule economically, despite whatever prejudice may have existed in the past. The New South Africans have their own franchise with every right to create whatever racist rules they want (82), but they only exist because they had some economic value (and they prove quite easy to dispatch â€“ see pp. 301-302). As they cease to remain competitive, they will crumble in this world of no external support. Moreover, with more and more of life taking place in the metaverse, the idea of identity changes rapidly. In the &#039;verse, &quot;your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limits of your equipment&quot; (36). Race and gender become preferences that one can hide from an outside world. With an altered physics, overcrowding no longer becomes a physical problem â€“ there is no physical urban space to fight over as everyone can occupy any space and only the most advanced have created a means of physical combat. Combined with an inability to produce results within this ultra-capitalist world, prejudice becomes obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow Crash makes similar predictions about the future of the US democratic government. From the introduction of YT&#039;s mother it becomes clear that the government no longer functions in any way truly meaningful to the people it used to serve. With the CIA and Library of Congress corporatized, the government begins to sound just like another franchise: &quot;Feds don&#039;t make much money, but they have to work hard, to show their loyalty&quot; (101). With weekly polygraph tests and no obvious influence on the rest of the country (security is privatized and services, to the extent that they exist at all, are provided by each burbclave), the feds seemed to have turned on themselves to keep busy. The steadily increasing power big business stripped the government of any legitimate function. In this capitalist world, they quickly disappear into the fringes of society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dealing with Vulnerability</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/235</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to tie together two issues we discussed briefly in class: Lore&#039;s seemingly overwhelming worry about being discovered and themes of environmentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her life with Spanner, Lore constantly worries about being recognized from the kidnappers&#039; videos: &quot;There was nothing specific of which she was afraid, just... everything, as though the world were a gelatinous beast that would fall upon her and suffocate her. The open spaces, the feeling that her back was naked, that people could see through her clothes, that someone would recognize her as the heiress who was kidnapped three or four months ago&quot; (86). Paragraphs of paranoid thoughts often culminate with worries that &quot;people might recognize her, might stare and point&quot; (57). Such behavior is understandable -- with the kidnapping and broadcasting of the videos, she went from an icon of premier social standing to an object of pity. Images of her in a weakened, suffering state flooded the market. According to a worldview where &quot;To look vulnerable was to be vulnerable&quot; (89),  being recognized from the pictures left Lore susceptible to more than just blackmail, but true emotional harm. She had internalized the image of the online photos -- the threatened and abused character in the kidnappers&#039; films is who she is, and she&#039;s afraid of others reconizing her, and in that recognition, confirming that identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emphasize the danger and power of this cycle, Lore has the model of Stella: &quot;To be used like a receptacle, a commodity, and to know it, to be helpless before it, and then to see that helplessness reflected back at her every time her eyes met her abuser&#039;s across the table, every time she saw herself in the mirror&quot; (292)... faced with such a situation, Lore understands why Stella chose to kill herself. Lore accepts this choice, and must prevent herself from being overhwelmed by shame from which she can never escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow River introduces two competing methods of dealing with this vulnerability. The first is a type of &#039;eat or be eaten&#039; mentality that drives Lore to reflect &quot;Everyone suffered. It was just a question of making sure she was using them, and not the other way around&quot; (85). Lore justifies seruptitiously videotaping her friends having sex with the rationale that they&#039;ve seen her in similar situations (197). In her relationship with Spanner, Lore learns how to manipulate her way into power, which parallels the tactics used by Greta and Katerine -- all of them focus on using others in order to avoid the conclusion that they were used and harmed by others. The alternative seems to be ecological. As Lore begins to tend her garden, she shows a strong departure from the previous mindset: &quot;Many of the weeds she left alone. They had fought to be there; she wasn&#039;t going to be the one to pull them out. Besides, they were green and growing&quot; (87). This respect for life, growth, and individual freedom contrasts sharply to the &#039;everyone is suffering, take what you can&#039; idea from before. As Lore continues to explore this new way of living, she begins to feel better about herself: instead of illicit activities that make her lips begin to curl like Spanner&#039;s (i.e. getting trapped into a cycle of hurt-or-be-hurt), she begins to recognize a need for &quot;wild things, natural things&quot; (113).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in exploring more about the satisfaction Lore finds in this new approach, as well as the seeming contrast between the &#039;natural&#039; and &#039;kill-or-be-killed&#039; lifestyle (isn&#039;t that how the animal world works?), but I&#039;m going to call it a night for now.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sygn and Family</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/203</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What acts and thoughts in day-to-day life separate a member of the Family from the Sygn? To begin with, one must make an attempt at determining the particular values of each faction. Keeping in mind the potential bias of the Sygn-affiliated narrator, the Family centers around the &quot;father-mother-sonâ€¦basic family unit&quot; (119). At the same time, the narrator emphasizes that the particular family structure itself matters less than the accompanying power structure. For an example, she suggests, &quot;in the Family structure, the parents are seen to protect and enclose the children, to protect them from society&quot; (120). The Sygn paradigm contains a multitude of alternatives, including the Dyeth&#039;s stream structure, in which &quot;the children are the connection between the parents and society&quot; (120). Sygn culture is about diversity of belief and liberal acceptance of differences â€“ even the Sygn itself has no set symbol, spelling, or pronunciation (97). In contrast, the Family can be characterized by a lack of flexibility. Their children are a representation of their entire way of life â€“ both need protecting from the countless alien alternatives existing in this vast universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Chris West offers really interesting insight into these issues in his article, &quot;Perverting Science Fiction: Thinking the Alien Within the Genre.&quot; He suggests that a key differnence between the Sygn and Family can be found in that &quot;the dominant culture on [the Sygn] section of their world does not subscribe to compulsory monogamy, nor to compulsoty heterosexuality, nor does it turn its face from interspecies liaison&quot; (West 108). Why does the sexual take on such an important role? To Family members, Sygn sexual behavior fails to protect their family&#039;s identity. It would already appear easy enough to lose one&#039;s identity and history in this universe of seemingly limitless people and information; promiscuous sex (and the associated risk of children outside of the protective Oedipal family structure embrace), homosexual/interspecies sex (and the abandonment of persuing children) further the threat to the fundamental unit of the Family worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, how does the issue of identity function within Sygn culture? Clearly this issue is the primary driving force of all Family interactions, as the control of information and contempt for the above-mentioned sexual behavior both derive from the same culture-propagation instinct. But does this exist within the Sygn? The narrator often discusses her ancestors and the Dyeth history. Historical cultural knowledge seems to be prized and is made readily available through the Web. Historical figures, Vondramach in particular, create context in which the characters interact and provide insight into the issues faced (so that history won&#039;t repeat itself? E.g. Availability of the rings for Rat Korgaâ€¦). A Sygn point of view, while inclusionary and adaptive, does seem to preserve some sense of appreciation of the past. The difference remains centered around how the two worldviews imagine going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possibility of a mixed-race president and multiracial people as the fastest growing race in the country, I think the implications for contemporary American politics are huge. Instead of obsessively persuing a return to life &#039;the way it was,&#039; the Sygn encourage moving forward toward cross-racial and cross-cultural interaction while remaining grounded in an understanding of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>To oppose is to maintain, and blue eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/143</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The issues of duality, competition, war, and progress bring to mind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.love-shy.com/Gilmartin/Chapter03/elliot.html&quot;&gt;Jane Elliott &quot;blue eyes&quot; classroom study&lt;/a&gt;. That link is knowledgeable, but not the most approachable, so let me summarize. In order to teach a lesson on discrimination to a homogenous Iowa elementary school classroom, she began an experiment where she declared children with blue eyes &#039;better&#039; than the others. After a short speech about the weaknesses of brown eyed children, she continued with the day&#039;s lesson, taking every chance to confirm the blue eyes assumed superiority and call out brown eyes&#039; negative behavior as representative of their kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are wide (and the study has its critics, of course), but I wanted to focus on the measurable changes in performance that accompanied the experiment. By the end of that first school day, measurements of math, vocabulary, and reading proficiency all showed major change from where the students were one week before: the brown eyed students&#039; scores fell drastically (e.g. regressing from a 3rd to a 1st grade reading level) and the blue eyed scores rose dramatically (e.g. improving the a 5th grade reading level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interpretation I buy into states that this only happened because our children learn at an early age that there are better and worse groups of people in our world. Classification, competition, and discrimination are functions used by our society, because they have positive effects for the &#039;better&#039; group! So how do we break out of this system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turn to what Le Guin says in The Left Hand of Darkness: &quot;To oppose something is to maintain it. [One] must offer an alternative&quot; (153). A critique of the current system is pointless without proposing other options. From the very introduction of the book she describes the importance of &quot;the imagination&quot; (i). An alternative biology, interactions with other species, the general concept of a science fiction tale about the futureâ€¦ all of these are metaphors geared toward imagining different futures in order to change the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we&#039;ve already begun a good discussion on exactly what alternative Le Guin offers. In her world, &quot;There is no division of humanity into strong and weak halves, protective/protected, dominant/submissive, owner/chattel, active/passive (94). The total breakdown of the classify/compete/discriminate system does slow the society down in some ways â€“ Genly often describes the Gethenians as slightly slower, weaker, and less advanced (50, 103) â€“ but best achieves Le Guin&#039;s ultimate value of civilization (something like &#039;the open trade of ideas, techniques, material goods/technology, and culture&#039; based on pages 34-35, 103, and 137-138). Maybe &#039;achieves&#039; is the wrong word. I think Le Guin is offering this future with hope, painting it in a good light. However, the &#039;good&#039;/&#039;bad&#039; judgment here is definitely process-oriented, not result-oriented, as based on 50, 102, and 259.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. S. Final reason I love this book? Le Guin gets special relativity right. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;[edit: Never mind. I ran into someone who caught me up. I&#039;m keeping the post up here for the Le Guin link below]&lt;br /&gt;
I was down in San Diego during class today. Could someone give me a super-brief run-down of what we talked about? (e.g. The impact of Black=normal on racial/political relations in Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin&#039;s treatment of gender as ____, Soviet Union/USA metaphors, or whatever we ended up discussing). Thanks much!&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to focus in on this claim that the Handmaid&#039;s tale movie &#039;blunts&#039; the scariness of the book through three particular explorations: the protagonist&#039;s access to control and identity, the depiction of the handmaids&#039; indoctrination, and the protagonist&#039;s relationship with Nick. (This is in equal parts a response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92&quot; title=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92&quot;&gt;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/92&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91&quot; title=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91&quot;&gt;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recognized, the movie grants the protagonist major individuality when it reveals her name. This act of establishing identity continues throughout, though, often serving to blunt the scariness of the book. Simply through the visual nature of film the movie gives her a body type, a skin color, and an approximate age. Throughout her private meetings with the commander, this identity grows. In contrast to her belief that &quot;Whatever is silenced will clamor to be heard, though silently&quot; (p. 153), she yells and chats loudly (~54:00) and appears very relaxed with the commander. As discussed in class, Atwood closely links clothing and identity â€“ Moira escapes by donning the Aunt&#039;s garments, the red habit and wings play a huge part in defining the handmaids. In the film, Kate takes every chance she can to discard these clothes, wistfully leaning topless out the window after the first ceremony and often stripping to only her white slip when she returns to her room. Such actions contrast sharply to the novel&#039;s commentary on identity: &quot;My self is a thing I must now compose, as one composes a speech. What I must present is a made thing, not something born&quot; (p. 66). The freedom to dress as she pleases when alone (including being naked, returning to the way she was born), in addition to the exercise of more explicit control (helping Moira escape, killing the commander, as explored in the other posts) undermines the feeling of hopelessness the novel cultivated so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with dreamfall17 and wooohooo that the indoctrination scenes seem to give up their power somewhere, though I find the particulars difficult to pin down. I find the visuals of the Marthas with their high heels, conservative brown wool dresses (not very efficient for dealing with escaping prisonersâ€¦), megaphones, and small discipline sticks less than imposing. Most importantly, I feel that the film fails to demonstrate a &quot;breaking&quot; process in the handmaids. In a major way, this can&#039;t be helped, as the film must sacrifice the ability to get inside Offred/Kate&#039;s head and follow her increasingly compliant thoughts. But, forced outside the stream of consciousness, the movie speeds through the transition from women fighting back against the armed guards to agreeing passively with the Marthas. Finally, one of the main issues brought up by dreamfall17 makes a huge difference â€“ the movie&#039;s obsession with depicting the actual violence involved actually weakens the threat. A future dystopia built on violence and military force is much more easy to fight than one built on laziness and arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier writers also introduced the final point, but I wanted to try and flesh it out a little more. How might the protagonist&#039;s relationship with Nick differ in a way that decreases the threat of the novel? First, Luke is dead, completely eliminated from the picture. The lack of guilt that Offred is going through, then, decreases the tension with Nick. The movie continues to simplify their relationship when Nick takes on a seducing role instead of seeking to remain uninvolved (&quot;No romanceâ€¦ okay?&quot;). Throughout the film, nobody explicitly mentions the existence of the &quot;eyes.&quot; Without this worry that Nick might turn her in, his relationship becomes one of sexual satisfaction and salvation (sexually and from the entire system) without guilt or downside.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Names</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/73</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I began to think about the power of names early on when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/neuromancer.html&quot;&gt; the website I was using to define some of the most obscure vocabulary &lt;/a&gt; made the point that the name Case might derive from how his body is no more than a case for his mind, just like the physical housing of a computer has little to do with the actual content. I think this reading into his name has merit, though, as multiple blog entries already attest to, Case&#039;s relationship with his body is quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I next began to think about names in the context of computer science. From what I remember from my one semester of the class (THOSE WHO KNOW BETTER, PLEASE COMMENT AND CORRECT!), some of the most important proofs in computer science involve referring to programs by a &#039;name&#039; that&#039;s actually their entire content (written out in assembly language, the string of 1s and 0s). Knowing the assembly language string of a program fully describes everything the program is and does (at least until programs develop some kind of consciousness and/or the issue of &#039;souls&#039; gets involved...). In this context, a true name carries a certain power over a program that we can perhaps extend to the AIs in Neuromancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the novel, Gibson makes it clear that names carry much importance with passages like &quot;To call up a demon you must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it is real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is to learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names the owners seek to control. True names...&quot; (243). The &#039;power of true names&#039; motif abounds from fantasy (in Le Guin&#039;s Earthsea trilogy, &#039;magic&#039; derives from knowing the true names of things) to the Bible (the ancient Hebrew or Greek etymology of different names is often hugely revealing). I like the idea of connecting the ascribed importance of &#039;true names&#039; to the origination of language itself (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name&quot;&gt; wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So (and I hope we can get into this tomorrow), what might be some of the meaning behind some of the names in the book?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Truth, science and religion in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/39</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m a bit science and religion obsessed academically, but I think the discussion here could be fruitful. This really goes back to the class discussion about the &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals&quot; (p. 118). I think Riceguy20 is totally right to highlight  the quote &quot;Man has no moral instinct&quot; (p. 117) as really important -- through the instrument of Mr. Dubois, Heinlein constructs the ultimate &#039;science trumps religion&#039; universe. My interest derives also from Asimov&#039;s &quot;Foundation&quot;, in which a branch of mathematics called &quot;psychohistory&quot; develops that governs nearly every part of life (to certain scale/degree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present-day world, writers like Edward Wilson might suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
biological basis for morality&lt;/a&gt;, but even so we&#039;re still one step shy of explaining all subjects with symbolic logic. Repeatedly, such logic is the ultimate appeal in Starship Troopers. Assignments like &quot;Bring to class a written proof, in symbolic logic&quot; (p. 179) often follow many enormously important discussions in History and Moral Philosophy. This type of proof (or even just the suggestion that such a proof exists) seems to apparently putting the matter to rest; regardless of its controversial, political, and subjective nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this strike anyone else as a perversion of the humanities? Not everything  can be an &quot;exact science&quot; (p. 182) with one right answer. I cherish needing different models (yeah, there&#039;s some truth in looking at morals as deriving purely from nature and nurture; but I also find much meaning from considering some transcendental role), so it frustrates me that Starship Troopers describes a &#039;one right, proovable, answer&#039; world. Interestingly, your answers in such a universe are still going to depend on your initial assumptions... you can&#039;t prove everything. The biggest assumption made, that science works and teaches them Truth about the real world, can be neither proved or disproved, only debated and assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might science fiction like ST or Foundation disregard any need for non-scientific truth? Yes, the intended audience might be more familiar with science as authority, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s all there is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Might Makes Right in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/22</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To continue a discussion begun in class today, what is the function of violence in Starship Troopers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note:&lt;br /&gt;
-Suffrage was available only to those who completed their 2(+) years of voluntary service.&lt;br /&gt;
-Those who wish to serve a term of service can participate in non-overtly-violent ways (as terraformers, technicians, logistics, and human guinea pigs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is violence the only way to gain merit in this society?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, we only see through the narrator&#039;s perspective, who quickly learns that &quot;The Mobile Infantry is the Army. All the others are either button pushers or professors, along merely to hand us the saw; we do the dirty work&quot; (p. 39). His account of transformation throughout boot camp resounds with descriptions of physical labor; along the way characters settle a multitude of  power struggles with hand-to-hand combat (e.g. introduction of sergeant Zim, the showerroom scene with Ace). Juan earns real respect only after his first drop, and his father&#039;s love is only clear when his father risks his own life as a member of the MI. Again and again it&#039;s the willingness to engage in violence (interestingly, success doesn&#039;t seem to matter as much) that &#039;separates the men from the boys.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this story sticks close to its moral that a man earns respect by demonstrating &quot;through voluntary and difficult service that he places the welfare of the group ahead of personal advantage&quot; (p. 182).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hello!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/13</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to be up and running smoothly, sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in some type of &#039;science fiction inventory&#039; -- an assessment of what a particular person is drawing on when they talk about the genre as they know it. Personally, my mother often bragged about watching Star Wars with me while I was in the womb and we had a fair amount of Star Trek (both OS and TNG). As I grew up, mobs of Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figures lived (and did battle) side by side in a miniature plywood house we made. My brother and I saved our allowance money for X-Men and Star Wars cards, again often playing games or setting up scenes in which to role-play them duking it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the actual literary side of science fiction played a much smaller role in determining these interests. We had a lot of Fantasy books for bedtime stories (Redwall, anyone?) and I loved &quot;I, Robot&quot; and the Star Wars Rogue Squadron sort of stuff, but I think it&#039;s fair to say that by the time I was a serious reader at all, I dismissed most sci-fi as fluff (&quot;Ender&#039;s Game&quot; was the closest I got to rediscovering the genre, but even that felt like a guilty pleasure by the time I was reading it late in high school). At the same time, we watched Voyager every week as a family (shameful, I know) and it was definitely more from movies/video games that I really learned about &#039;science fiction.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found such books exciting (I thought about Le Guin&#039;s &quot;the ones who walk away from Omelas&quot; for years after reading it in 6th grade and I loved &quot;Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot; in high school), but didn&#039;t really read that much on my own. Maybe it was because I fell into the trap of not doing much reading for fun. Particularly because, when I did, it was the equivalent of educational baby-food -- Harry Potter and the like. In the reading of &quot;canonical&quot; fiction and other coursework, I somehow forgot that there could be *good* science fiction that was stimulating on more than a surface level (I just read &quot;Foundation&quot; finally over winter break and it was a major reason to want to take this course).&lt;/p&gt;
