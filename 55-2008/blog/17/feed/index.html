 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gawker, the king blog for sarcastic, jaded 20-somethings, adores Battlestar Galactica in a way I thought impossible for a bunch of bloggers so mired in their own ironic-ness.  Anyway, their recaps of its goings-on are hilarious, or at least I think they are hilarious.  If anyone is interested:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Religion is frustratingly necessary</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/358</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crake constructs a new genetically engineered human race to live more &quot;in harmony&quot; with the earth and each other by removing the human propensity for violence, meat-eating, religion, etc. etc.  Unfortunately, a lot of those are a more intrinsic to the human makeup than Crake originally guessed.  The Crakers are alone, in a world they can no  longer understand now that Crake has taken science away from them.  The only connection they have with the old world is Snowman, so naturally they go to him for answers.  Snowman becomes their guru, their demigod, who in turn raises Oryx and Crake to the status of gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake, through Snowman, provide a greater truth and reason for the Crakers than they can access with their own senses.  The three members of the old human race can answer questions for the new ones.  It is a natural, essential part of any conscious being, this need to find these answers.  I remember reading a Newsweek cover story when I was in high school â€“ which was apparently a long time ago, because I can&#039;t find the article anywhere on the Internet â€“ on the theory that the need for religion is hard-wired into our genes.  We can&#039;t help but want to believe in a greater power, though in the modern age that &quot;greater power&quot; can be science, as well as a god/dess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I suppose that the above claim is a hard one to prove, given that the only (proven) conscious beings we know about are us, and having a sample size of one is not a particularly accurate way of drawing conclusions.  However, a being that does not want to find answers to the unknowable world around it cannot possess curiosity, and a being without curiosity will not learn and will not have any new thoughts, and a being that does not think and learn can hardly be conscious.  So, as someone said in class yesterday, the only way Crake could have defeated the need for religion would have been to replace humans with a new race of monkeys.  So, conscious beings need answers. Since the Crakers do not have hard science to provide these answers for them, they have to start back where the ancients did â€“ with creation stories, fables, and myths, a primitive religion constructed around father and mother deities, Crake and Oryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, religion comes along with a whole bundle of less savory things, as history has proven time and time again.  The Crakers will become more passionate about their deities.  As the religion becomes more and more complex, discrepancies will arise (look at how simple the original difference between the Sunnis and the Shi&#039;ites was), which will lead to argument, which because of the passion behind it will lead to hate, which will lead to war, with which comes the need to construct a hierarchy (someone has to win, which means that a whole bunch of someones will be better than a whole bunch of other someones).  And, we&#039;re back where we started, basically, except now there are a whole bunch of little herbivores running around destroying each other, and the world with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy&#039;s life pre-apocalypse serves as a way to remind us of how difficult, how impossible, it is to live without some kind of higher power to look up to.  For a child, their parents are the end-all, be-all â€“ I know when I was a kid, at least, whatever my father said was absolute truth, and anyone who said otherwise could go suck it.  (I don&#039;t think I would have phrased it in exactly that way when I was seven, however.)  Jimmy&#039;s parents are too transparently flawed for Jimmy to be able to look up to them, to be comforted in the knowledge that they are looking out for him and protecting him always.  The accounts of his early childhood are saturated with pervasive feeling of loneliness, reminding the reader of how natural that need is, and how desolate it feels to be without it.  When the childlike Crakers ask Snowman for answers, therefore, it is all the more understandable for the reader.  It&#039;s nice to feel like there&#039;s some sort of reason and plan behind all this nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I hope that grace days count for the blog, too, because I totally used mine for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ahahaahaa last minute</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/338</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading, I noticed several self-referential comments woven into the narrative, remarks that seemed to comment back on Neuromancer and the academic work surrounding it.  Though apparently Gibson is less aware than I thought him to be â€“ how did he not notice that he had created another character with the name Case? â€“ my personal opinion is that reader interpretation is as important, if not more important, than authorial intent.  I think that what I found was interesting, even if it was not planted there by Gibson to be found.  Or, perhaps, I am just recognizing false patterns, in which case this becomes interesting on an entirely different level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the academic work that has been done on Neuromancer discusses the mind-body divide, and how it plays out in cyberpunk in general and Neuromancer in particular.  The concept that we have both a body and a consciousness separate from it â€“ the mind or the soul â€“ is a philosophical construction dating to ancient Greek.  In Western culture, particularly, the mind became more and more privileged over the body, culminating in Neuromancer&#039;s fantasy of total escape from the body and into cyberspace.  The body becomes &quot;the meat thing,&quot; something to be disdained entirely (Neuromancer 55).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pattern Recognition, Gibson begins with his own assessment of Neuromancer&#039;s style of science fiction: &quot;We have no idea, now, of who or what the inhabitants of our future might be.  In that sense, we have no future.  Not in the sense that our grandparents had a future, or  thought they did.  Fully imagined cultural futures were the luxury of another day, one in which the &#039;now&#039; was of some greater duration&quot; (Pattern 58-59).  Rather than fantasize about an alternate dimension of disembodied minds that may never be, Pattern Recognition demonstrates how that feeling of escape from the body can be enacted with the technology we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he clarifies that an actual escape of the mind from the body is neither possible nor desirable â€“ he grounds consciousness more securely in the organs of the body.  Again speaking through Bigend, Gibson writes, &quot;what we think of as &#039;mind&#039; is only a sort of jumped-up gland, piggybacking on our reptilian brainstem and the older, mammalian mind, but our culture tricks us into recognizing it as all of consciousness&quot; (Pattern 71).  After reading article after article about the mind-body gap in Neuromancer, this appeared to me to be a direct reply from Gibson to all the academics who had been discussing his book amongst themselves for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he includes a mention of Parkaboy &quot;railing on about Mama Anarchia&#039;s tendency to quote Baudrillard and other Frenchmen who annoy him so deeply&quot; (Pattern 50).  Baudrillard&#039;s work on &quot;hyperreality&quot; was mentioned often in the articles I read about the disembodied mind, and though I obviously cannot be sure who the other Frenchmen are, the &quot;father of modern philosophy,&quot; Rene Descartes, the man responsible for the modern formulation of the divide between mind and body, was French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many of the mentions Gibson makes in the beginning of the book seem critical of the concept of cyberspace, Cayce experiences the internet very much like Case experience the matrix.  Sure, she does not attach any electrodes to her head and go rushing around in receding city lights, but the internet provides her life with more meaning than the real world ever does.  The internet gives her the footage to obsess over, the catalyst for the sort of quest for truth that she embarks on, and Parkaboy, a better and truer match for her than anyone she could find in the real world by herself, as Boone Chu attests.  Though embodiment is not criticized in Pattern Recognition, as it is in Neuromancer, the mind is still the important bit of that partnership, capable of finding meaning in life much more profound on its own than fettered by the body.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>language in Pattern Recongition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/313</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;ve been reading Pattern Recognition, and I&#039;ve noticed that Gibson writes with what I perceive to be a British tone, with British vernacular - &quot;bin it&quot; rather than &quot;throw it away,&quot; &quot;come round&quot; instead of &quot;stop by&quot; or &quot;go over,&quot; casual use of the often-still-forbidden-in-America &quot;C-word&quot;, stuff like that.  However, he is apparently from Vancouver.  Is he affecting a British tone because it&#039;s set in London, or do Canadians speak/write more British than American?  It seems a really silly/trivial question, but it&#039;s been bothering me and I&#039;m supercurious now.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the red pill or blue pill?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/271</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, judging by the titles of the responses that have come before me, I have chosen a well-trodden path to talk about, but it&#039;s the only question that came up repeatedly for me as I was reading, so I&#039;m going to write about it anyway and hope that some kind of original thought manages to creep its way in somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a popular theme for science fiction writing and film: which to choose, grim reality or blissful illusion?  Somehow, the message is nearly always &quot;choose reality&quot; â€“ Snow Crash is the first text I&#039;ve come across (though I do not claim to have a comprehensive view) that is somewhat value-neutral on the subject.  I say &quot;somewhat&quot; because the two main characters advance such polar opposite viewpoints, both of which seem equally appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro is in control and has power in the Metaverse; he is a &quot;warrior prince&quot; in the Metaverse (63).  He is not totally sold on reality, either, saying &quot;when you live in a shithole, there&#039;s always the Metaverse&quot; (63).  Y.T. has a similar kind of control and power in reality; she is pretty much autonomous and is almost always in control of her body and her fate.  She has no qualms about entering into the Metaverse only as a black-and-white, something aficionados of the Metaverse cringe at, and criticizes Hiro at one point (though I cannot find the citation now, of course) for spending too much time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, a friend of mine posed this question to me: If you could have a spouse OR a Hobbes (of the Calvin and Hobbes variety), which would you choose?  It was supposed to be a light question to keep the conversation going, but the ensuing discussion went on for hours.  The advantages and disadvantages of having a spouse are pretty obvious, so I will pass over them for now.  Hobbes would be the perfect best friend â€“ you would have a complete and total understanding of one another, and you would be guaranteed to never meet anyone that could even rival Hobbes for fulfilling interaction and conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for everyone else, he&#039;s imaginary.  You cannot share him with anyone else, so you effectively have to choose between a perfect friendship with one person, and the rest of the world, which does not contain anyone who could be your friend in any real way (they will always pale in comparison to Hobbes).  Compare this to Hiro: does he choose the U-Stor-It or the Metaverse, a reality that he can manipulate and control, a reality more perfect than one he could realistically attain in the real Los Angeles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s answer is ambiguous, which is a bit of a cop-out, but does prove what a complex question it is.  Snow Crash seems not to be arguing for one kind of reality over another, but a balance of the two.  Hiro criticizes those who never totally leave the Metaverse, describing the gargoyles as &quot;the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporationâ€¦they serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them.  Nothing looks stupiderâ€¦[it] mark[s] the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society (123-124).  However â€“ lest readers think they have landed on a solution to the tension â€“ Hiro becomes a gargoyle later in the book, and that unquestionably saves his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Rich people suck.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/237</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Slow River.  However, I also enjoy The Hills and America&#039;s Next Top Model, so this means very little.  I enjoyed it, but I didn&#039;t think it was particularly good.  The major issue I had with it was the apparent lack of a character arc for Lore.  As she is the protagonist, I assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with her; at least, I found no indication to the contrary.  I did not particularly like her, however, and there were some major flaws in her character that I thought needed more of a treatment than the book gave.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the story (chronologically), Lore is:&lt;br /&gt;
 a) mind-blowingly rich, and has all the easy naÃ¯ve carelessness of the aristocracy&lt;br /&gt;
b) mildly obsessed with sex&lt;br /&gt;
c) prideful and striving to prove herself to those around her (her family, the company)&lt;br /&gt;
d) unthinkingly supportive of the unfair and dangerous monopoly her family hold on the water purification system.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the novel, she is still all of these things.  She has apparently made the most progress in the &quot;mildly obsessed with sex&quot; category â€“ she has at least discovered love, to augment lust.  She has plenty of positive characteristics as well, obviously, but the above four were issues I expected to be addressed in her development that were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow River was unexpectedly pro-corporation.  The ethical dilemmas posed by the van de Oest monopoly on the genetically engineered water-purification system are obvious â€“ it allows blatantly artificial price inflation and the eradication of all competition.  None of the characters, besides the huddled masses in Venezuela, ever question the rightness of this.  We already went over this in class, so I will say no more; more interesting to me is the sense of entitlement and subtle arrogance that Lore displays throughout the book.  At her job on Hedon Road, she listens to her superiors speak with a condescending, critical air.  After nearly everything Hepple says as he gives her a tour the first day, she mentally disparages him with thoughts like, &quot;I had learned at age 12, from my uncle Willem, that in a properly run plant the average BOD should never be higher than two ppm, but I didn&#039;t say anything&quot; (30) and &quot;[Hepple was] a little tin god, lording it over his tiny domain.  He wouldn&#039;t have lasted more than a day on one of my projects&quot; (32).  In just these two statements, Lore reminds herself, and the reader, that as an adolescent she already knew better than Hepple, she is connected to the van de Oests, and if she was not in hiding, she would be in control of all her bosses&#039; fates.  With unthinking ease that comes with being of the super-elite, she places herself as superior to everyone else in the plant.  Even Magyar has to prove to Lore that she is not a complete idiot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore tells Magyar her true name, it is with a certain self-satisfied pride.  When Magyar reacts with anger, and not awe, Lore thinks, &quot;But I&#039;m Frances Lorien van de Oest!  Didn&#039;t she know what that meant?  She couldn&#039;t just dismiss me, as if I were anyone else...But she had.  Which is what I wanted, wasn&#039;t it - to be treated as a real person?&lt;br /&gt;
It is the closest Lore comes to self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finished reading, I found myself wondering if Lore&#039;s flat character was faulty writing or some kind of extraordinarily subtle criticism of the sheltered elite on Griffith&#039;s part.  I think that this is swerving dangerously close to trying to identify author&#039;s intent, so I will not attempt to answer that question; rather, I will only comment that Lore is quite an unusual character in a genre that is so often anti-establishment and subversive.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bicurious?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/229</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;so, I&#039;m in the middle of Tank Girl right now. (current judgment=awesome.)&lt;br /&gt;
One totally random thought that has occurred to me: why are the powerful, liberated and sexually liberated women in movies always kissing each other?  Tank Girl makes out with Jet Girl to help her out of a sticky situation, though she has a boyfriend/partner at the start of the film, so she&#039;s not off-limits to men.  My question: is this an indication of their freedom from the proper social constructions of gender and heterosexuality, or is it just another male fantasy to augment the eroticization of powerful women?  If one adheres to Laura Mulvey&#039;s theory that all film is conplicit with the male gaze, the answer would be the latter, but I&#039;m not sure I do agree with her.  Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the end of days</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/200</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the conception of the Apocalypse in Samuel Delaney&#039;s Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand the most interesting part of the book.  Delaney&#039;s idea of how worlds end is so different from other books and from popular thought. For one thing, it is not really an Apocalypse, an end of days â€“ life, and culture, goes on even after a world has been destroyed by that enigmatic thing, the Cultural Fugue.  Secondly, the world does not end by asteroid collision, or by a trigger-happy country with too many nuclear warheads but by information, and by culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters are a little fuzzy in explaining exactly how information and culture destroys worlds, but it does not sound nearly as flashy.  The closest anyone gets to defining what constitutes a Cultural Fugue, that I could find at least, is when Marq Dyeth says Cultural Fugue happens when &quot;the socioeconomic pressuresâ€¦reach a point of technological recomplication and perturbation where the population completely destroys all life across the planetary surface&quot; (66).  Frustratingly vague for a reader who does not know when the critical point of &quot;technological recomplication and perturbation&quot; is generally reached, and how exactly the population destroys itself.  Would a nuclear holocaust fit under the umbrella of the Cultural Fugue?  Even if it does, it is presumably not the only way, so what other dastardly ways does life have of snuffing itself out?  Are they ways we have not even conceived of yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how exactly life ends, the general threat has been deemed to be information.  Exactly how one deals with such a threat is a major point of difference for the political movements of the worlds, but no one seems to deny that it does pose some kind of a threat.  In the prologue, the Rat&#039;s owner describes the boundless knowledge of General Information, then goes on to say: &quot;Can you imagine?  Living in a world where, if you want to know something â€“ anything, anything at all! â€“ all you have to do is think about it, and the answer pops into your head?  That&#039;s supposed to be how it works.  Even our Free-Informationists are scared to go that far.  They think we&#039;d slide over into Cultural Fugue in a minute!&quot; (24).  People need protection, not from guns or bombs or meteors, but from knowledge, which seems so innocuous in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is that the Apocalypse (I&#039;m not sure what else to call it) is something definite, a real threat that has actually happened in the recorded past and will definitely happen again, somewhere, in the future.  It is not some vague threat that may or may not ever happen.  In addition, the concept of the end of the world is not quite so catastrophic in Delaney&#039;s universe.  If one world ends, there are more around to continue.  They are there to take in the few survivors, mourn the dead, and carry on culture and society.  If my planet were to implode in Cultural Fugue, I wonder whether I would be reassured or annoyed that somewhere in the known universe, everyday life is toodling along, unconcerned with my death.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anti-heroes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/184</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This book made me think entirely too hard about things I am not comfortable thinking about - what is human, what is free will, do humans really suck this much, etc etc etc.  Now that I&#039;ve finished, I&#039;m still stuck thinking about it, but I am having a difficult time grounding what I have to say in the text, or even articulating it in something approaching a coherent fashion.  I&#039;ll give it a shot, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing before I start:  Regardless of whether the Contradiction would lead inevitably to human destruction, refusing to help humans continue as humans because they will eventually destroy themselves â€“ because helping them would be like &quot;causing the conception of a child who is so defective that it must die in infancy&quot; â€“ is a little like demanding all fetuses be aborted because men are mortal and will die at some point, anyway (532). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really more of a fantasy than SF girl - I&#039;ve read more fantasy books, good and bad, than I care to admit.  Especially with high fantasy, the stakes tend to be pretty high â€“ set out on this quest to drop this ring in a fiery volcano or the world will end, journey into the mountains to awaken the dragons to save the kingdom, and similar.  (Side note: I know that there are exceptions â€“ I&#039;m running with standard structures here) The main character is often plucked out of obscurity, but because of one thing or another, they are in some way &quot;destined&quot; to carry out this task set to them.  The protagonist sets out on this journey knowing it will be long and hard, and the plot concludes with a great release of the built-up tension â€“ a crashing together of great armies, an epic battle with the evil lord, etc.)  The main character may start out as an everyman, but through his or her actions and words, it becomes clear that the protagonist is suited to the heroic lifestyle, so to speak.  I find it difficult to describe exactly what I mean, but hopefully this makes sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the science fiction books I&#039;ve read fit into this style, as well.  Some, like The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, do not follow this structure, but Offred is never set up to be a hero, never does anything particularly significant on a grand scale; that&#039;s the point of the book.  Lilith&#039;s Brood, on the other hand, repeatedly sets up a scenario perfect for the heroic structure â€“ the woman chosen to lead humans into a new world, the first human-born male construct, the first ooloi construct.  However, none of them are particularly heroic.  Though they never behave as proper, traditional heroes do, through smaller actions they manage to accomplish the same things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of Butler&#039;s protagonists really is an everyman.  Lilith, Akin, and Jodahs actions are dictated by their own and their companions&#039; everyday needs.  It is through these smaller actions that they manage to accomplish such extraordinary things.  They seem less unusual, untouchable, and heroic, and more like regular people who were put in extraordinary situations and managed pretty well.  It is easier for the reader to put themselves in their situation, to relate, and therefore erases much of the the Oankali alien-ness.  It brings out the humanity in the Oankali â€“ or perhaps the Oankali in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Lilith never accepts the role the Oankali give to her as the shepherd of humanity, but neither does she radically reject it.  She just rolls with it, because either radical action is too extreme for her, and it&#039;s easiest to take the middle road.  Even in the last paragraphs of Dawn, she still says, &quot;â€¦perhaps the Oankali were not perfect.  A few fertile people might slip through and find one another.  Perhaps.  Learn and run!  If she were lost, others did not have to be.  Humanity did not have to be&quot; (248).  She does not initiative to become un-lost â€“ that is the job for someone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further rejection of the traditional plot structure, there is no real climax to the trilogy.  The final scene of resistance in the mountain village is pretty anticlimactic â€“ the people have been subdued by Jodah and Aaor&#039;s healing abilities, and when the Oankali ship comes, &quot;there was no panic on the part of the humansâ€¦it was a measure of the Human&#039;s trust that they let Aaor and me and our mates go down to meet the newcomers&quot; (737).  Even the last Human holdouts are defeated gently, by the kindness (and chemicals) of the ooloi, and it is questionable whether they are defeated at all.  They are moving on to a better life on Mars, but they are still behaving as the Oankali want them to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end is ultimately ambiguous; the last sentence of the book, &quot;Seconds after I had expelled it, I felt it begin the tiny positioning movements of independent life,&quot; has no real feeling of conclusion to it (746).  Rather, it hints that life will continue on pretty much as it has through the entire trilogy, and it is through little actions and normal people that change will come.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>large blue men with fin ears = future enslavers of the human race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/177</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I watched a bit of this movie the other day, a 1973 French cartoon called La Planete Sauvage.  I only saw part of it because I got super creeped out by it, but the part that I did see was very reminiscent of Lilith&#039;s Brood to me. Humans are toyed with, what it is to be human is questioned, superior and uncaring aliens screw around with human lives, the whole bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you can find most of it dubbed over into English on youtube.  Watch it if you want to feel like you are on hard drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>barbarella as feminist?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/132</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I think Barbarella rocks.  Also, I found it to be suprisingly feminist, considering - well, considering everything.  On the surface it&#039;s pretty wonderful in its unselfconscious exploitation of Fonda&#039;s sexuality, but its underlying concepts are much more subversive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.  The guy that sticks around the longest in the film, and the closest thing the film has to a male protagonist.  He&#039;s far from being the standard hero type; actually he&#039;s pretty useless.  He walks into walls and just stands around until Barbarella shouts directions at him, which he quickly obeys before lapsing back into passivity.  She thanks him for saving her life in the appropriately breathless damsel-in-distress fashion, but it&#039;s pretty clear to the audience that he was little more than an extra set of appendages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Barbarella wastes a lot of time repeatedly rescuing him.  She returns to Pygar his power of flight and tells the evil tyrant to &#039;decrucify the angel or I&#039;ll MELT YOUR FACE,&#039; among other things.  He never really redeems himself.  True, he flies Barbarella into and out of the tyrant&#039;s liar, but the way Barbarella asks, the viewer gets the impression that he&#039;s just the quickest and cheapest mode of transportation and she could find another way if she REALLY wanted.  He acts as little more than motivation for the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any strong male character there to hijack the movie from her, Barbarella is the undisputed star of the show.  Yes, she sleeps with pretty much every (post-puberty) male character she encounters, but she does it without really being sexual at all.  Men beg to sleep with her, and if it&#039;s in her best interests, she shrugs cheerily and says okay.  Sex isn&#039;t taboo, dangerous, or shameful at all for her, so she has no resigned, defeated air of a woman with no other options - no &#039;weeping vrgin&#039; stereotype.  And though she often sleeps with men as a means to an end, neither does she destroy them as do exoticised &#039;black widow&#039; character types.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the movie has distinctly pornographic overtones, it is difficult to really place Barbarella (the character, though not Jane Fonda the actress) in a traditional position of desire.  There is no thrill of excitement, danger, or taboo with her, and it&#039;s much harder to desire and lust over a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Children of Men!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/99</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last summer I managed to read/watch both versions of Children of Men.  My faulty memory has since swept most of the details away, but armed with some wikipedia articles as refreshers, I think I can get most of the important details back again.  As an opener:  this is one of those rare pairs of book &amp;amp; adaptation that are both totally incredible without being carbon copies of one another.  And, any director/cinematographer/actor that can handle a single 5 minute shot of people dying, shooting, and blowing things up is totally out of Hollywood&#039;s league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children of Men deals with the same basic concept of &quot;creeping infertility,&quot; as Prof. Fitzpatrick put it so well.  In P.D. James&#039;s world however, this infertility was sudden and complete.  Gilead&#039;s women can still get pregnant and occasionally pop out a healthy kid, but in Children of Men, all of a sudden, babies stopped coming, and 25 years later, there still aren&#039;t any.  In most other ways, James&#039;s future society is pretty similar to Atwood&#039;s - crazy totalitarian regime, seriously repressive society, hate for non-whites, etc. etc.  The crucial difference, though, is that everyone is living without hope.  Essentially, the world is ending, and nobody&#039;s really handling it very well.  People are rapidly descending to their most animalistic instincts and/or sinking into apathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I think, is where these two books are so cool to compare.  In Handmaid&#039;s Tale, there is still hope, people are still working toward some sort of purpose, though they are doing it in a pretty messed up way.  Everyday society is fairly peaceful, and everyone has something to hope for and work towards, at least.  The people of Children of Men are facing a world that, in 50 years or so, will straight-up have no people in it.  When faced with that despair (which the film captures with SO much more subtlely and skill than the Handmaid&#039;s Tale movie), I&#039;m not sure what I personally would do.  What&#039;s the point of learning, writing, creating art, making money, doing anything, really, if anything new you manage to bring to the world will a) be buried under the far more important issue of the spieces&#039;s slow death and b) won&#039;t last past the final human&#039;s memory anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death is pretty flippin scary for most people, but knowing that a kind of immortality could be achieved, that you could improve or change the world somehow if you did something cool enough, is comforting.  Knowing that you&#039;re going to become completely irrelevant in the near future no matter what you do is probably a motivation-killer for a lot of people.  How James&#039;s society dealt with this impending doom is pretty depressing but, I think, definitely a possible scenario.  People are basically living as animals, killing their elderly - heck, killing each other, too.  With the end in sight, all of the worst bits of our nature come out into the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scenario I like much better is in Alan Lightman&#039;s book, Einstein&#039;s Dreams.  In one of the short stories, the world has a set day on which it will end - fairly similar to Children of Men.  In Lightman&#039;s world, businesses and schools shut down, but knowing that everyone&#039;s going to die soon anyway, that they are all headed together to the same end, the world&#039;s population unites, more or less, and the world ends in piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wonder is which scenario is more likely, should some such event put us in some kind of similar situation.  Will the worst of human nature come out, or the best?  Or will we just toodle along, just as we always do, and just sort of fade unspectacularly away?  I&#039;m a pessimist who wants to be an optimist, so I&#039;m curious about what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>god, hollywood sucks at life.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that this was the first week the book and the movie could be so directly contrasted, the differences between literary and Hollywood conceptions of what makes a good story really struck me.  My generalized conclusion:  Hollywood is SO LAME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I found the widespread tendency toward inaction especially disturbing, but also the most relevant to today.  Some things Offred said â€“ &#039;I took too much for granted; I trusted fate, back then,&#039; for example, or &#039;We lived by ignoring.  Ignoring isn&#039;t the same as ignorance, you have to work at itâ€¦&#039; â€“ struck me as very true and real (27, 53).  Laziness, or apathy, or ignoring, is a pretty powerful force.  It seems almost plausible that the country would allow a force to slowly gather power as the population ignored it until it was too late, when it would slip fairly quietly into control.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laziness is not an enemy that translates very well onto the screen, though, so the movie changes it up, and destroys much of the story&#039;s power in the process.  That a country as populous as the United States could be subdued purely by military force, which is what seemed implied by the movie, is so much more unlikely (and therefore distant and safe to its audience).  Atwood constructs a scenario that one could see actually occurring; the movie is just a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, most people do not seem too pleased with the new arrangement; the second scene in particular depicts a forced subduing.  They are reminiscent of film portrayals of Nazi Germany, with soldiers corralling the undesirables into trains and trucks like cattle (as oh-so-subtle truck with the crossed-out label &#039;livestock&#039; points out) and carting them off to certain death.  The book distances itself from such disturbing scenes, making it easier for the reader to slip into the same apathy that Offred does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the people fight what is happening to them â€“ they make the soldiers shove them around, they try to escape, they resist, instead of just standing around as this new totalitarian regime is built around them.  Throughout the movie, there are references to the ongoing war that indicate a more widespread discontent and organized resistance than the book.  Not only are the rebels powerful enough to disrupt fruit shipments from California and Florida, the handmaids know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movie, Kate (she has a name! an independent identity!) is quite a bit more feisty, as well.  She is not submissive â€“ at least any more than so many Hollywood leading ladies are.  She challenges the commander, falls into an affair with Nick at an absurd speed, and even helps Moira bind and gag Aunt Lydia when Moira escapes.  She is a Hollywood hero â€“ she takes risks, stands out, does what others are too cowardly to.  Atwood&#039;s Offred admits she does nothing and is reduced to reveling in the power she has, &#039;[the] power of a dog bone, passive but there&#039; (30).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie gives her much more motivation to resist.  For one thing, there is still a sense of community among the characters; they do not exist in their own little bubbles of fear and isolation.  In the book, Offred does not trust anyone, fearing Nick to be an Eye and saying of Rita, &#039;Why tempt her friendship?&#039; (15).  Kate has to fear only the soldiers and the government they represent.  Just as powerful, but at least she knows who they are.  They don&#039;t hide as handmaids, wives, or drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Offred of the book can describe the Ceremony scenes with an almost clinical distance. &#039;Below [my skirt] the Commander is fucking.  What he is fucking is the lower part of my bodyâ€¦rape [doesn&#039;t] cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven&#039;t signed on for&#039; (121).  The Ceremony of the film reads much more like a rape scene, with Kate crying loudly though most of the first one, and the Commander is sort of a lecherous old man â€“ easy to hate him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film, her life is bad enough, and her motivation (finding her daughter) strong enough that NOT acting seems inconceivable.  The book&#039;s Offred is not in a living hell so much as in a vaguely unpleasant place, and the risks of leaving it are much too high.  Inaction is much easier, and it&#039;s a pretty steep and short slope from inaction to apathy to acceptance.  Atwood&#039;s world is a much scarier, and much realer, place.  Hollywood cannot deal with anything less than five steps removed from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Offred</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/85</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as I was toodling along and reading Handmaid&#039;s tale, I realized that I didn&#039;t know the protagonist&#039;s name, so I wiki-ed it.  I found it out, but hadn&#039;t yet gotten to the part with the explanation of WHY she was called Offred, so I just figured Atwood had made it up.  What I noticed about it was how similar it was to the word &#039;offered.&#039;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think this could possibly be a coincidence; Offred is &#039;offered&#039; to so many people.  She is offered to the Commander, as well as Serena Joy and the rest of the household, to Nick, to the Eyes at the end of the novel, to the larger machinations of the society.  She, as the narrator and representative of all the handmaids of Gilead, is offered to future scholars (and the reader) as a way to gain insight into the women&#039;s minds of that time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of this, she &#039;is offered&#039;; she never offers herself.  There is a passivity in this offering that is, I think, very similar to the one that she berates herself about in the time before.  Her little rebellions and transgressions, though they do carry a serious penalty, are ultimately pretty minor.  Whether it&#039;s laziness, inertia, the paralyzing power of fear, or something else, she pretty much lets everyone else decide her fate for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t mean to judge her actions or imply that she should have done something different, but she does let others offer her up with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>peace at last in an old, old war</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/74</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I see that the body/mind issue has already been raised in responses, I&#039;m really interested in how Gibson addresses this, and I think I can take a sufficiently original tack that my response will further the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between mind and body is given a very complex treatment in Neuromancer, full of apparent contradictions that I am still trying to work out.  On the one hand, the mind in Neuromancer is closer than ever to being able to transcend the physical body as it travels through cyberspace; on the other, the mind/body divide is becoming irrelevant as body modifications allow the body and mind to better reflect each other.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of my other classes, we just discussed an article by Kenneth Clark in which he pinpoints the genesis of the schism between mind and body.  In classical times, according to him, the body and spirit were one; gods were embodied, and athleticism (or perfecting of the body) was considered a type of worship.  By the Renaissance, however, the body was the source of sin, dirty and shameful: something that the mind had to strive to escape.  In Neuromancer, even as Gibson imposes our society&#039;s battle of mind and body onto his characters, the world he has created contains a potential solution to the battle, waiting to be found.&lt;br /&gt;
Case is a perfect example of the fight for the mind to defeat the imperfect, shameful body.  With his neurons fried and unable to loose his mind into cyberspace, he &quot;[falls] into the prison of his own flesh&quot; and is forced to confront his own embodiment (6).  He is unable to accept that he is tied to a body, and conditioned by the cowboy culture to hold &quot;a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh,&quot; he throws himself into an &quot;arc of his self-destruction&quot; that will unquestionably get him killed quickly (6,7).  In today&#039;s â€“ Gibson&#039;s â€“ world, we cannot escape the fact that we are bounded by our bodies and are incapable of full transcendence. Case had a taste of what transcendence is like.  When he re-enters cyberspace for the first time, he describes it as &quot;his distanceless home, his country&quot; while his body remains behind &quot;somewhere,&quot; laughing and moving but now entirely separate from his consciousness (52).&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson is so busy indulging our fantasy of, through technology, getting closer to defeating the body that he does not take advantage of the technology that could potentially resolve the body v. mind war.  Escaping the body would no longer be necessary.  Body modifications are, in our world and Case&#039;s, a way for the consciousness of the mind to mark the natural body to which it belongs.  It somewhat externalizes the mind and links the mind and body.  The outer body and the inner mind are brought closer into alignment.  In Neuromancer, modifications are no longer limited to piercings, tattoos, scarring, and an occasional plastic surgery.  Pretty much anything is possible, aesthetic or practical. The Panther Modern leader, heading up a flashy terrorist group, adds color, changes pupils, shapes features until he resembles &quot;some kind of a state of the art gargoyle&quot; more than a human (67).  Molly&#039;s job and identity is that of a fighter, so she adds retractable scalpel blades to her hands (25).  The technology of Neuromancer allows the members of its population to prod, pierce, and pull at their bodies until it reflects the inner mind.  Conversely, additions to the body can affect the mind; attaching microsofts to the body grants the individual new knowledge and abilities.  Through these additions, subtractions, and modifications, the mind and body reflect each other perfectly and can me integrated into a single, harmonious entity.  n this way, technology is no longer needed as a tool to defeat either mind or body; it erases the need for the war altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darn.  I was hoping for feedback on this idea, because I feel like it&#039;s a little out in space, but I took a really long time to write it and now it&#039;s really late and everyone sane has already finished blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Perhaps the film isn&#039;t totally ridiculous...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/38</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Heinlein is not overly concerned with subtlety.  Perhaps fearful of some particularly dense reader missing his unmitigated support of the military, big government and capital punishment, Heinlein places only the thinnest of sci-fi veils over his long-winded political monologues.  This does not make it a bad read â€“ the plot is still compelling â€“ but when I reach the scenes of History and Moral Philosophy classes, I do want to throw something at him, as roseblack says.  This future world in which Johnny Rico operates has indeed been radically altered.  The military has risen in power and influence, technological advances are responsible for major military and social changes, and the increased globalization of Terra has resulted in cultural assimilation.  The film version, while truly atrocious when taken seriously, takes on a new and deeper meaning when read as an oppositional text.&lt;br /&gt;
As Heinlein portrays it, Rico&#039;s society is near perfect, or at least a great improvement on our own.  The new style of democracy &quot;insure[s] that all who wield it [the vote] accept the ultimate in social responsibilityâ€¦to wager his own lifeâ€¦to save the life of the state&quot; (184).  The Federation of the film, however, has definite fascist tendencies; they control voting rights, reproductive rights, and the media.  Significant segments are viewed through the Federation&#039;s media channel, heavily laden with World War II style propaganda and an almost sadistic celebration of executions and gore.  An authoritative male voice narrates, and in one advertisement asks &quot;Want to know more?&quot; over the sound of a crowd cheering at a death sentence.  They seem more to be hallmarks of a dystopia than a perfected society.&lt;br /&gt;
The main character, Juan Rico, is renamed John Rico in the film, the actor&#039;s blonde hair and blue eyes stereotypically Anglo.  It underlines the loss of ethnic and cultural diversity in Starship Troopers, something that Heinlein glosses over or even celebrates in his writing. In the book, Rico is from Buenos Aires but is still an English speaker.  He is part of the social elite, one of the richest of his peers, part of the hegemonic order that clearly adheres to a Western patriarchal society&#039;s ideals.  Globalization has destroyed all other culture&#039;s values.  The film highlights this in its transformation of Rico, indicating his adherence to our social order.  Further underlining this Western hegemony is the only Hispanic in the movie, a fellow member of boot camp who admits he is only in the military because his family does not have enough money to send him to Harvard, placing him in the same lower classes than the current stereotyped image of Hispanics today.  Religion, pretty much the most powerful divider throughout human history, has only the slightest presence in the book, meriting only a passing mention in the beginning that the same Catholic priest is sufficient for &quot;Moslems, Christians, Gnostics, Jewsâ€¦&quot;(4).  Even religion does not really matter anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
A final stake to the heart of the book is in the film&#039;s battle scenes.  Heinlein&#039;s military is at its peak of efficiency and power.  The M.I. are superhuman, well-trained killing machines.  In appearance, the film&#039;s soldiers are barely different from today&#039;s; the only improvement seems to be the increased presence of nuclear weapons, which are more just big bombs than the ultimate in death and destruction.  Soldiers run in disorderly swarms across the screen, firing indiscriminately, and poorly, in the general direction of the Bugs before beating a hasty, and often cowardly, retreat.  They come across as badly trained and just plain unequipped to deal with a threat, rather than the book&#039;s depiction of a dominant fighting force that has finally met its match in the Bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The only thing to do with a &#039;cult favorite&#039;: SEQUEL!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/30</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Because in Hollywood-speak, &#039;a horrible movie&#039; is called a &#039;cult favorite&#039; and sequels rule the universe, Sony Pictures in 2004 put out &#039;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation&#039;, a &#039;rapid-fire sequel to the cult favorite, [in which] the Federation&#039;s best Mobile Infantry unit goes back into action against the Bug horde.&#039;  A straight-to-DVD masterpiece!&lt;br /&gt;
And, according to imdb, they&#039;re making a THIRD one starring the original Johnny.  Really?  Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad photoshopped poster is worth a visit.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>WTF, Paul Verhoeven.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/26</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently 4 minutes and 15 seconds into the movie Starship troopers, and I am absolutely sure that is has the worst opening sequence I have ever witnessed.  Perhaps it is because I just recently saw Cloverfield, which went a little too far down the documentary/shaky-cam road, but the little sequence &#039;on the battlefield&#039; was RIDICULOUS.  Let&#039;s even put aside the fact that a trained soldier continues to talk to the camera even though a Bug has (not sneakily at all) come around the corner and is about to snatch the soldier up in his semi-CGI, animatronic-looking maw.  Let&#039;s put aside the fact that the soldier takes time to shout over the sound of gunfire and comment, in melodramatic terms, on the aesthetics of the planet he&#039;s landed on.  We are evidently supposed to believe that the camera is being held by someone on the news crew, unarmed.  SO WHAT IS HE DOING??  The Bug comes roaring around a rock and bites a few soldiers in half, and he just stands there, evidently intelligent enough to aim the camera into the action but not intelligent enough to remove himself to a safer location (namely not one within arm&#039;s-length of the Bug).  He also has the steadiest hand I have ever seen, capable of smoothly swinging from Bug to shouting soldiers and back again.  He can apparently do this even while running; perhaps this is why he appears to be moving no faster than a brisk trot.  Once this faceless, brainless camera man has been put out of his misery by the Bug, his camera falls to the ground, allowing Rico to crawl toward it, his blindingly white teeth clenched prettily in pain and his eyes still open slightly, as if he is checking to make sure that he is still in frame so his bravery can be appropriately documented.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that came out more like a rant than I intended.  I apologize.  Please look to &#039;to whitewash or not to whitewash&#039; for a more measured and rational example of my response to Starship Troopers.&lt;/p&gt;
