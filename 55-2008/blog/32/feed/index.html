 <title>One last response</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Contains season 2 spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my last shot at extra credit, though BSG is still fresh and new enough in my mind that I&#039;m pretty hesitant to dissect it.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen three texts so far this semester that deal with the almost total extinction of the human race.  Of the three, to me it seems that Battlestar Galactica presents the best case that the humans are worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;
In Xenogenesis the resisters fight for the preservation of humanity, but the version of humanity they represent really doesn&#039;t seem worth preserving.  They exhibit violence and racism. They turn on even the other humans, raid their camps and steal their women.  Some of them refuse to fraternize with humans of different skin tones, even when there are so few humans left at all.  In Oryx and Crake the humans also seemed beyond redemption.  They had reached new lows in depravity, in science (the ChickieNobs &quot;chickens&quot;) and recreation (Crake and Jimmy&#039;s internet hotspots).&lt;br /&gt;
	Battlestar Galactica is the first time that we seem (a non-mad-scientist) human really realize the flaws within the human race, and come to the conclusion that we might not be worth saving.  And yet I think that it&#039;s the most hopeful in that respect of the three texts.  The survivors are generally speaking pretty likable, more so than the resisters in Xenogenesis and Oryx and Crake&#039;s Snowman.  I&#039;m only partway through season two, so I don&#039;t have a fully developed picture of the Pegasus crew yet, but so far they really reinforce just how likeable the other humans are.  They serve as a foil for the Galactica crew in multiple ways.  They show just how little the Galactica crew uphold the hierarchical aspect of human nature.  As military establishments go Galactica&#039;s is very relaxed.  They are less robotic, and more human, as D&#039;anna Biers pointed out in her documentary.  The Pegasus crew&#039;s disturbing nonchalance toward the abuse of the 6 aboard their ship also shows just how little the Galactica crew members give in to typical military machismo.&lt;br /&gt;
	It also seems that the humans can be taught acceptance and understanding.  For all the 6&#039;s claim that Gaius isn&#039;t really a (human) man until he has killed, the trend in the show is more toward acceptance than destruction.  Helo completely accepts his love for Sharon.  He looks forward to her bearing their hybrid child.  Then in an ultimate act of loyalty, he and the chief kill for her.  Even Gaius honestly seems to love his 6.  Though admittedly most of his professions of love stem ultimately from his ongoing instinct for self-preservation rather than an expression of any conscious feeling, he&#039;s on the verge of tears when he sees her in pain aboard the Pegasus.  The people who do mistreat the Cylons are the &quot;bad&quot; humans: Case, Thorne, the crew members of the Pegasus.&lt;br /&gt;
	Though the humans in BSG are clearly not in the midst of a utopian society, the series seems to present the idea that if given a second chance, they might be able to establish a functional relatively accepting society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Problems with race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/364</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, the representations of gender in the show are pretty sophisticated, I was impressed in that respect.  I&#039;m much less impressed with their treatment of race.  In particular, why are all the most religious characters black?  I&#039;m delving a little into the beginning of season two here, but there&#039;s Roslin&#039;s (spiritual?) adviser (the one who realizes the importance of the 12 serpents),  her guard in the brig, and the quorum member from Gemenon.  It makes me a little uncomfortable...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Military Question</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/359</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a embarrassing revealing of my lack of knowledge on the workings of the military, but does our military use &quot;sir&quot; to address women in command?  Or is that a convention invented for the show?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Crake vs. the Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/340</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we very briefly touched on this in class today, but I was interested in the parallels between Oryx and Crake and Xenogenesis.  Clearly, the biggest parallel was that the human race ends up wiped out and reformatted against its will, for its own good (or so someone claims).  The narration of both novels takes place at least mostly in the immediate aftermath.  The initial struggle for survival removes the capacity to act in the ways that initially caused the downfall of the human race, but in both novels, there&#039;s the suggestion that this fix is temporary, and the situation will degenerate in to what it was before.  This shows up through the reappearance of guns in Xenogenesis, as well as the overall degeneration of the resister colonies into violence.  In Oryx and Crake it manifests in the effigy the Crakers build of Snowman.  Crake &quot;programmed&quot; them through genetic engineering not to have the capacity to create abstract art, because he thought it was tied in to a tendency to invent religion, and then to wage war. Even if he&#039;s wrong in making that connection, the fact that they do have the capacity create these abstract figures suggests that he may not have successfully removed more explicitly harmful human characteristics.  &quot;Next they&#039;d be inventing idols, and funerals, and grave goods, and the afterlife, and sin, and Linear B, and kings, and then slavery and war&quot; (361).  Then the mass slaughter of humanity would have occurred for absolutely no reason at all.  Both books present the &quot;better&quot; reconstructed human race as transient, suggesting that the efforts to fix us are futile.&lt;br /&gt;
I think the most important difference between the two novels is what happened before the restructuring of humanity occurred.  Both the Oankali and Crake saw the destruction of the human race as inevitable, before it happened.  Crake make a preemptive strike and he wiped the human slate clean before it imploded so he could impose his own perception of what humanity should be.  The Oankali recognized the fatal flaw of the humans before the nuclear holocaust happened, but did not step in to prevent the damage.  They waited out the inevitable death and destruction, and then swooped down on the planet and performed their human reformatting, and which point they could present themselves as the saviors of the human race, as they performed their biological imperative.  They seem more like the vultures that plague Snowman as he walks across the newly formed wasteland than saviors.&lt;br /&gt;
So which is worse, the actions of Crake, or the inaction of the Oankali?  Both are delusional in that they believe they are acting in the best interest of humanity.  But Crake at least realizes to a certain extent that he may have gone a little too far.  He can&#039;t let himself see his own creation.  He put in an official standing order for Jimmy to take over if &quot;anything happens&quot; to him and mentions that at that point Oryx wouldn&#039;t be around either, suggesting that he planned his suicide long before the actual event (320).  Some form of guilt or uneasiness had to have overcome his megalomaniacal tendencies not to get the satisfaction of watching his children flourish.  The Oankali experience no such pangs of guilt, they are happy not to even leave any human akjai before Akin fights for that right.  And though they did not orchestrate the mass murder of millions of humans in the same direct manner that Crake did, they certainly did nothing to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;
So I&#039;m curious, who do you guys think is more nefarious?  Crake or the Oankali?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hopkinson&#039;s Anti-Posthumanism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/291</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a topic we talked about a little in class today, but since my paper is on posthumanism, I&#039;m having a little trouble thinking about anything else, so I&#039;m going to go for it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;
To my mind, this is one of the most anti-posthumanist novels we&#039;ve read thus far in the class, which I find most interesting considering just how little the novel exposes us to advanced technology, since most of the storyline takes place in the primitive society of New Half-Way Tree.  Hopkinson does a little bit of the typical anti-transhumanism presentation in the obvious perversity of a theoretically positive advance. Generally speaking, I get so caught up in the storyline of a novel that I have a hard time picking up on subtle undertones, components of a universe that are overtly presented as positive, when really maybe we&#039;re supposed to see them as nefarious.  I have the worst time with unpleasant technological advances, because my first inclination is to think of technology as progressive.  But when Ione realizes the sheriffs are arresting Antonio and says &quot;Nanny save we!&quot; I was profoundly disturbed (64).  The grand anansi is so powerful, that its nickname is used in place of God.  It happens again, after he finds out Quashee is dead, Antonio says &quot;Nanny have mercy&quot; where the implied continued thought is â€¦on my soul (70).  Nanny has become so pervasive that people are essentially praying to a machine for salvation.  There&#039;s also the very creepy final passage, when we realize that the nanobots have made their way into Tan-Tan&#039;s child, without Tan-Tan&#039;s consent, let alone the child&#039;s.&lt;br /&gt;
I also see the novel as anti-transhumanist in its absolute corporeality. One of the overarching goals for posthumanists is to fully disengage from the body, and become an unbounded entity in cyberspace, or some analogous structure, as we saw with Case in Neuromancer.  Nalo Hopkinson rejects disembodiment and fully embraces the importance of corporal reality.  We see this, as mentioned in class, in the fact that the technology (nanomites) inhabits the body, rather than having the mind moving into cyberspace.  I also see it in Tan-Tan&#039;s pregnancy.  Incorporating such a purely physical phenomenon into the story reinforces the importance of the corporal over the ethereal.  I also read Brown Girl in the Ring, and see a similar trend in that novel as well.  Again, the human bodies are possessed, and actually physically changed by the spirits.  The main character resolves a conflict by hands-on fighting, which we haven&#039;t seen much of previously in this class.  In an altered state, she lifts a man off the ground with two fingers.  The most powerful force in the book, the duppy-bowl is powered by human blood rather than code, thoughts, or information, and to break its power, the main character has to break a physical object, which, once broken, reveals all the physical things its made of: &quot;reeking clumps of dirt; a twist of hair; white knuckle bones; the black, mummified body of what looked like a dead cat&quot; (204).  The final showdown then makes the conflict explicit.  The villain says &quot;that body don&#039;t have to be your home no more. You don&#039;t have to feel pain no more, sweetheart.  Your granddaddy could help you.  After I speak the right words, the powder you take will give your spirit strength to act on it own, without the body.  Let your spirit talk to me&quot; (216).  And though over the course of the novel, the main character expresses a fair amount of discontent with her body, she overcomes that discontent and rejects becoming a disembodied entity, regardless of the pain her body sometimes brings.&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I thought it was very cool that Hopkinson could push away technology not only using the typical presentation of a seemingly benevolent technology gone horribly, horribly wrong, but also through a very firm embrace of the natural, corporeal world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Information Obsession</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/259</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found most interesting about Snow Crash was its treatment of information.  Clearly in this world information, or &quot;intel&quot; abounds.  The desire for information takes precedence over privacy, as exemplified by Hiro&#039;s experience with the Mob, described at the very beginning of the novel, &quot;he&#039;s in their database now...retinal patterns, DNA, void graph fingerprints, foot prints, palm prints, wrist prints, every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on it and digitized it into their computer&quot; (6).  This information typically not help private by whoever took record of it.  You either need cash or clearance to access any given piece, but once you have those things, the information you can expose yourself to is pretty unlimited, and accessible, as evidenced by Hiro&#039;s description of the Gargoyles.  &quot;You think they&#039;re talking to you,&quot; he explains &quot;but they&#039;re actually poring over the credit record of some stranger on the other side of the room, or identifying the make and model of airplanes plying overhead&quot; (125).&lt;br /&gt;
	I found this reminiscent of the net in &quot;Stars in my Pocket.&quot;  Access to the huge database of information is more widespread in Delany&#039;s world than in Snow Crash, but for those who can access it, the scale of the information seems to be just as broad.  However, the implications of these huge collections of data were different in the two novels.  In Delany&#039;s novel, being exposed to such absurd quantities of information seemed to make any given piece of information arbitrary.  Since it was so obvious that any given person knew such a small proportion of the total information, they didn&#039;t really think of facts as objective things, rather they&#039;re thought of as on the same level as poetry.  The interpretation of information was more important than the information itself.  But in &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; information is power, and money.  Hiro supports himself by collecting &quot;intel&quot; and collecting royalties whenever anyone pays to access it.  Even the most inane of conversations have the potential to bring in the big bucks.  In The Black Sun he overhears a screenwriter complaining about a director who wanted to put a bazooka in a movie.  After Hiro puts the conversation into the Library &quot;a hundred struggling screenwriters will call this conversation up, listen to it over and over until they&#039;ve got it memorized, paying Hiro for the privilege&quot; (65).&lt;br /&gt;
	The obsession with information even bleeds into the narrative of the novel.  The first two pages are rife with metaphor.  &quot;His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.  A bullet will bounce off its arachno-fiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest.  Where his body has bony extremities the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.  To me, this goes beyond world building and screams &quot;Look! I know so much that I can use the properties of activated charcoal and napalm in similes!&quot; Everything is cross-linked and referenced the way that Hiro links up the information he puts in the library.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Heroes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if anyone here has ever watched Heroes, the television show, but whoever was in charge of the script for that show apparently loves Snow Crash.  There&#039;s the fact that they also named their protagonist Hiro (though I was prepared to write that off as a coincidence, because it is still a play on words).  And then I came across Odessa Texas (which is where most of the action is centered in the first season).  No way is that a coincidence, right?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much identity!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/232</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I would agree with Moller when she says that to label this novel solely as a humanist work about the nature of human identity completely misses the novel&#039;s social and political ramifications, the exploration of identity is an interesting facet of the novel to explore.  It&#039;s also such an obvious part of the novel, that to ignore it is impossible.  Lore has three &quot;identities,&quot; as represented by the different tenses and perspectives, as we talked about in class.  Not only does each Lore&#039;s storyline end with a convenient climax, they also begin with a birth.  First, her original birth.  Then she arrives naked &quot;curled in a fetal position&quot; in a new city (5).  Then, she implants herself with a new identity.  But the overarching question remains, are these rebirths really new starts, or are they just the same Lore, but in a new environment?  I see the novel as presenting two pretty conflicting ideas of identity.  The first is that there is some sort of intrinsic identity, that who you are is static, even in the face of a changing environment.  At other times, the novel seems to suggest that your identity is based more on other people&#039;s perceptions of you than anything inherent within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Nature is a strong theme in the novel, more so than in a lot of the other novels we&#039;re read this semester. It is set soon enough in the future that wild things still exists, but far enough away that they are more precious, so when they do show up, they are significant.  Lore describes the trees dying in Spanner&#039;s apartment as strong, you can &quot;drench it in acid rain and infest it with parasites, carve initials in its bark and split branch from trunk, and it will survive&quot; (56).  External conditions don&#039;t wear down the tree, even under outside pressures, it keeps going.  Similarly, Lore continues to be Lore even with the outside pressure to be Sal Bird.  She wants to adopt Sal Bird&#039;s identity, say only the types of things Sal Bird would say, but because she &quot;couldn&#039;t bear to see a system fail due to simple ignorance&quot; she knowingly risks being found out (75).  There are certain aspects of herself that Lore simply cannot suppress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	At the same time, Lore is strongly affected by her interpersonal relationships.  With Spanner, she does some terrible things that she would not have done otherwise.  After a particularly bad night, she vomits in disgust at her actions and repeats &quot;It wasn&#039;t me, it wasn&#039;t meâ€¦&quot; (262).  She knows that her old self would be disgusted with what she does now somewhat willingly, as she admits to Spanner.  Also, Lore thoroughly discards her identity as a van de Oest after the kidnapping.  She dyes her hair, adopts an accent and discards her family as always having been different from her.  However, the moment someone besides Spanner learns that she is in fact a van de Oest, she falls back into old patterns.  She is a van de Oest. Magyar she said &quot;couldn&#039;t just dismiss me, as if I were anyone else&quot; (282).  So here, it seems Lore seems to be who other people think Lore is, rather than having an identity based on anything she creates herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I&#039;m not sure whether Griffith was trying to push one perspective or the other, though I&#039;m inclined to think that we are more outwardly determined than we would like to think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Azi Musings</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/215</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this novel was absurdly huge, straight up finishing over break was more important than annotating at the time, unfortunately, but here it goes.&lt;br /&gt;
There were lots of interesting facets to this novel, which made getting through it a lot easier, but one of the most interesting parts was the Azi.  Cherryh never really explains the process of their creation.  We get small snippets over the course of the novel, and can piece together some sort of idea of how they&#039;re made.  We learn that they were initially created as filler for too-empty populations, to stimulate economic growth.  There were insufficient adults to give the children they needed individual attention, so Resune developed tape-learning, and raised the Azi synthetically instead.  They were a solution to a problem initially, a sort of ready-made human, but I didn&#039;t get the feeling that, at least originally, they were anything like slaves.&lt;br /&gt;
Tape learning teaches incredibly specific skills, like penmanship and horseback riding, so that method of teaching allowed for the creation of incredibly specific behaviors. Such incredible specificity led to the creation of azi to fill specific roles, rather than general bodies capable of stimulating the economy.  The &quot;batches&quot; of azi are defined by their genesets, and have tape designed specifically for each geneset.  These batches range from the Rho-class which has an &quot;Rezner [score of] 45 and below&quot; and an &quot;ability to rebound from mishandling and bad tape&quot; and is used for experimentation and general labor, to the alphas which score upward from 150 on the Rezner scale and are generated &quot;only rarely except for specific executive assignments&quot; (29-30).  Thus we have selective breeding, as never before seen by humans, performed on humans.  The creation of individuals for specific societal roles is not exactly slavery, but it certainly causes some problems with free will.  The reasearchers in charge of the tape program reward systems into the azi.  Justin&#039;s pet project is changing these systems so that the azi get pleasure directly from the work that the programmers choose that the azi should do.  This really seems to be absurdly specific selective breeding.  In the initial world-setting stage of the book an educational publication states, &quot;AGCULT-789X, experimental as the X-designation indicates, closely resembles the RYX-20s or the EU-4561s, except that the genetic codes of the RYX-20s and the EU-4561s indicate two feet while that of AGCULT-789X indicates for, and the RYX-20&#039;s and the EU-4651&#039;s codes indicate smooth skin, while AGCULT-789X&#039;s indicates a sleek bay hide and a superlative ability to run&quot; (31).  The RYX-20s and EU4561s are azi and the AGCULT-789X are horses, the only difference between the azi and the livestock are number of legs, hide type, and speed.&lt;br /&gt;
As disturbing as this all seems however, the azi certainly aren&#039;t unhappy with their programming, and they understand that they are programmed.  There are benefits to being an azi.  Since they&#039;re programmed for whatever function they perform, they are, generally speaking, impeccable in their performance.  All the security in the novel are azi because no one would prefer human body guard with slow reaction times when they could have Catlin instead.  And born-men have their own problems.  &quot;Excited born-men go to alternate programming sets. Every born-man is a schiz,&quot; Grant says, &quot;And he hates his alter ego&quot; (240).  Grant even says that he prefers his &quot;natural&quot; psychset (240).&lt;br /&gt;
The problem I think, is being an azi in a born-men world.  Azi are superior to born-men in many ways, but the born-men take them for granted.  At one point Grant gets incredibly frustrated with the born-men (including Justin) for not listening to an azi&#039;s point of view &quot;There&#039;s listening and listening,&quot; he says &quot;They&#039;ll always listen to me, when they won&#039;t, you.  But they won&#039;t listen to me the way they do you.  No more than they do Willâ€¦ they won&#039;t take his word&quot; and its because he&#039;s an azi (429).   That attitude of the born men is not only unfair, its stupid.  Grant points out at the beginning of the novel that azi and born-men have their strengths and weaknesses.  The azi take in every detail, weed out inconsistencies, which is why they can quickly process certain problems that the born-men can&#039;t even hold in their head.  He explains to Justin that as a born-man &quot;you&#039;re better at averaging shades than you are at remembering what really happened, that&#039;s how you can process things that come at you fast and from all sides.  And that&#039;s what we&#039;re worst at&quot; (154).&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though azi are treated like second-class citizens, or even livestock, they aren&#039;t inferior to the men who create them, they are better in certain respects.  And they&#039;re happy being azi, when born-men don&#039;t get in the way.  So it doesn&#039;t really seem necessarily bad to be an azi.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Morality in Lilith&#039;s Brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/169</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We spent a large part of our in-class discussion on Lilith&#039;s talking about the morality of the Oankali&#039;s actions toward humanity.  They were described as immoral, amoral, devious.  What I think Lilith&#039;s Brood shows us is that what we, as humans, think of as absolute morals are actually incredibly slippery and ephemeral things.&lt;br /&gt;
	The resisters reject living with Oankali because they refuse to mate with the Oankali, regardless of the pleasure it provides, regardless of the fact that doing so is the only way that they can propagate their genes.  For them, to create half-breed children is worse than the possibility of never having children at all, to create constructs is unnatural, immoral, and the ultimate betrayal of the species.  They refuse to be anything other than human, regardless of what human means.  But as the years progress on earth, humanity seems to become something not really worth aspiring to, for no other reason than the fact that their existence is meaningless, and they know it.  At one point, Tate admits to Akin &quot;We don&#039;t get old. We don&#039;t have kids, and nothing we do means shit&quot; (402).  Eventually, the main characteristic associated with humanity becomes violence.  Men rape, pillage, kidnap and kill.  Even the more civilized members of Pheonix start using guns and resort to raiding other towns.&lt;br /&gt;
	The resisters hold so strongly to this moral imperative that they not only kill others, but allow themselves to die.  Many resisters with correctable medical conditions refuse Ooloi treatment, one of Akin&#039;s captors would &quot;cut his own throat before he let one of those things touch him again,&quot; even though they could cure him of the ulcer that kills him (328).  Since the Ooloi are so preoccupied with healing, they will, and biologically need to, treat anyone unwell they are presented with, and would therefore do so, even for a resister, yet none seek treatment.  They feel they must hold their moral ground, and this makes them suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;
At this point, their resistance just isn&#039;t worth it any more.  They may be avoiding betraying their species in their minds, but they&#039;re causing much more harm that the Oankali ever did, and for that reason, they&#039;re acting more immorally than Lilith or any of the other humans with Oankali mates.  Though clearly our biology tells us that it&#039;s absolutely immoral to allow the extinction of the species, if being human means raping and killing other humans, then trying to propagate the species is itself immoral.  Through this, I think Lilith&#039;s Brood shows that there are so such things as absolute morals.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>female objectification</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/100</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Atwood&#039;s The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is often described as a work of feminist literature there are no heroic, or even admirable female characters.  Instead, the cast of female characters serves as an inventory of all the ways a woman can fail in the context of oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
Serena Joy was an advocate for the return of &quot;family values,&quot; she campaigned for women to return to the domestic sphere.  If any woman should have wholeheartedly embraced the Republic of Gilead, it should have been her, but she is not happy.  Offred even wonders: &quot;Which of us is it worse for, her or me?&quot; (95). The only thing she seems to take pleasure in is abusing her power over the other women of the house.  She does have real power over them, particularly Offred, whom she can have sent to the colonies on a moment&#039;s notice.  She punishes Offred for stealing husband&#039;s attention even through the tiny practice of digging her rings into Offred&#039;s hands during the all-important &quot;ceremony.&quot;  Gilead causes makes her hypocritical and cruel.  Aunt Lydia did in fact wholeheartedly embrace the oppressive regime of the Republic of Gilead; she played an active part in its implementation and persistence as a matron of the reeducation centers. She goes beyond simply accepting the oppression, and actually adopts an oppressive role, and she relishes it: &quot;we, sitting in our rows, eyes down, we make her salivate morally.  We are hers to define&quot; (114).  Aunt Lydia is particularly repulsive in her active suppression of the &quot;right to&quot; for women, given that she herself is a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
Janine, a.k.a. Ofwarren, is similarly distasteful because of her apparent acceptance of her existence as a handmaid, even though this appearance is completely contrived.  Though in another context, we might forgive her behavior as a necessary evil for survival, here as readers it is incredibly difficult.  She supplicates herself at the feet of the regime.  She does so literally at the red center &quot;kneel[ing] at the front of the classroom, hands behind her backâ€¦ her red face and dripping nose&quot; and she admits, as to the cause of her rape at the age of 14 &quot;It was my own fault. I led them on. I deserved the pain&quot; (72).  Later, as a handmaid, she partakes in the bloodlust of the particicution.&lt;br /&gt;
Moira, at the beginning of the novel, is promising as a heroic female figure.  She escapes from the red center and becomes the handmaids&#039; &quot;fantasy&quot; (133).  Throughout her time at the Commander&#039;s house Offred fantasizes about the &quot;frisky&quot; Moira at large in the world, as a last remnant of the old world. We finally meet Moira again at Jezebels.  She is, in a certain sense, freer than Offred.  She can smoke, and drink, and have sex with women, she has face cream and drugs, she only works nights.  But she&#039;s not really free, she&#039;s a prostitute, but sells her body for only modest freedom.  She wasn&#039;t supposed to, as Offred says &quot;give in, go along, save her skin,&quot; we, like Offred want &quot;gallantry from her, swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; (249).  But even her spirit is broken.&lt;br /&gt;
The resistance of Ofwarren, our theoretical heroine, is potentially even more pathetic than that of the other women.  She&#039;s incredibly apathetic.  She spends more time making excuses than being angry.  She gives up resisting, to the point of being annoyed by Ofglen&#039;s plans for resistance, simply because of a small sexual outlet, in the form of Nick.  She, more than anyone else, has internalized her oppression.  This fact manifests itself in her descriptions of the world.  She illustrates the world around her in compulsive detail, her justification being that it keeps her mind from her oppression.  However, these descriptions show her obsession with the color red, it shows up more than any other color in her descriptions.  She describes the red of the blood-smile and the Serena Joy&#039;s tulips.  The smell of the flowers in the garden is red.  She comments on the dusk-rose velvet on the drapes in the commander&#039;s house and remembers the veiny redness of a leaf on the ground of the forest when she was captured.  For her, red is the color of her robe, representative of her definition as being functional purely on a biological level, representative of her adultery and shame.  That she should be so aware of it in her life shows how deeply she has internalized her shame.&lt;br /&gt;
Given that this novel is so often read as a work of feminist literature, clearly Atwood wasn&#039;t trying to show that women are weak or inferior to men.  Rather this pervasiveness of shame, and guilt, the fact that they all felt that they &quot;deserved it&quot; (177) goes to show just how debilitating subjugation can be.  An effective oppressive regime can cause even the freest of spirits to surrender if given a small chance for release within the system, whether that release is control over other women, uncertain sexual relief, or forbidden pleasures at a steep cost.  For this reason, the novel is just as humanist as it is feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>synesthesia</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/71</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, did anyone else notice the little bits of synesthesia that popped up throughout neuromancer?  There&#039;s an &quot;aching taste of blue&quot; on page 257, Molly&#039;s pain as &quot;neon worms in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill&quot; on 217.  I&#039;m pretty sure there was something else as well, but now I can&#039;t find it.  If its significant in any way, I&#039;m sure it has to do with the whole mind-body problem, but mostly its just a random observation.&lt;br /&gt;
Did anyone pick up on any others?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Would you keep your meat?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/70</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We talked a fair bit in class about the troubled mind-body relationship present in Neuromancer.  Many of the characters make us question our assumptions of what it means to be alive, from the unembodied mind of Wintermute to the mindless body of Armitage, with multiple characters straddling the line between life and death at any given point.  Case is the one character who we are really allowed to connect with on any psychological level (though even that hold is tenuous, given the somewhat schizophrenic style of postmodern/cyberpunk writing). But even Case challenges our idea of what it means to be human, and alive.&lt;br /&gt;
The question is raised most obviously through his disgust of &quot;flesh.&quot; The body as a prison is not a new concept by any means, but Case takes his dislike to a new level, perhaps because he, unlike us, can actually separate body and mind to a certain extent.   When he finally does get to plug his mind into the matrix he&#039;s ecstatic, laughing &quot;distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face,&quot; his nearly orgasmic euphoria caused by being able to escape into his mind, after being tethered for so long (52).  He doesn&#039;t even like simstim because it&#039;s a &quot;gratuitous multiplication of flesh input&quot; (55). But ironically for him, this purely mental exercise is still dependant on the body.  He is only able to jack in again after extensive surgery, and at the end of the book, in order to ensure that his talent won&#039;t be destroyed again, he has to physically venture into the Tessier-Ashpool &quot;hive&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
But the evils of meat follow him, even into the matrix.  In Neuromancer&#039;s island world &quot;[Linda] pulled him down, to the meat, the flesh the cowboys mocked.  It was a vast thing, beyond knowing, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite intricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever read&quot; (239).  Even in what he knew was a programmed fantasy the drive held.&lt;br /&gt;
But for all his obvious protests, I&#039;m not really sure that Case really does want to transcend the body.  Neuromancer explains to him in their final showdown, in the setting of the beach, &quot;[t]o live here is to live. There is no difference&quot; (258).  Given that this statement is said by the enemy at the climax at the novel, we&#039;re clearly not supposed to agree.  But if the body simply is a useless, debilitating casing, then really I don&#039;t see why Neuromancer should be wrong.  Life on the beach with Linda seems better than any point of Case&#039;s existence in the &quot;real&quot; world, at least over the course of the novel.  So then why not abandon the real world entirely?  Perhaps he can&#039;t because such a feat is impossible, but I think Case&#039;s experiences while flatlining suggest otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
When he flatlines, Case is officially brain dead.  There is no electrical activity, at all, in his &quot;flesh.&quot;  But his mind is still functional. The first time flatlines is also the first time he meets Wintermute.  He describes shooting a gun during the episode: &quot;the recoil almost broke his wrist. The muzzle-flash lit the office like a flashbulb. With his ears ringing, he started at the jagged hole in the front of the desk. Explosive bullet. Azide&quot; (119).  That specific passage involves at least three sense, and the description is just as real as any other in the book.  The same goes for his time on the beach.  What gives the situation away as a sham is not fuzzy outlines to objects, or constant static ringing in his ears, but rather the overly convenient food packets.  These experiences feel just as real as any other to Case. He could live a potentially fulfilling life in cyberspace even after his physical brain is dead, so far as we can tell.  But he refuses to accept this fate.&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though parts of Neuromancer seem to praise the mind over body, exalt in the triumph of brain over brawn.  I think it represents an inherent fear of ever divorcing one from the other.  We cannot be truly human without both.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/53</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, this novel seems to extol the virtue of the military.  All of the characters who we are supposed to respect do at some point come to the conclusion that all real men are military men, that it makes sense that one can only be a citizen after completing a term of service.  Dubois believes this from the beginning.  He drills the idea of the importance of civic duty, and of violence into his students during History and Moral Philosophy: &quot;breeds that forget this basic truth [that violence settles most anything] have always paid for it with their lives and freedom&quot; (27). Even Rico&#039;s father, initially the most vocal anti-military character in the book comes to the realization that before the war he had been simply a &quot;producing-consuming economic animalâ€¦&quot; but, by joining the army, he was going to become a man (180).  The M.I. are portrayed as the best military outfit the world&#039;s ever seen: impeccably trained, highly efficient, and passionate.  Such traits are admirable in any context, one doesn&#039;t need to approve of military training to be impressed by their performance.  As an opponent of war, I am not typically moved by romanticized portrayals of military life.  But I was impressed by Rico&#039;s description of life as a member of Rasczak&#039;s Roughnecks.  He says, &quot;they didn&#039;t wear [the skulls] because, in Rasczack&#039;s Roughnecks, it didn&#039;t matter in the least how many combat drops you had made, nor which ones; you were either a Roughneck or you weren&#039;t--and if you were not, they didn&#039;t care who you were&quot; (147).  The fraternity he describes in the passage actually appealed to me (though it is noteworthy that this is a fraternity in a fairly literal sense: no women allowed).  That even I can be made to respect, and even approve of, this army certainly seems to imply that this book glorifies of the ideals of a military class.  However, there are ways that Rico acts which suggest that the military is not as glamorous as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico mentions on multiple occasions how proud he is to be a part of the Mobile Infantry.  &quot;We&#039;re all volunteers;&quot; he says, &quot;we&#039;re M.I. because we want to be, we&#039;re proud to be M.I. and the M.I. is proud of us.  If a man doesn&#039;t feel that way about it, from his callused feet to his hairy ears, I don&#039;t want him on my flank when trouble starts&quot; (115).  Though this is all fine and well, Rico seems to have forgotten that he&#039;s not M.I. because he wanted to be.  He didn&#039;t even make the conscious choice to enlist at all.  When he tells Carmen he&#039;s going to enlist he admits: &quot;I hadn&#039;t made any decision; my mouth was leading its own life&quot; (29).  But even once enlisted, M.I. wasn&#039;t his first choice, it was his last.  He&#039;s only an M.I. because he flunked the test for every other military position.  I found the fact that he ignores his real motives for joining the M.I. (desire to impress a girl, an inability to perform any other function), or perhaps has forgotten them completely, slightly disconcerting.  Similarly strange is when he &quot;goes career&quot; on a whim, giving it about as much thought as he did his decision to enlist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found more shocking was just how desensitized to violence Rico becomes as the novel progresses.  He describes the difficulties involved in training in the Rockies, how tricky it is to navigate mountains in the powered suits, and to drive the point home he explains &quot;we had three major casualties in suit practice in broken country, two dead and one medical retirement&quot; (129).  And then he moves on, describes climbing the mountains without a suit.  There&#039;s no emotion attached to these deaths, they&#039;re just numbers.  Again, at the end of training: &quot;we graduated 187--of the others, fourteen were dead (one executed and his name struck) and the rest resigned&quot; (136).  These deaths are statistics, nothing else.  At one point, he divides attrition into two categories, casualties and &quot;refusal to enter capsule,&quot; all lumped together, equally remarkable (135).  The fact that some people refused to drop is actually discussed more.  And it&#039;s not the case that Rico was always insensitive to violence, he fainted at the beginning of training, partway through a flogging of a fellow officer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can argue that Rico&#039;s split second decision to join the military, and then to devote his life to the service goes to show that in his heart he knew it was the right thing to do; as he learned in History and Moral Philosophy, civic duty simply is the epitome of responsibility.  Furthermore his conversion to the cult of the M.I. possibly evidences that the M.I. really are just an incredible group of individuals.  And his ability to stay cool in the face of death is perhaps simply proof of the competence of the M.I.  But to my mind, it&#039;s hard not to see these as evidence that the military is not all good, as the medical man implies as he examines Rico, service changes men for the worse.  Though clearly it would be difficult to argue that Starship Troopers is actually advocating the dissolution of the military, does the novel actually portray armed forces as perhaps less than ideal?&lt;/p&gt;
