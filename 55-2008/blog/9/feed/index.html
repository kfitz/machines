 <title>mythologizing SF in o&amp;c</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/355</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The author of an article I read for my term paper writes that SF and myths operate similarly.  Both are a reflection of man&#039;s thirst for knowledge about his origins and his fate; SF is considered a more self-conscious form of myth-making.  This is especially prevalent in Oryx &amp;amp; Crake, during those instances when the Children of Crake ask Snowman to tell them creation stories.  Oryx and Crake are likened to Godlike beings: &quot;Crake made the bones of the Children of Crake out of the coral on the beach, and then he made their flesh out of a mango.  But the Children of Oryx hatched out of an egg, a giant egg laid by Oryx herself&quot; (96).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowman, in this story, represents the last remnants of mankind, though at times, he loses sense of who and what he is/was.  I thought it was interesting that the female Children of Crake were disturbing to Snowman.  &quot;They&#039;re every known colour from deepest black to whitest white...each one of them is admirably proportioned.  Each is sound of tooth, smooth of skin.  No ripples of fat around their waists, no bulges, no dimpled orange-skin cellulite on their thighs...They look like retouched fashion photos&quot; (100).  In other words, these women are &quot;perfect.&quot;  Despite their perfection, Snowman does not find them sexually attractive.  As cliche as this may be, flaws individualize people and make them special; imperfection gives more personality to a face than perfect symmetry does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These women are too perfect.  &quot;These new women are neither lopsided nor sad: they&#039;re placid, like animated statues&quot; (100).  The Children of Crake are too well created for this post-apocalyptic environment.  They may look human, but they aren&#039;t human.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition: brands</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/323</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a lot of different ways, Pattern Recognition reminds me of some postmodern books I&#039;ve read, especially Infinite Jest.  IJ also exhibits signs of our society&#039;s preoccupation with brands (Large corporations advertise by sponsoring/subsidizing a year.  For example, &quot;Year of Dairy Products from the American Heartland.&quot;)  Also, during the discussion of Slow River, conspicuous consumption.  These are themes that also pop up in PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is set in the futuristic present, which is definitely preoccupied with labels, brands, and name-dropping.  Gibson casually references DKNY, Michelin, Louis Vuitton, and others.  The brands he mentions are brands from all over the world, and this emphasizes the ongoing globalization of a mass market.  The signs of this are everywhere.  Damien&#039;s flat has German and Italian appliances; Cayce has German locks installed; the coffee is from Colombia.  This is different from the concept of England as a &quot;mirror-world.&#039;&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;mirror-world,&quot; everything is slightly familiar and recognizable, yet different.  It is a foreign atmosphere with new species of brands to be wary of.  (Additionally, Cayce is thrown out of her element because she is unaccustomed to the British lifestyle: people drive on the opposite side of the road, the food looks and tastes different, etc.)  England&#039;s difference is attributed to the fact that its products are made and assembled within its borders.  &quot;They invented that here, probably, and made it here.  This was an industrial nation.  Buy a pair of scissors, you got British scissors.  They made all their own stuff.  Kept imports expensive...All their bits and pieces were different, from the ground up&quot; (108).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With outsourcing and such, products that are recognizably American are actually made in a different country.  As Boone Chu mentions, &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be that way much longer.  Not if the world&#039;s Bigends keep at it: no borders, pretty soon there&#039;s no mirror to be on the other side of&quot; (108). Cayce&#039;s beloved Buzz Rickson&#039;s, for example, are the Japanese reproduction of classic American WWII leather jackets.  &quot;It is an imitation more real somehow than that which it emulates&quot; (11).   What does this imply about the future of culture?  How will we be able to distinguish what is &quot;us&quot; and what is the &quot;other&quot; if the &quot;other&quot; is more &quot;us&quot; than we are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;
Since I&#039;m currently working on a paper for lit theory, Pattern Recognition also made me think of Cleanth Brooks and Roland Barthes, especially after the conversation in class about the author&#039;s intent.&lt;br /&gt;
The global fascination with the film clips is reminiscent of &quot;The Entertainment&quot; in Infinite Jest.&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s incredibly ironic that Cayce has this strange allergic reaction to brands, yet Bigend wants her to help him ultimately monetize the Footage, essentially making it into a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ghost in the shell</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/269</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my roommate about our scifi class and this obsession with information (like those tapes from Cyteen) and the Metaverse from Snow Crash, and she brought up this anime movie called &quot;Ghost in the Shell.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a clip from youtube.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=txXeLt1ECwI&amp;amp;feature=related&quot; title=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=txXeLt1ECwI&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;http://youtube.com/watch?v=txXeLt1ECwI&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else ever seen this?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>thoughts on reality video games, the metaverse...y mas</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/268</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reality tv shows have become more popularized these last few years.  Despite the fact that they&#039;re not intellectually stimulating, don&#039;t have a plot, and are probably not even completely &quot;reality,&quot; people love them!  Reading about the Metaverse made me think about Second Life, which interestingly enough, was modeled after the Metaverse in Snow Crash.  Just like reality shows seem to dominate television these days, games like the Sims entertain by trying to recreate ordinary everyday activities.  I personally don&#039;t understand how this can be interesting; what is the goal of this &quot;game&quot;?  It doesn&#039;t have an end goal, unlike traditional video games.  There is no competition because there are no winners or losers.  If there&#039;s no competition and no purpose, where is the thrill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in Snow Crash, when Hiro still has his job as &quot;The Deliverator,&quot; he claims to like that job because of the life-or-death, &quot;life on the line,&quot; fight or flight adrenaline it induces.  &quot;It&#039;s like being a kamikaze pilot.  Your mind is clear&quot; (5).  Unlike that monotonous cubicle job that he could have as a programmer working for a large corporation, it&#039;s exciting because there is a goal.  Make that delivery in 30 minutes or under, or you&#039;re toast.  Quite literally.  (Isn&#039;t it hilarious that the Mafia is in the pizza delivering industry?  How fitting...) He&#039;s trying to set a PR every time someone orders a pizza.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Life in America&quot; is steeped in meaningless jobs.  Hiro observes that &quot;people just rely on plain old competition...CosaNostra Pizza doesn&#039;t have any competition.  Competition goes against the Mafia ethic&quot; (5).  This corporate version of competition is denigrated.  Interoffice, intraoffice politics, and such rely on competition to generate more success, much in the same vein as the technological advancements that came out of the Cold War: who can do it better?  It&#039;s a &quot;rat race&quot; (5).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro thinks that competition eliminates self-motivation.  &quot;Life in America&quot; has strayed far from the Protestant work ethic that helped capitalism evolve.  There is no innate desire to work hard for moral or familial obligations.  That&#039;s why Hiro likes a job that forces him to operate to the best of his abilities.  &quot;You don&#039;t work harder because you&#039;re competing against some identical operation down the street.  You work harder because everything is on the line. Your name, your honor, your family, your life&quot; (5).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>power, knowledge, and self/identity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/241</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In many of the novels we&#039;ve read for this class, information and knowledge have been closely tied to technology and/or power.  The collection and accumulation of information and its practical applications demonstrate and enforce control.  With all of this focus on bettering one&#039;s social and financial status through useful knowledge, what happens to the individual?  In Slow River, as we discussed in class on Monday, Lore has identity issues (illustrated through parallel narratives, different point of views, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in childhood, Lore learned something important: &quot;...at seven Lore is suddenly realizing she can make of herself what she wills.  When she is old enough she can have red hair or golden eyebrows...And no one will tell her she is wrong, because no one will know.  She could become anyone she wishes.  But how will she know she is still herself?&quot; (52).  Even at such a young age, Lore recognizes the implications of knowledge as power over others.  If no one knows what she is supposed to be, then they cannot question what identity she portrays.  At the beginning of the novel, for example, Lore is uncomfortable when she realizes Spanner  knows &quot;all about her&quot; (18).  No PIDA can change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progenies of the social elite are expected to maintain certain standards, whether those standards are on the physical or intellectual scale.  Roles and identities are laid out for them.  Lore, then, is the product of this environment (and a dysfunctional family, but that&#039;s a different matter).  Not only does she have &quot;all the visible trappings of the rich and powerful&quot; (52), but she also has the knowledge that comes with managing her family&#039;s corporation.  In trying to meet all these social and familial expectations, Lore ultimately jeopardizes herself.  Even under the guise of Sal Bird, Lore must also meet a different set of expectations (though it is because her knowledge exceeds these expectations that she is able to help the water plant).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time Lore spends away from her family ultimately enables her take control of her own life.  &quot;Self-actualization,&quot; according to Thoreau, requires a rejection of material goods, which Lore definitely accomplishes when she expresses her desire to stay with Spanner instead of going home.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article we read, the author questions Lore&#039;s supposed progression throughout the novel.  Is her development truly progressive?  Even though it may seem regressive because she returns to her family, I don&#039;t think that everything she went through should be discredited.  While I agree that her character seems to fall flat at the end, I think that, in the beginning of the novel at least, there seems to be hope for her internal development.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>there is a fine line...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/167</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting oxymoronic concepts in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  Throughout the series, the Oankali mention that the Human race is full of life and death, horror and beauty.  Simultaneously, Lilith notices the subtle ways the Oankali treat the Humans.  Their imprisonment isn&#039;t actively aggressive, but it&#039;s an aggressiveness hidden in kindness.  &quot;And they had done it all so softly, without brutality, and with patience and gentleness so corrosive...&quot; (67).  Also, when the ooloi and the humans are fighting, Lilith describes it as &quot;gentle chaos.&quot;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trend I noticed is the fascination with pleasure and pain.  The ooiloi definitely have an interest in both pleasure and pain, and Lilith, also, &quot;perversely&quot; enjoys the pain of aching muscles (146).  When Nikanj induces &quot;time together&quot; between Lilith and Joseph, it is both a painful and pleasurable experience.  &quot;Now their delight in one another ignited and burned...They seemed to rush upward...&quot; (162).  This experience is soon followed by pain: &quot;Her first solitary sensation was pain--as though she had been shouting, screaming&quot; (162-163).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, I guess there&#039;s just a fine line between all these things, which could be an extension of the moral ambiguity we&#039;ve been having trouble understanding.  How much of the Oankali&#039;s intentions are for the benefit of their race or ours?  Is their philanthropy completely altruistic? We don&#039;t get to know what the Oankali really think, which is part of the problem.  Either way, I&#039;m still wishy washy on what I think.  However, Nikanj&#039;s statement on page 153 really captured my attention: &quot;We...do need you...In a very real way, you&#039;ve captured us, and we can&#039;t escape.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>this was meant to be a respone...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;...This was meant to be a response to the long thread of comments on the entry titled, &quot;The extension of human masculinity,&quot; but it became this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to watch people get so riled up about gender in class.  I understand that some people believe it&#039;s a social construct and that stereotypes are evil, etc. etc., but I think that this belief in gender and the stereotypes attached to each one is so deeply ingrained, that there&#039;s no point in arguing aimlessly about it.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m maybe not going to make any sense when I try to explain this, but I&#039;m going to try... So in my Lit Theory class today (or yesterday, technically speaking), we were discussing Nietsche&#039;s and Frost&#039;s ideas on metaphors.  Metaphors are so common in our everyday language that we don&#039;t even notice them anymore (ie. &quot;She&#039;s a warm person.&quot;  Life as a journey can be extended to the statement &quot;I&#039;m lost.&quot;).  Ultimately, metaphors stabilize and give meaning to our perceptions by helping us understand things in relation to other ones.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Left Hand of Darkness and Lilith&#039;s Brood, the metaphors are the references to gender that the authors make.  Here&#039;s one to refresh your memory: &quot;Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit&quot;(LeGuin 12)&lt;br /&gt;
While I do not doubt that authors like Butler and LeGuin may be trying to provoke us with these gendered non-gender beings, maybe they&#039;re also just providing supposedly male, or supposedly female attributes, so that WE, as readers, can engage in and better understand (and maybe even empathize with?) these aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ekumen and Religion?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/134</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Warning: I am feverish and have induced a headache from a superfluous amount of coughing, so I apologize if this entry is kind of wonky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first was reading The Left Hand of Darkness, I didn&#039;t really give the word/concept of &quot;Ekumen&quot; much thought.  A little bit later in the book, however, a derivation of the word was given as &quot;Ekumenical.&quot;  This jumped out at me and reminded me of the word, &quot;ecumenical,&quot; for which I (courtsey of OED) will provide a definition: belonging to or representing the whole (Christian) world; general; universal, Catholic; belonging to the whole world; universal, general, world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Ursula Le Guin is an atheist, I believe that the portrayal and role of the Ekumen as the Catholic Church is one that is subject to criticism or satire.  The narrow-mindedness of Catholicism is represented through the narrow-mindedness of the Ekumen&#039;s envoy, Genly Ai, who cannot quite grasp the lack of opposites on Winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ekumen, according to Genly, seeks &quot;the enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God&quot; (34).  I thought it really sounded like the Catholic Church when, on 136, he explains that the Ekumen is not a government, though it may share some similarities to one: &quot;It is an attempt to reunify the mystical with the political, and as such is of course mostly a failure; but its failure has done more good for humanity so far...It is a society and it has, at least potentially, a culture.  It is a form of education...it&#039;s a sort of a very large school...in another aspect it&#039;s a league or union...possessing some degree of centralized conventional organization.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the impression that the Ekumen is preoccupied with progress.  It is very much concerned with economical profits and gains, and only invites worlds to join if they are sufficiently enlightened or open to enlightenment (both religion-wise and technologically).  While some aspects of the Gethenien world are antiquated (Karhide is described as being  in a &quot;dark age&quot; [115]), others are not.  Orgoreyn is more industrialized, with standardized clothing.  Genly observes that &quot;This, now, looked like a country ready to enter Ekumenical age&quot; (115).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s interesting that in Christianity, it is God who created binaries.  He first made Adam, then Eve, a female counterpart.  Everything comes in opposites and in pairs.  The ambisexual/ambigender? inhabitants of Winter are supposedly the result of some experiment conducted by previous colonists.  This dualism and subsequent lack of binaries, though created by humans, seems to be better (in some respects) than the world created by God (no rape, no war, everyone gets pregnancy leave from work....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the random bits of Gethenien folklore or mythology, I felt, read like stories from the Bible.  With the story about the Therems and the ending of the book, I got the impression that Estraven was kind of like the prodigal son.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thing I thought was interesting: The drink called &quot;lifewater&quot;...I don&#039;t know if LeGuin knows this, but &quot;whiskey&quot; (uisge beatha) in Scottish Gaelic translates as &quot;water of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Deuteronomy 22:23-29</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/98</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Context: On pgs. 278-280, a Guardian is convicted of rape and subsequently punished.  Aunt Lydia says that the &quot;&#039;penalty for rape...is death.  Deuteronomy 22:23-29...one woman was pregnant and the baby died&#039;&quot; (179).&lt;br /&gt;
Consistent with the other Biblical references in the novel, Deuteronomy 22:23-29 is conveniently condensed to serve the purpose Aunt Lydia wants it to serve.  (see below) The convicted Guardian tries to say something, but all he can get out is &quot;&#039;I didn&#039;t...&#039;&quot; (279).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bloodlust that ensues is alarming.  Someone else blogged about the colors red and blue (I didn&#039;t read the full blog entry yet, so sorry if this repeats anything), and this passage definitely has a lot of red imagery in it. The women swarm forward like an angry red tide and proceed to viciously beat the man.   This act of violence is easy to commit because they have dehumanized the Guardian; he&#039;s likened to a &quot;half-dead rat&quot; (279) and &quot;He has become an it&quot; (280).  Ironically, the Handmaids have also become beasts.  Offred admits that there is an urge to &quot;tear, gouge, rend&quot; (279), flare nostrils, and growl.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident reminded me a lot of Heart of Darkness: the Africans were thought of as animals; but in treating the Africans so cruelly, the white explorers dehumanized themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guys were wondering what that section of Deuteronomy says, according to the Bible (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibleresources.bible.com&quot; title=&quot;www.bibleresources.bible.com&quot;&gt;www.bibleresources.bible.com&lt;/a&gt;, King James version):   23If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 24Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour&#039;s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.  25But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel&#039;s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>thoughts on HT</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/83</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is different from the other two books we&#039;ve read thus far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the worlds of ST and Neuromancer, there are still other ethnicities/races.  In HT, however, I didn&#039;t catch any inferences to characters who were not Caucasian. Gilead is a dysfunctional utopia.  The premise of Atwood&#039;s novel is scary and realistic enough: the idea that women, because of an increasingly toxic environment (mm especially since L.A. has been really smoggy lately), are becoming more and more infertile and incapable of carrying a fetus to full term.  The notion that this near-future society has reverted to a simpler way of life, while maintaining certain technologies is also an interesting concept.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m glad that Atwood gives the readers insight on the underground dealings in this world.  Unlike Neuromancer, it is not the scummy drug addicts who comprise the subculture; rather, it is those who are in charge and supposed to be great religious, rule-abiding citizens (mmm this sounds pretty familiar....Mark Foley, anyone?).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&#039;ve questioned the roles of females and males in ST and Neuromancer, in HT they are very much set in stone.  I think it&#039;s particularly interesting that in a world where fertility and procreation have become such an issue, the females are the ones who must submit to a patriarchal society.  Biologically speaking, women are more valuable than men (eggs are harder to come by than sperm, etc); if there are problems with impregnating a woman, in Gilead, it&#039;s never the man&#039;s fault.  Furthermore, when we discussed Neuromancer in class on Wednesday, someone had mentioned that it seemed as though the female body is revered as something beautiful, whereas the male body (ie Case) is this pale, hairy feeble body curled into the fetal position.  The Commander doesn&#039;t sound any better, with &quot;his white, tufted raw body&quot; (95).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional note, especially to people who have read Pynchon&#039;s Gravity&#039;s Rainbow:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;There is something powerful in the whispering of obscenities, about those in power.  There&#039;s something delightful about it, something naughty, secretive, forbidden, thrilling.  It&#039;s like a spell, of sorts.  It deflates them, reduces them to the common denominator where they can be dealt with&quot; (222).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did that remind anyone else of Slothrop&#039;s use of obscenities in GR?  I actually have the quote it reminds me of (is that nerdy of me?)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;           &quot;&#039;Fuck you,&#039; whispers Slothrop.  It&#039;s the only spell he knows, and a                     pretty good all-purpose one at thatâ€¦Maybe he&#039;ll sneak in tonight--no not at night--but sometime, with a bucket and brush, paint FUCK YOUâ€¦&#039;&quot; (Pynchon 206)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Asian Persuasian</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/67</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly&#039;s long nails: In class on Monday when we discussed Molly, there was a comment made that long nails in America have this stigma of impracticality, and that Molly&#039;s nails are useful.  When I thought about her nails, especially in relation to Asian culture, I pictured instead those sharp metal nails (I wish I knew what they were called) that Chinese women used to wear on their fingers.  They were typically worn on the pinkie and ring fingers, and while I do not know what they were used for (ornamentation, probably), in Chinese shows or movies, sometimes an angry aristocratic woman will use them to viciously scratch someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I thought it was really interesting that Molly had surgery on her eyes.  I don&#039;t know if this was common back when Gibson wrote Neuromancer, but nowadays, surgery is not uncommon among Asian women (Japanese, Koreans and Chinese).  Many undergo plastic surgery to get larger &quot;double eyelids&quot; (an effort to assimilate with Western culture...?  Japanese magazines even have tips on how to apply makeup so that Asian eyes will look more like Caucasian ones).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Who else thinks Molly is a J.A.M.F.?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>beta male uprising</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/54</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just an entry in response to some of the comments made in class today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting that the new machismo in Neuromancer could be conveyed through &quot;non-badassness.&quot;  When we discussed ST last week, someone had brought up the fact that Johnny was feminized through his relationship with Flores (additionally, the movie version of Dizzy was also a very masculine female).  I thought that the relationship between Molly and Case was similar in the gender role reversal vein.  Molly is the brawn and Case is the brain (mind/body relationship?).  Furthermore, in conjunction with the Huntington article, Case is the atypical masculine hero in that &quot;Heroic and skillful action for Case takes place a the computer keyboard&quot; (137) rather than through sheer &quot;extraordinary athleticism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Responses to class discussions</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/23</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone in class on Monday had mentioned that in the MI, humans are the (vessel for) technology.  I think this is an interesting point, especially in conjunction with the developments of our current military.  The United States Army has been implementing robots in the Middle East to prevent unnecessary casualties.  Soldiers can now direct these robots, which can detect and disable mines and have the capability of firing back at any hostiles, with remote controls from a safe distance away.  There remains that element of human judgment, although in a much more diluted form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I had contemplated applying to West Point or joining RoTC; as for the use of this book by the various military academies in the United States, which was brought up in class, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scary thing.  Starship Troopers stresses loyalty to the government and to protection of the general population, as well as the concept of &quot;leave no man behind.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this book justifies violence in a way that makes sense (I&#039;m not saying I advocate it) and would mitigate the dissent of people who are against American troops in Iraq (namely those who harass soldiers or marines about &quot;supporting the war&quot;).  I pulled this particular quote because it reminded me of another quote (Was it Alfred Lord Tennyson who wrote &quot;Ours is not to reason why.  Ours is but to do or die.&quot;?): &quot;The purpose of war is to support your government&#039;s decisions by force...Not killing..but controlled and purposeful violence.  But it&#039;s not your business or mine to decide the purpose of the control.  It&#039;s never a soldier&#039;s business to decide when or where or how--or why--he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals...&quot; (63).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had watched the movie long before ever reading this book and I can remember my initial thoughts: Wow this movie must have been a low budget film.  After reading ST and re-watching the adaptation, I also noted that: 1]It&#039;s strange that most of the characters look/are white, but have retained their more &quot;ethnic&quot; names 2]Dizzy Flores is a female and 3]Women are allowed in the MI for the sake of gratuitous female nudity...?&lt;/p&gt;
