 <title>There&#039;s some literary word for this writing style, but I forget what it was</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/298</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Midnight Robber is a novel set apart from most other works of science fiction in its use of a non-Anglo-Saxon culture as the predominant society of its world.  Science Fiction often deals with issues of individuals set apart from the rest of society or set in unfamiliar surroundings, trying to find their way, and so it is somewhat surprising that there are so few examples of Science fiction works written through the lenses of cultures outside of the western/American norm.  Nalo Hopkinson presents a future in which Carribean culture and influence dominates, built through her use of Creole narration and mythologies that depart from westernized norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most conspicuous representation of the novel&#039;s Carribian viewpoint is the use of Creole Language by characters and the Narrative.  The very intro of the book begins with some text describing the main character that, at first glance, might be confused for improper grammar, or just seem incomprehensible for a long while:  &quot;The only thing soft about Tan-Tan is she big, molasses-brown eyes that could look on you, and your heart would start to beat time boopaloops with every flutter of she long eyelashes.  One look in she eyes, and you fall for she already,&quot; (1-2).  Once a reader comes to understanding the grammar structures and wording methodologies a bit better, though, the text becomes almost as easy to read as regular English prose, but gives the added cultural element to keep the reader immersed in the story.  The character dialogues are similarly presented in Creole, keeping the image that the entire world, not just our main character, is based upon Carribean culture rather than western societal constructs.  One exchange goes as follows: &quot; &#039;I not leaving you!&#039; &#039;She not going anywhere with you, you pissant wretch!&#039; &#039;Go, Melonhead, or it just go be worse!&#039; &#039;You sure?&#039; &#039;Yes! I go come talk to you later,&#039; &quot; (166).  As previously mentioned, this at first glance appears to be bad grammar, but gives an authenticity otherwise completely lost by correcting the speech patterns of Creole pidgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkinson further involves Creole by using mythologies based in the realm of the novel and its Carribean roots.  The majority of tales involve trickery, or &quot;anansi story&quot; as it is called in the introduction, referring to an African legend of Anansi the Spider, a great being who greatly helped out mankind but also was a trickster.  In the tale of Tan-Tan and Dry Bone, the entire plot is centered around the two characters trying to out-trick each other to get their way; In Dry Bone&#039;s case to be perpetually cared for by Tan-Tan, and Tan-Tan trying to get rid of him.  Tan-Tan finally wins out by tricking Dry Bones to going out onto her porch by weaving an image of a veranda suited for a king, playing to his ego to bring about his downfall at the hands of Master Johncrow, who takes Dry Bone away into the sky (211).  While Western myths deal with trickery, the Carribean and African influenced myths present in the story seem almost entirely comprised of subterfuge as a means to all ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midnight Robber&#039;s basis in Carribean and African culture allow for a more immersive reading experience, and help to create a realm that is, sadly, more alien than most standard works of science fiction which are based on western culture.  By taking readers into this other culture, she can create a fictitious world with so many real world elements, yet still have it be alien and unique.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So I wrote about race.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/267</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Race and racial discrimination are a very large part of Neal Stephenson&#039;s Snow Crash, but they do not manifest in the way we would expect.  In Stephenson&#039;s future world, race becomes defined more by who you work for rather than what your genetics are.  Residents and employees of the various Franchises are granted a sense of exclusive community as per their &quot;citizenship,&quot; and come to distrust and even feud with those from other Franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is genetically half African, half Japanese, and the people he deals with on a regular basis are just as culturally diverse.  Hiro&#039;s very roommate, Vitaly Chernobyl, comes from a very different background:  &quot;Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex-Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev,&quot; (104).  Japanese and Russians have never been on very friendly terms, and I have no idea of the contact levels between Russians and Africans, but I don&#039;t imagine they are long time allies.  Yet the two can get along perfectly fine.  Similarly, Italians and Hiro, Chinese and Japanese, and other individual interracial relationships occur without problem.  This is because racial divisions have moved from original ethnicity to gained citizenship within franchulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most predominant franchise in the novel is The Mafia, an organization unchanged from reality to novel in its power structure.  The Mafia is a very welcoming organization to the individual, evidenced by their advertisements, which portray the head of the franchise, Uncle Enzo, with &quot;his arm around the shoulders of a young wholesome-looking black kid,&quot; or another that says: &quot;NO WAY, JOSÃ‰! Uncle Enzo holding up one hand to stop an Uzi-toting Hispanic scumbag; behind him stands a pan-ethnic phalanx of kids and grannies, resolutely gripping baseball bats and frying pans,&quot; (146).  But when it comes to inter-franchulate relations, the Mafia, like most other franchulates, is not particularly fond of the opposition.  &quot;Most of the franchises are yellow-logoed, wrong-side-of-the-tracks operations like Uptown, Narcolobia, Caymans Plus, Metazania, and The Clink.  But standing out like rocky islands in this swamp are the Nova Sicilia franchulates â€“ beachheads for the Mafia&#039;s effort to outduel the overwhelmingly strong Narcolobia,&quot; (145).  Sure, they could be called rival companies, but their power and operations extend way beyond that of what one would consider corporate.  Franchises even have passports, making them even more like a country than a business:  &quot;They don&#039;t want to let him in.  He flashes his passport; the doors openâ€¦ Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong is an open country, always looking for new citizens, even if they are the poorest Refus,&quot; (328).  Alliances are even formed between them, as the Mafia and Mr. Lee&#039;s people get together in an attempt to overthrow another superpower, L. Bob Rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation of Ethnicity from a biologically determined factor to an issue of allegiances and subscription is an interesting proposition by Stephenson.  People are learning to classify less along genetic lineage and be less racist I feel, but the idea that something will arise to replace this is a frightening idea.  Stephenson seems to be hinting at ingrained structures of hate and rivalry, which are hard to deny, especially when examining our past as a species, but to say that our future just holds more of the same is a rather pessimistic view, and one I hope does not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tank Girl was a trip, but this is my response to Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/231</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In Slow River, we are presented with a protagonist who is rarely who she says she is, yet always remains herself.  Frances Lorien van de Oest is the kidnapped heir to a multi-billion dollar company working as a grunt in a sanitation plant for little pay.  Nicola Griffith uses Slow River to present Identity as a two-fold concept, where one is defined by a legal classification, yet also by the set of morals and experiences they carry with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most pressing and recognized identity is of course the legal identity.  Present in the form of PIDAs, they are microcapsules implanted into the crook of the thumb and forefinger that are scanned for economic transactions, and detail the owner much in the same way as a license.  When Lore gains her new identity, she is given all the details with the PIDA: &quot;Bird, Sal.  Female.  Caucasian.  Blood type A positive.  DOBâ€¦ Twenty-fiveâ€¦The tiny black PIDA was in a sealed bag withâ€¦ a plaskin pouch the size of a pink cockroach.  Frozen blood for DNA tests,&quot; (21).  When Lore was still part of the van de Oest family, she had her own PIDA rather than that of a dead woman, and when kidnapped, the first thing to go was this legal identity.    By removing her PIDA, her kidnappers create a legal nobody, making it impossible for her to prove her identity on her own or access her family&#039;s resources.  Lore becomes a nobody, but at the same time can now be anybody simply by obtaining false temporary PIDAS, giving her a new sense for the world and for what an identity is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her reactions to experiences with Spanner of switching identities through various PIDAs, Lore shows her true inner identity, and comes to realize it is an inescapable, defining part of her.  While working as Sal Bird at the Hedon Road Plant, Lore is supposed to know little more than the most basic of procedures and functionings of the facility.  Yet when she recognizes issues with the operation, she can&#039;t help but remember things from her van de Oest past.  Magyar, her supervisor, tells her that the bacteria in the plant need to always be at 27.3oC, never anywhere else, yet Lore recognizes and almost speaks out to tell her, &quot;For a denitrification-nitrification process, heterotrophic facultative bacteria were usually comfortable anywhere between twenty-five and thirty degrees,&quot; but realizes in time that this is something Sal Bird would have no conception of (47).  In addition to the knowledge, though, Lore also retains some of her superiority complexes, as shown when she discovers that her family&#039;s nutrient products have been substituted with generics.   While the bacteria are most likely completely capable of surviving and functioning with the nutrients provided by the generic brand, Lore feels that the lives of millions of people are being put at grievous, unnecessary risk.  Yet the plant functions fine until an occurrence of deliberate sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lore&#039;s experiences through the novel help her to realize that there are two levels to identity.  The surface level that most people see is the legal and falsifiable persona, but the deeper, moral identity is something that cannot be recreated and invented so easily, as it is an accumulation of knowledge and experiences.  The two together serve to act as the real, present self, and at the end of the novel, Lore recognizes that finally she &quot;would be nobody but the Lore [she] had made,&quot; (343).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Xenophobia on an interstellar scale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/185</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the works we have read so far, the series Lilith&#039;s Brood reminds me most of other science fiction books I&#039;ve read.  It has several things I feel to be typical staples of the SciFi genre, parts that are most often shared with other novels in the category.  These include the presence of an intrusive alien species, some great war that leaves our current perception of Earth in ruin, and advancement of human life and health through some means.  The most noticeable and most pertinent theme, though, is that of Xenophobia, one I feel plays out most often in science fiction books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler makes no attempts to hide the xenophobic tendencies of humankind in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  As we see with Lilith, the protagonist of the first book DAWN, after centuries of suspended animation interspersed with brief periods of isolated wakefulness is very quick to welcome the presence of a human being into her chamber.  She soon discovers that her companion is not, in fact human, and recoils away from him, noting that &quot;she did not want to be any closer to him.  She had not known what held her back before.  Now she was certain it was his alienness, his difference, his literal unearthliness,&quot; (13).  Lilith is African, a race most typically victim of xenophobic tendencies.  Yet even she finds the though of an alien being with humanoid but not completely human features to be utterly repulsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict is partly a superficial one, based upon the appearances of the Oankali.  They have humanoid, bipedal forms, but instead of eyes, ears, or noses, they have sensory tentacles covering much of their body, giving them the appearance of medusae.  Lilith even comments to Tate, the first person she awakens, that &quot;Oankali are ugly.  Grotesque.  But we can get used to them, and they won&#039;t hurt us.  Remember that,&quot; (131).  In other words, the Oankali&#039;s appearance is definitely a startling and scary point that drives humans away from them, but this is not all that is wrong, as it is possible for humans to adapt to their looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another human, Gilbert Roybal, reveals the true sentiment concerning the humans distaste for the looks of the Oankali Constructs and their sensory tentacles: &quot;It&#039;s not just the way the tentacles lookâ€¦. Yes, they are ugly, but it&#039;s what they represent that&#039;s important.  They&#039;re alien.  Un-Human.  How can little girls grow up to be Human women when their own sense organs betray them?&quot; (391).  The whole conflict is really about the fact that the constructs and Oankali are a whole different species apart from Homo sapiens, xenophobia on an intergalactic scale.  After all, there are tentacled beings on earth, but these are not as capable of intelligent thought as we are.  Yet the Oankali defy this norm, and other customs and mannerisms they have incorporate into one giant amalgam of foreignness that defies human categorization, making them something truly different and therefore frightening to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenophobia is a major theme in Lilith&#039;s Brood and other great works of science fiction like Ender&#039;s Game and later novels in the Foundation series.  This idea of being confronted by something so drastically different in appearance, behavior, and biology, yet with mental faculties and ideas similar to our own truly frightens us and necessitates exploration, and Butler does this well in Lilith&#039;s Brood.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Interstellar Buddhism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/124</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The clash of duality and singularity is the overarching theme and conflict in Ursula LeGuin&#039;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot;  Many things on Gethen seem to exist in a state of oneness rather than parity, and while the contrasting of Genly Ai&#039;s dualistic worldview against this new &quot;norm&quot; is how this idea is predominantly played out, many fail to notice that there do exist examples of pairing within the Gethenian society and planet, and I feel there to be yet another overarching theme that can be derived out of this clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genly comes from Terra, if I&#039;m not mistaken also known as our own planet Earth, and brings with him a mind preconditioned to seeing things in opposition.  For example, he tells his companion Therem Harth rem ir Estraven, a native Gethenian of the Yin and Yang symbol, telling Estraven that &quot;Light is the left hand of darknessâ€¦ how did it go?  Light, dark.  Fear, courage.  Cold, warmth.  Female, male,&quot; (267).  This very clearly demonstrates how Genly tries to view things, in pairs.  Similarly, Genly often tries to classify the Gethenians into the paired sexual confines he is used to, male and female, when describing them in his self-proclaimed story-report, telling of &quot;[His] landlady, a voluble man,&quot; and of another, &quot;wiping the sweat from his dark forehead the man â€“ man I must say, having said he and his,&quot; (47, 5).  To us the first description seems a strange contradiction, and the second an unnecessary attempt at explaining pronoun selection, yet his struggle is not without merit.  He finds it very difficult on Gethen to split people, places, and other thing into their Terran dualalities, and finds that the Gethenians themselves see things in quite a contrasting manner due to the strangeness of their planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the greatest reason that Gethen and its inhabitants defy division into pairs stems from the physiological design of the Gethenian people.  They are for the greater part of their lives, androgynous beings incapable of separation into male or female, and often exhibiting characteristics typical of both, evidenced by the voluble male landlady.  Also, the planet is in an almost perpetual state of winter without really any other strong seasons, meaning the weather almost everyday is &quot;snowy&quot;, and the inhabitants are comprised of the same race rather than the many different peoples of Earth and other planets within LeGuin&#039;s universe.  Notice, though, that all examples but my final are conditional, revealing that pairings do in fact exist on this world of singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gethenians do split into male and female beings during their period of kemmer, much like a menstrual cycle.  Genly describes how &quot;I saw a girl, a filthy, pretty, stupid, weary girl looking up into my face as she talked, smiling timidly, looking for solace.  The young Orgota was in kemmer, and had been drawn to me,&quot; (171).  During this stage, they react to their kemmer partner and their anatomy transforms to fill the roles of male and female, giving us the customary parity.  Even in the absence of racial divisions one can find a substitute in governmental designations between the two Gethenian nations of Karhide and Orgoreyn.  Karhide on the one hand is a monarchy, ruled by King Argaven in form very similar to a European monarchy, while Orgoreyn is almost blatantly structured as a socialist state where everyone is given a job by the government, things are shared, and dissidents and criminals are sent to &quot;farms&quot; as punishment, a contrast much like that between the governments of Western Europe and the Soviet Union.  So, as one may note, dualism is not absent on Gethen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this talk of pairing and oneness I feel to be aside from the true message of the novel.  If one examines a bit further, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; can be seen rather as a religious or spiritual text.  Both the Gethenians and the Ekumen of Known Worlds, the interplanetary league Genly works for as an Envoy, are in the end on a quest towards the same goal: Enlightenment.  Now, they aren&#039;t working towards strictly the same type of enlightenment, but ideas and principles are much the same.  The Ekumen searches for Enlightenment by means of connecting all mankind to create greater and more knowledgeable beings.  As Genly explains it, the Ekumen searches for &quot;material profit.  Increase of knowledge.  The augmentation of the complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent life.  The enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God,&quot; (34).  This sounds very much like a spiritual journey, except instead of it being an individual&#039;s quest, it is undertaken by all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gethenians also have their goal of Enlightenment, set before them by a very Buddha-esque figure, Meshe.  Followers of the Yomesh cult are &quot;obedient to their rule of inactivity or non-interference.  That rule (expressed in the word nusuth, which I have to translate as &#039;no matter&#039;) is the heart of the cult,&quot; (60).  Additionally, according to legend, &quot;Meshe is the Center of Timeâ€¦ The life of every man is in the Center of Time, for all were seen in the Seeing of Meshe, and are in his Eye.  We are the pupils of his Eye.  Our doing is his Seeing: our being his Knowing,&quot; (162-3).  Meshe is the quintessential &quot;enlightened being,&quot; knowing and seeing all at once, and a similar state is sought by many of the Gethenians.  So in fact, this is a book about the Duality of Gethen and the Ekumen both seeking out the goal of Oneness within the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Prisoners in their own system</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/97</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale depicts a world in which women are highly subservient to men, some even to the point that they only exist to fulfill the biological process of reproduction necessary for the survival of the species.  Such is the lot of our protagonist Offred, and it is from her we get our entire perspective of the civilization of Gilead, a society in which she and many other women are very much prisoners and slaves.  This society is very strictly controlled and repulsive to our modern ideals of freedom and justice within a nation, and shares some striking points in common with Nazi Germany.  Even more striking and frightful is Atwood&#039;s claim that most of what was written, the trends, the occurrences, the injustices, was grounded in real events of her modern era, the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels with Nazi culture are prevalent and plentiful.  Gilead is a very homogenous society in which everyone is Caucasian, a somewhat lessened version of Hitler&#039;s Aryan Master Race, but continues to exclude further down by relegating its citizenry to those of a single Christian (I believe it&#039;s Christian, I may be wrong) faith.  We even find persecution of Jews in Gilead, where was composed &quot;the Jewish repatriation scheme, with the result that more than one boatload of Jews was simply dumped into the Atlanticâ€¦ from what we know of [those in charge], this would not have bothered [them] much,&quot; (307).  Much like Hitler&#039;s rallies and grandiose speeches, Gileadean subjects are sometimes called to mass gatherings to listen to propaganda and further entrench themselves in the customs and offenses of the nation as a whole.  At a Prayvaganza, the Commander &quot;ascends the steps to the podium, which is draped with a red cloth embroidered with a large white-winged eyeâ€¦ &#039;Today is a day of thanksgiving,&#039; he begins, &#039;a day of praise&#039;â€¦ a speech about victory and sacrifive.  Then there&#039;s a long prayer, about unworthy vessels, then a hymn,&quot; (218).  Now, political rallies and the like are by no means a strictly Nazi practice, but the effects and levels of participation observed in those of Gilead do hold similarities.  In Nazi Germany, such rallies were used to brainwash large amounts of people to accept the oppression and eventual slaughter of countless Jews and minorities, making them accessories toÂ¬ the commission of crimes against humanity.  &quot;I&#039;ve leaned forward to touch the rope in front of me, in time with the others, both hands on itâ€¦ then placed my hand on my heart to show my unity with the Salvagers and my consent, and my complicity in the death of this woman,&quot; (276).  In one instance they even go as far as to rend a man to pieces with their bare hands upon provocation by their superiors.  One common argument coming out of Nazi Germany after the war was that people had essentially brainwashed themselves or had been brainwashed to accept the genocidal efforts as something that had to be done, much at the behest and influence of the state, and that they weren&#039;t entirely sure how they could have done such things, but such can be the power of speech and gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final real point I want to make is that, at least in this early Gileadean culture, women don&#039;t seem to be the only captives.  Granted they&#039;ve got it much worse off, but from the sparse scenes we are given that include males that are a part of the culture, it seems that they too are very much prisoner to their own system.  The Commander, obviously rather high in the social strata, finds the need to escape the rigidity of the world he helped to craft, smuggling Offred, his newfound mistress to a not so secret brothel.  &quot;&#039;Well?&#039; he says. &#039;What do you think of our little club?&#039; &#039;I thought this sort of thing was strictly forbidden.&#039; I say. &#039;Well, officially,&#039; he says. &#039;But everyone&#039;s human, after all,&#039;&quot; (236-7).  The commander admits need for change and the enactment of behaviors not allowed in Gilead, and it appears many other high ranking officials (all male of course) feel the same way, as the brothel is extremely busy.  Nick, a servant to The Commander, similarly has his vices in this highly controlled society, conducting frequent trysts with Offred that could cost him his life, then going to the ultimate illegal lengths by not only being part of the Gileadean equivalent of a secret service, The Eyes, and a rebel faction known as Mayday at the same time.  It is even speculated in the epilogue that this double life caused his downfall, for as &quot;Ofglen&#039;s association with Mayday had been discovered, he himself was in some jeopardy, for as he well knew, as a member of the eyes, Offred herself was certain to be interrogated,&quot; and so he helped Offred escape, when &quot;he could of course have assassinated her himself, which might have been the wiser course, but the human heart remains a factor,&quot; (311).  Both the commander and Nick help create and enforce the system that entraps and removes the freedoms of womankind, but as we see, their own emotions and humanity is similarly imprisoned to drastic degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last little aside, I&#039;d just like to call to everyone&#039;s attention the passage on page 186, in which Offred thinks, &quot;The pen between my fingers is sensuous, alive almost, I can feel its powerâ€¦ Pen Is Envy, Aunt Lydia would sayâ€¦ I envy the Commander his pen.&quot;  Seriously, &quot;Pen Is Envy?&quot;  Yeah, that&#039;s not obvious at all.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Brain/Body Brawl</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/60</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most preeminent theme in William Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is the conflict between body and mind.  In the futuristic world presented, those specializing in tasks of the mind are given a special status among the rest of society.  These elite are known as &quot;cowboys,&quot; specially trained and skilled individuals who are able to comprehend and even manipulate the workings of cyberspace, essentially a more developed form of the modern internet.  The protagonist, Case, is one of these cowboys, and his path through the novel, along with the paths of several other characters, greatly illustrates this duality of mind and body and the conflict inherent between the two.&lt;br /&gt;
The prevailing notion given by the book is that the mind is stronger and more important than the body.  We see this first in the protagonist, Case, one of the elite cowboys of the time.  The majority of his life is spent not in the corporal realm, but rather in the digital world of cyberspace, an area where thought processes and logic rule over all.  Such an existence leads to a specific mind frame, and for Case, &quot;as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh.  The body was meat,&quot; (6).  As such, Case and other cowboys attempt to deny the flesh as much as possible, focusing entirely upon the growth and expansion of the mind.  Case himself describes how, as he delves deeper and deeper into cyberspace, loses his connection to the physical world: &quot;Its rainbow pixel maze was the first thing he saw when he woke.  He&#039;d go straight to the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in.  He was cutting it.  He was working.  He lost track of days,&quot; (59).  At points, Case is able to completely deny his flesh and continue the existence of his mind within Cyberspace, thanks to the intervention of an AI called Wintermute.  Case holds a conference with Wintermute, learning what is really going on and who is running the show, and when he comes out, he wakens to the conversation: &quot; &#039;It&#039;s cool,&#039; Molly said.  &#039;It&#039;s just okay.  It&#039;s something these guys do, is all.  Like, he wasn&#039;t dead, and it was only a few secondsâ€¦.&#039; &#039;I saw th&#039; screen, EEG readin&#039; dead.  Nothin&#039; movin&#039;, forty second,&#039; &quot; (121).  An EEG measures brainwave activity, and while Case had been talking to Wintermute, his along with other vital signs ceased completely, effectively meaning his body and flesh  had died, and yet he was able to continue on in the mental world of the Matrix.  Similar experiences occurred to another Cowboy and character in the novel, the Dixie Flatline, which is perhaps the greatest representation of mind conquering body.  The Dixie Flatline is in fact a cyberspace entity that is a reconstruction of the behaviors and techniques of a real life person, McCoy Pauley, who is dead.  Yet when Case jacks in, he is able to confer and operate with the Flatline as if it were the real person still, essentially meaning that the Flatline has achieved life beyond the existence of the body.  It is revealed, however, that the mind is not truly independent of the body.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer also has its share of examples in which the mind still relies upon a physical operator.  The crew of the novel includes a street samurai named Molly, essentially the inverse of Case.  Molly is the brawn of the operation, doing physical break-ins and theft.  She becomes Case&#039;s link to the corporal when a simstim switch is installed to his deck and her body, a link that allows his consciousness to co-occupy her body.  He describes the experience as an &quot;abrupt jolt into other fleshâ€¦ her body language was disorienting, her style foreignâ€¦ she slid a hand into her jacket, a fingertip circling a nipple under warm silk.  The sensation made him catch his breath,&quot; (56).  Despite using Cyberspace to escape from his body, he is drawn back into the physical world through the simstim link contained within cyberspace.  Perhaps the greatest example of the reliancy of mind upon body involves the relationship between Wintermute and Armitage/Corto.  Wintermute is an AI, arguably making it entirely a logical and mental entity with essentially no physical existence.  However, to achieve its goals and plans, it has to enlist the help of a physical being, Colonel Corto, and creates a new personality called Armitage within the earthly shell that is Corto.  Armitage allows Wintermute to communicate with the various members of the crew without them having to be in Cyberspace, along with conducting business and other logistical arrangements necessary for the evolution of Wintermute.  Without this being, Wintermute would have had difficulting getting Case to join as the cowboy of the operation, for Case had lost all cyberspace capabilities until Armitage, under the control of Wintermute, arranged for surgeons to restore Case&#039;s necessary brain functions.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer is in the end a novel of the evolution of a mind (Wintermute) into a supermind, and as is expected, a large part of the novel focuses on the superiority of logic and mental capabilities over the physical body.  However, it also acknowledges that the body is often necessary as a support to the mind, and very few mental entities are able to transcend this reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Entertainment in Night City</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/46</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#039;ve noticed in many more recent sci-fi and other-genre works detailing near futures of our world is the tendency for some of humanity&#039;s most animalistic and basic (as in low) behaviors to become much more widely accepted and popularized.  In the Neuromancer, we have the entirety of Night City essentially run on illegal trade of drugs, data, sex, and other blackmarket operations and goods. Sure, most of it is justified by Case as &quot;a deliberately unsupervised playground for technology itself,&quot; for new medical procedures, cybernetics, and other such inventions to be field tested without regard to regulatory action, but much of the business is extraneous to this.  I&#039;m almost completely certain you don&#039;t need to field test narcotics and hallucinogens for legal trade at least.  The only form of sport even presented in the novel is a knife-fight to the death, which is well received by attendees.  It all just seems a bit chaotic and insane, especially in contrast to more classic idealizations of future earth civilizations where everyone gets along fine, wears the same silvery jumpsuits, and only worries about violence coming from an invading alien race that wishes to steal our well-preserved natural resources.  I feel that these depictions are very much a result of changes in political climates.  Starship Troopers, for example, has a pretty clear divide between the entirety of the human race and its bug enemy, and was written not long after WWII and Korea, times when we had a pretty good sense that we were in fact the good guys and they were the bad guys (maybe not as strongly in Korea, but still pretty good).  The Neuromancer, on the other hand, came out near the end of the Cold War and after Vietnam, which were very ambiguous wars, and things like Watergate, which caused much national tension, leaving many skeptical of governments and human goodness, and reflects all this in its very grungy, corrupt representation of urban life and human relations.  So I wonder, which future will come out to be more accurate, which future are we more headed towards?  I&#039;m not gonna lie, the Neuromancer model seems much more exciting and interesting to me.  And there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;m wearing a silver jumpsuit regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
