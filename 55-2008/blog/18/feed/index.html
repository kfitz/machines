 <title>Slow River and the long-range privatization of biotechnology</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/228</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was very impressed by Slow River&#039;s depiction of the near-future applications, and consequences, of developing biotechnology and nanotechnology. The novel uses accurate, technical terminology to create a sense of reality; even for those readers who are not familiar with the technology Griffith is discussing, her faculty with it is obvious and lends authenticity to the novel. Furthermore, it is this background of science and its economics which makes the novel more than a simple, plot-driven work of fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
The novel brings up the fundamental issue of corporate involvement in the development and application of new technology. Up until very recently, most biotechnological and nanotechnological research has been conducted in academic settings; however, these settings have rarely proven broadly effective in developing useful, large-scale applications of these technologies. However, the recent involvement of large amounts of private funding has spurred rapid advances in certain areas of bio- and nanoengineering.&lt;br /&gt;
Slow River takes this trend to the extreme: catastrophic environmental failure on a world-wide scale has spurred the growth of powerful, private biotechnology firms, such as that of the van de Ouests.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is where one of the basic conflicts of the novel&#039;s setting becomes clear; it is implicit that without the privatization of bioremediation technology, and subsequent dominance of the relevant social services by these private firms, the technologies would never have been developed in the first place--or at least, not to its (in the novel) incredibly sophisticated level. Without these private firms, the necessary improvements in water quality, air quality, waste reclamation and so forth would not have occurred in the first place. However, this privatization has also created its own problem; the profit motive, while extremely effective at encouraging innovation, also creates ethical conflict. Those in charge of or dependent on the corporations which provide these social services are on some level obligated to serve the corporation, to maximize its profitability and influence; however, this is often directly at odds with worker safety, social safety and, at its largest scale, civic integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gattaca</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/220</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gattaca is a difficult and interesting movie. I find my feelings about its subject matter to be very much split between the positive and negative; while genetic manipulation provides great advances and has considerable potential, the movie makes clear the potential cost as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two potential benefits of genetic engineering which the movie touches on seem of particular interest to me. The first is the relatively obvious one: reversal of our genetic stagnation. As our medical sciences have advanced, our ability to keep people alive and reproductively sound--despite genetic or physiological flaws which would have otherwise precluded survival--has increased. While this is undeniably a good thing, it has the unfortunate side effect of having effectively stopped our species ability to move forward on a genetic level. Genetic engineering circumvents this problem; Darwinism becomes artificial and consciously driven, but is at least reintroduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interesting side-effect of large scale genetic manipulation of humanity--and an attendant public knowledge about the basic realities of genetics--is that it renders the race issue essentially moot. Genetic differentiation between races today is essentially negligible anyways; what becomes important in society is not superficial differences, but quantifiable genetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the artificial Darwinism introduced by the movie; while in the long run it will be beneficial to the species, it is the inherent model of Darwinism, that few are winners and many are losers, so to speak, that is the cause of our protagonist&#039;s troubles. The fundamental question raised by the movie, for which I have no answer, is this: our species must change in order to move forward and survive. How many is it acceptable to sacrifice along the way?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Genetics in Science Fiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/164</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After the brief discussion about genetics in class on Monday, I figured I&#039;d talk about my understanding of the genetics involved and how they would affect Oankali form and society. Although our current understanding of genetics limits our engineering methods to basically linking one gene to a single protein or trait, it&#039;s become pretty clear in the last decade that our genome is much more complicated than that--we are exponentially more complex than a fruit fly, for example, but we have less than double the actual number of genes that a fruit fly has. Clearly, although the physical complexity must be genetically derived, it cannot be purely explained by our current understanding of genomics. Given that, I think it&#039;s fair to allow Butler some wiggle room on the capacity of the Oankali to engineer particular personality traits--things like aggression, caution, violence, sexual drive, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
We seek to assign moral or societal values to the behavior of the Oankali. In particular, their drive to &quot;trade&quot; with species after species seems appalling to us; they seem to genetically pillage other species, imposing their own biological and societal forms. However, attempts for us to place a moral judgement upon that behavior are essentially inappropriate. This drive is a subtle, genetic one; just as we have a basic drive to reproduce on a genetic level, the Oankali enact this sort of genetic colonialism because of a desire, a need that is fundamental to them. To judge them for it is the same as judging humanity for seeking sex.&lt;br /&gt;
The differences between humanity and the Oankali are even more extreme than first appears. Although they appear largely human when amongst us, it must be remembered that their original form was closer to a sea urchin or jellyfish than an ape. Societal forms and moral strictures forming in such a different species would be truly unknown and potentially unknowable to us; the Oankali are truly and completely foreign, from a genetic level up to the extrapolated society, and we must keep that in mind when considering their motives.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Left Hand of Darkness and the Masculine Ideal</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/142</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Le Guin presents to us, in The Left Hand of Darkness, with a breed of human which is truly biologically asexual, and posits that many of the traits we consider implicit to mankind are a result of the way we categorize behaviors, activities, ideologies and so forth in a male/female, dualistic manner. To strengthen the distinction between &quot;us&quot; (represented by Genly Ai) and &quot;them&quot; (the Gethenians in general and Estraven in particular), she gives us a very distinctive, stereotyped view of masculinity and femininity through Genly Ai early in the novel. Estraven is said to have &quot;...a man&#039;s power...&quot; (p. 7) as part of his character; his ability to influence and command others is, for Genly Ai, an explicitly masculine trait. Moments later, Genly expresses his distaste for what he refers to as &quot;...feminine intrigue...&quot; (p.8). The strongest moment of defining the masculine/feminine divide occurs at the palace; Genly thinks&quot;...that at table Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit.&quot; (p. 12). Le Guin&#039;s assigning of these stock roles to men and woman--power and strength versus subtlety and charm--while serving a purpose in emphasizing the duality in our culture (and the lack of one in Gethenian culture), is also misleading, and can lead to a potential misunderstanding of the novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideals of masculinity and femininity are cultural, not integral to our biology. Even in so small a difference as (in my experience) Italian versus American culture, behaviors that are considered proper form for men in one place may be seen as totally effeminate in the other. This variation ranges much more once you leave the context of Western societies, so much so that in certain areas of the world (some groups in the Caribbean, for example) aggression and physical dominance is associated with women, while subtlety and child-rearing is largely the domain of men. While that fundamental issue of duality remains, the actual traits which define masculinity and femininity are essentially irrelevant. In presenting a stereotyped Western-American cultural bias for defining the male/female divide, I feel that Le Guin runs the risk of drawing the reader too far into that mindset; although Genly perceives &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; traits in Estraven, he is simply put incorrect; Estraven&#039;s character is a unified whole, lacking binary division or masculine or feminine traits. Only once Estraven is understood as a whole person, rather than a bizarre, discomfiting amalgation of apparently opposing traits does he, and his society as a whole, make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>first post</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/19</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So a couple thoughts on Heinlein. First of all, although I agree with the below comment that alien races can imply racial connotations, I think that in this case Heinlein used the communal properties of an insectoid race to demonstrate the potential power of a communist social structure in a species adapted to it--and to show it&#039;s fundamental incompatibility with human drives. Second, I think Heinlein&#039;s discussion of the source of political power, though not directly involving race or gender as a major factor, is a potentially useful tool for understanding modern political power relations.&lt;/p&gt;
