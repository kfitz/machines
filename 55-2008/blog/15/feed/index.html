 <title>race war?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/300</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;From the start, the relationship between humans and douen bears strong overtones of real-life race relations. Characteristic of both white-black and European-Native American relations are played out, although in each case the analogy is imperfect. Both are represented by the quick judgment by humans that the douen are inferior. Antonio, for example, starts out his relationship with Chichibud by calling the latter a beast, to which he responds &quot;Oonuh tallpeople quick to name what is people and what is beast.&quot; (92) This is certainly reminiscient of justifications for slavery, which tended to emphasize the inferiority and essential inhumanity of the slaves. Similarly, the subjugation of Native Americans was freqently justified by essentially racist ideas like manifest destiny, which was based on the presumption that land was the white man&#039;s to do with as he wished. The humans at the first settlement have similar ideas, as they expect duoen to call them &quot;boss&quot; and laugh at the idea of calling them Compere (which I assume is a term of respect, like &#039;sir,&#039; although I&#039;m not really sure).&lt;br /&gt;
	The duoen are clearly fearful of this type of human attitude, as Chichibud reveals right after Tan-Tan stmbles upon the foundry: &quot;Tan-Tan, if douens don&#039;t learn tallpeople tricks, oonuh will use them &#039;pon we...we see how allyou does act, even towards your own.&quot; (230-231) Here, though, is where the parallels fade a little. Unlike Africans, the duoen are not being taken from their homes to live in a society dominated by another race. Unlike Native Americans, they are not being invaded by an organized enemy. The humans come in one by one or in small groups, apparently with only what they can carry. There is no threat of a mass migration - no one on the other side of the portal would want to cross. It is unclear exactly how numerous the duoen are, but one has to assume that they vastly outnumber the humans. Additionally, they have taken the extremely prescient step of trading for knowledge as much as for goods. They trade for human artifacts, but they use them to learn as much as for their value as tools. To make a long story short, the duoen appear to be well on their way to winningany encounter with humans, misadventures at their papa tree notwithstanding (there, they seemed handicapped as much by their desire to avoid killing humans as by weakness). I would love to read a sequel to this novel merely to see how this situation develops, and how the human assumption of superiority fails when presented with experience to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Personal vs. social responsibility</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/265</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that the most interestig part of Snow Crash was Stephenson&#039;s ideas about what would take the place of government in a lawless society. The Mafia is the most obvious example of this. An organization that has always had to hide to some extent in our society is right out in the open in this futuristic America, and what is more, it seems to be one of the most enlightened ruling groups around. For example, when Jason mistakenly hand-delivers his package to Uncle Enzo, the contrast between the Mafia-controlled block and the ones held by Narcolombians are emphasized. On the Mafia block, &quot;Old ladies are walking the streets again. Children are waiting for schoolbuses and playing hopscotch on sidewalks that recently were stained with blood.&quot; (144) In contrast, when Jason is driving through the Narcolombian neighborhoods of Compton, he is constantly being shot at. Essentially, the Mafia has become a symbol of order, rather than one of lawlessness.&lt;br /&gt;
      The development of the Mafia in this way is actually fairly reasonable when one looks at the values that seem to have come to be respected in this new America. The story of the nearly late pizza early on in the book is a good example. Hiro feels completely justified taking absurd, impossible risks - to deliver a pizza on time. Of course, what is at stake is not the price of the pizza, but credibility. In a world with little or no legal accountability, the importance of personal accountability is magnified. A delivery company that promises to deliver in 30 minutes has to hold itself accountable, because the customers know that there is no one else with the power to do so. Paradoxically, because reneging on a contract has few legal ramifications, it becomes unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;
     This idea of personal or organizational as oppose to social responsibility and loyalty shows up in other places as well. For example, when Y.T. is caught by the MetaCops, she calls her boyfriend Roadkill for help: &quot;&#039;you&#039;re my boyfriend,&#039; she says, speaking very simply and plainly. &#039;If I get popped, you&#039;re supposed to come around and help bust me out.&#039; Isn&#039;t everyone supposed to know this stuff? Don&#039;t parents teach their kids anything anymore?&quot; (78) To Y.T., it is completely obvious that part of being a boyfriend is helping get one&#039;s girlfriend away form the cops. It doesn&#039;t seem like she&#039;s even really making a request here. She&#039;s not saying, &quot;please help me.&quot; Instead, she&#039;s pointing out Roadkill&#039;s personal responsiblity to her, a responsibility that she sees as binding. Again, personal responsiblity seems to take the role that leal or social responsiblity takes in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>dependence and self</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/238</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The theme of dependence is dominant from the start in Lore&#039;s relationship with Spanner. She arrives &quot;naked and nameless in the city.&quot; (5) When she first encounters Spanner, she is lying on the gorund, utterly helpless. Spanner nearly leaves her, but finally decides to help. Then, as Lore goes back to Spanner&#039;s home, she realizes that she &quot;needed this woman, Spanner; depended on her, in a way that was shocking.&quot; (11) For Lore, a child of privelege, confident in her education and her ability, this is a very difficult situation to accept. It is made even harder by the fact that she quickly finds herself in Spanner&#039;s debt, and forced to agree to join in her illegal activities in order to pay that debt. Her dependence is brought home to her by the fact that, while Spanner does ask her if she is willing, in reality she has no choice because she has nowhere else to turn.&lt;br /&gt;
    As Lore&#039;s relationship with Spanner continues, her dependence on Spanner for everything, from a place to hide to her goals and purpose every day begin to conflict with the individual she was before. Just before Spanner begins to teach her to steal, Lore meets Hyn and Zimmer, two fences. At first she doesn&#039;t know what to say, but then &quot;her early training, the endless meetings with local and national dignitaries, took over.&quot; (83) Then though, she is reminded of her dependence on Spanner, and she seems to draw away from her training. Subsequently, the two go out to steal slates, and Lore is taking her cues on what to say and how to act from Spanner. She listens to the other&#039;s stories, and uses her tactics. Her training is now essentially useless, and her dependent state causes her to develop, in a way, a new persona.&lt;br /&gt;
    Eventualy, Lore does make her way out from Spanner&#039;s shadow. This takes place over a period of time, and of course involves her finally getting a job and her own place to live, and all the steps she takes to pay Spanner back. However, I think the whole process may have begun somewhat earlier, in a surprising way. When Lore and Spanner go into the porn shop under their flat, we see for the first time Lore beginning to assert herself. While they are in the shop, she keeps making derogatory comments about the quality of the porn - &quot;I can do better than that;&quot; &quot;I was doing better work than this three years ago,&quot; (173) and so on. And Spanner responds. Lore&#039;s knowledge and ability have impressed her, and clearly given her the idea to have lore make better porn. Of course, at this time in the story Lore is still very much dependent on Spanner. However, by finally going back to something from her past, something of herself that is valuable and unique, she takes the first steps in psychologically freeing herself from that dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>response 3-12</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/199</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The mental status of the rats seems a little unclear. Clearly, they are seen as possessing far less than normal human intelligence. They are treated as animals (rats!) and have to be carefully instructed to perform even simple tasks. For example, the trainer in Muct says &quot;You tell a rat to take a shit, you gotta remember to tell &#039;er to pull her pants down first and pull &#039;em up afterwards.&quot; (14) Yet the man at the RAT institute says the procedure to become a rat will not change the narrator in the prologue, (5) and indeed it does not seem to other than the obvious effect on his will. He had trouble understanding things before; he still does after. However, after he gets the glove, the narrator is able to learn quickly and well, and it seems to be implied that his lack of understanding and personality before was largely caused by a lack of knowledge, the cycle of stupidity. (29) Once he begins to learn things, he feels and acts much more intelligent, and much more like a person. But if this is true, then why are all rats seen as stupid? Is it simply prejudice, a prejudice that they cannot combat because they have lost their volition? If not, how can the narrator&#039;s seemingly &quot;natural&quot; and curable stupidity be reconciled with the apparent loss of intellectual ability experienced by other rats?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>response to The left hand of darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/126</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a peripheral point in the novel, but wouldn&#039;t something like mindspeech completely change a society? I can&#039;t think of more than a couple of scientific advancements in human history that have been anywhere close to as important to the nature of human interaction than that would be. The telepathy itself is cool, but not all that important. The part that matters is that it is impossible to lie. Of course, people could still speak lies, but how could they ever get away with it in anything important? Why would anyone sign a contract without asking to be told in mindspeach that his/her partner intended to honor it? No innocent person would ever be put in jail (at least by accident), and detective work would become fairly easy. The legal status of mindspeech might get a little complicated (would people be required to mind-testify about crimes? Could it be monitored, physically and legally? If that turned out to be impossible, how would the questioner&#039;s honesty be verified, etc.), but that is not really the most interesting question it would raise.&lt;br /&gt;
	The social implications of mindspeach might, I think, go even deeper. I wonder if we would be able to handle a society where people could choose to prove their honesty at any point if they chose? Wouldn&#039;t we assume that anyone who did not want to mindspeak something he/she was saying was lying? If you told your girlfriend you loved her in mindspeach, and she answered in kind but in words, what would you think? There are two obvious directions such a society might go. In one, which the idealistic part of me wants to believe in, people would simply become utterly honest. There would be no true secrets, because even though not everything would be conveyed in mindspeach, there would always be the knowledge that one question could reveal anything. Because people understood that there were no secrets, maybe they would not get so offended about little things. Manners would more or less disappear over time, as honesty became a habit as well as a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;
	These ideas do not even brush the surface of how deeply society would be changed, I think. An honest society would be almost recognizable in a lot of ways. But there is also the question of whether humans are capable of creatng such a culture of honesty, even with a tool like mindspeach. What I think is probably more likely is that strong taboos would be created against asking personal or prying questions, and against using mindspeach except in specialized circumstances (the military and law enforcement might fall in this category). I really am not sure what to think about this question, but for me the most interesting part of the book was its offhanded way of addressing this incredibly revolutionary technology. As I have argued, it seems like it would change human life in very fundamental ways. I would love to hear what other people think about this. Also, in deference to the subjects out class is supposed to be about, has anyone noticed that the narrator is very sexist?&lt;/p&gt;
