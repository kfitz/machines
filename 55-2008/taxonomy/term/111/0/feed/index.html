 <title>Offred</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/85</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as I was toodling along and reading Handmaid&#039;s tale, I realized that I didn&#039;t know the protagonist&#039;s name, so I wiki-ed it.  I found it out, but hadn&#039;t yet gotten to the part with the explanation of WHY she was called Offred, so I just figured Atwood had made it up.  What I noticed about it was how similar it was to the word &#039;offered.&#039;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think this could possibly be a coincidence; Offred is &#039;offered&#039; to so many people.  She is offered to the Commander, as well as Serena Joy and the rest of the household, to Nick, to the Eyes at the end of the novel, to the larger machinations of the society.  She, as the narrator and representative of all the handmaids of Gilead, is offered to future scholars (and the reader) as a way to gain insight into the women&#039;s minds of that time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of this, she &#039;is offered&#039;; she never offers herself.  There is a passivity in this offering that is, I think, very similar to the one that she berates herself about in the time before.  Her little rebellions and transgressions, though they do carry a serious penalty, are ultimately pretty minor.  Whether it&#039;s laziness, inertia, the paralyzing power of fear, or something else, she pretty much lets everyone else decide her fate for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t mean to judge her actions or imply that she should have done something different, but she does let others offer her up with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
