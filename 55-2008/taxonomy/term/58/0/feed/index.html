 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading, I noticed several self-referential comments woven into the narrative, remarks that seemed to comment back on Neuromancer and the academic work surrounding it.  Though apparently Gibson is less aware than I thought him to be â€“ how did he not notice that he had created another character with the name Case? â€“ my personal opinion is that reader interpretation is as important, if not more important, than authorial intent.  I think that what I found was interesting, even if it was not planted there by Gibson to be found.  Or, perhaps, I am just recognizing false patterns, in which case this becomes interesting on an entirely different level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the academic work that has been done on Neuromancer discusses the mind-body divide, and how it plays out in cyberpunk in general and Neuromancer in particular.  The concept that we have both a body and a consciousness separate from it â€“ the mind or the soul â€“ is a philosophical construction dating to ancient Greek.  In Western culture, particularly, the mind became more and more privileged over the body, culminating in Neuromancer&#039;s fantasy of total escape from the body and into cyberspace.  The body becomes &quot;the meat thing,&quot; something to be disdained entirely (Neuromancer 55).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pattern Recognition, Gibson begins with his own assessment of Neuromancer&#039;s style of science fiction: &quot;We have no idea, now, of who or what the inhabitants of our future might be.  In that sense, we have no future.  Not in the sense that our grandparents had a future, or  thought they did.  Fully imagined cultural futures were the luxury of another day, one in which the &#039;now&#039; was of some greater duration&quot; (Pattern 58-59).  Rather than fantasize about an alternate dimension of disembodied minds that may never be, Pattern Recognition demonstrates how that feeling of escape from the body can be enacted with the technology we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he clarifies that an actual escape of the mind from the body is neither possible nor desirable â€“ he grounds consciousness more securely in the organs of the body.  Again speaking through Bigend, Gibson writes, &quot;what we think of as &#039;mind&#039; is only a sort of jumped-up gland, piggybacking on our reptilian brainstem and the older, mammalian mind, but our culture tricks us into recognizing it as all of consciousness&quot; (Pattern 71).  After reading article after article about the mind-body gap in Neuromancer, this appeared to me to be a direct reply from Gibson to all the academics who had been discussing his book amongst themselves for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he includes a mention of Parkaboy &quot;railing on about Mama Anarchia&#039;s tendency to quote Baudrillard and other Frenchmen who annoy him so deeply&quot; (Pattern 50).  Baudrillard&#039;s work on &quot;hyperreality&quot; was mentioned often in the articles I read about the disembodied mind, and though I obviously cannot be sure who the other Frenchmen are, the &quot;father of modern philosophy,&quot; Rene Descartes, the man responsible for the modern formulation of the divide between mind and body, was French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though many of the mentions Gibson makes in the beginning of the book seem critical of the concept of cyberspace, Cayce experiences the internet very much like Case experience the matrix.  Sure, she does not attach any electrodes to her head and go rushing around in receding city lights, but the internet provides her life with more meaning than the real world ever does.  The internet gives her the footage to obsess over, the catalyst for the sort of quest for truth that she embarks on, and Parkaboy, a better and truer match for her than anyone she could find in the real world by herself, as Boone Chu attests.  Though embodiment is not criticized in Pattern Recognition, as it is in Neuromancer, the mind is still the important bit of that partnership, capable of finding meaning in life much more profound on its own than fettered by the body.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer vs. Pattern Recognition: Evolution towards Ambiguity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/315</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search revealed to me that Pattern Recognition, the eighth novel by William Gibson, was the first to be on the New York Times Bestsellers list, and the first to be set in a contemporary world instead of a fantastical one. The increased overall popularity of the more recent William Gibson novels ( as opposed to Neuromancer, whose popularity was more of a word-of-mouth cult hit ) may be due to this; however, speaking personally, I found the contemporary world of Pattern Recognition less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing about Gibson&#039;s work is that it is so incredibly dense and detailed, convoluted with tech-slang and computer jargon everywhere. &quot; Cognitive estrangement &quot;, as mentioned in the first week; making a fictional world so strange that it forces us to re-examine the way we think about reality. Neuromancer&#039;s early-cyberspace world does this with its advanced technologies and virtual worlds. Pattern Recognition tries to do the same. Unfortunately, Pattern Recognition takes it too far, by creating a world ( ironically, even more &quot; grounded &quot; in our reality ) that&#039;s so alien that the message is lost in its own convolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, may well be the point. Gibson may be trying to show us that the future ( which we are living in now ) is even more alien and disconnected than we ever could have imagined. But the narrative didn&#039;t communicate this to me as well. Neuromancer may have been talking about a profoundly artificial world, but it did so through a more traditional narrative-- a designated ( if not actually ) heroic protagonist on an action-packed adventure, who ends up changing the world at large. The characters may have been thinner and more cliche, but they were identifiable-- familiar &quot; cliches &quot; to ground very unfamiliar ideas. The cast of Pattern Recognition are more complex, but also much harder to define, and thus I think the power of the statements in the book are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit: Case is an anti-heroic super-hacker, a &quot; console cowboy &quot; who could be a typical video game hero. Cayce is a design-sensitive marketing consultant who explores metropolitan board meetings, club scenes, and hotel arrangements in an attempt to find context and understanding in her multimedia world. More complex, but almost paralyzingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>natural vs. unnatural in neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/79</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Plot-wise, Neuromancer is probably one of the most convoluted books that I have ever read. Since it was difficult to stay with the story, I found myself observing how the characters related to the rich futuristic environment. What stood out to me the most was their relationship to the natural, represented both by human flesh and descriptions of the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of Neuromancer, there is an overall attitude of cynicism and contempt towards the natural. Human flesh is referred to as &quot;meat&quot; and the characters view their bodies as inferior to their minds, which can interact with cyberspace and the matrix. Case often denotes certain ideas or activities as inferior by saying &quot;that&#039;s a meat thing&quot; and discorporation is glorified. For example, when he learns that he is going to ride behind Molly&#039;s eyes via a simulation, Case says to himself &quot;cowboys didn&#039;t get into simstim, he thought, because that was basically just a meat toy&quot;(pg 55). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things keep the body from becoming completely useless: sex and death. The acknowledged beauty of human flesh is closely associated with women, Molly in particular. There are several passages that show Case enjoying Molly&#039;s body, focusing on different parts; he describes it as &quot;her body was spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer&#039;s&quot;(pg 44). However, one could say that Molly has made even the beauty of her body artificial and un-genuine by using it as a tool, part of her job as a prostitute. Death of the flesh, marked by the sight of blood, continues to be feared in the world of Neuromancer; so it is probably unlikely that anyone would actually want to lose their body, inferior as it may be to the machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seems that nature or the natural (here meaning things like trees, oceans, animals, water, plants) cannot exist apart from the artificial realm of computers and technology. All of nature has been tampered with, modified, or manipulated by some artificial force; essentially, it&#039;s all fake. There are several passages where Case describes the color or sense impression that something natural gives him by relating it back to technology. For example, the very first sentence of the book is &quot;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel&quot;(pg 1).  Another good example of this is when trees are used to show Case&#039;s unfamiliarity with nature: &quot;The trees were small, gnarled, impossibly old, the result of genetic engineering and chemical manipulation. Case would have been hard-pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak, but a street boy&#039;s sense of style told him that these were too cute, too entirely and definitively treelike&quot;(pg 128). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways these relationships to nature and the natural seem to be a direct comment on how we relate to nature in the real world today, or at least where we&#039;re headed. Things like oil drilling, bulldozing forests for economic gain, the presence of or denial of global warming, and the abundance of cosmetic plastic surgery suggest that our world is moving towards artificiality and the mass urbanization of the &quot;Sprawl&quot;. People these days spend more time with their cell phones, IPods, video games, and other technology than they do out in nature or interacting face-to-face with one another, so this book could be seen as a potential look at where we might end up.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Emotions of Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/78</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading response to Neuromancer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer.  How did it make me feel? I felt alternatively disgusted and thrilled.  I felt interested, and bored.  Some things seemed exotic and some things seemed far too normal.  The book seemed a paradox of extremes at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer&#039;s main character is very complicated.  At the start of the novel he is just like any other druggie with a life that&#039;s falling apart.  I didn&#039;t want anything to do with him, and barely felt any sympathy, as I saw how ratty and paranoid he was.  When he rented a weapon by the hour to make him feel safer, that is when I knew that he has hit rock bottom.  Someone paranoid enough to rent a gun like that is not right in the head.  What could he have done with it?  Had anyone actually wanted to kill him, hey would have just done it. And Had Case actually killed one or more of the hired guns he thought were after him, he would have been in worse shape, because more would have been sent, this time with orders to make his death very painful.  Case wasn&#039;t only a druggie though.  At points in the book, he was an impressive cyberspace cowboy.  He did computer/things that I can&#039;t even imagine.  He hacked things like they were nothing, though really complicated hacking just gave him pause enough to make him seem more impressive, because he had to fight over an obstacle.  His last cyberspace battle, with Straylight&#039;s ice and protection, was no harder than anything else he had done in the novel, and almost easier.  The only difference was that it took a fair amount of time, which made us able to emotionally connect with his conquest.  But in the end, I felt disgusted again.  Case learned almost nothing from his experiences, and an argument can be made that he learned absolutely nothing.  He replaced his liver and pancreas so that he could become a druggie again, got a cheap woman, and went back to doing cheap illegal labor.  He was not someone I look up to, and I was sad that his end was so ignominious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly had her contradictions too. She was thrilling, a street samurai with her nails, her heightened reflexes and her exotic glasses.  She seemed impressive from the first time that Case saw her and ran.  She became Case&#039;s bodyguard and protector, and saved him from death a few times.  All these things combined to make me more and more interested in her.  She seemed so cool, so powerful, and then Case discovered her in a Freeside whorehouse.  I was so disappointed.  This amazing character that seemed so impressive had such inauspicious beginnings.  The flaw (though you can&#039;t really call it a flaw) made her more human, and less of a street samurai.  She came back down to earth for me, and at times I was bored with her.  She was nothing more than a common whore.  And now, even as a street samurai, I saw her in a different light.  She was still selling her body for money; just now she was doing it slightly differently.  That put a different spin on her employment, and I was disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer was an awesome look at a dystopian future.  And while I have a second, I&#039;d like to say something about Blade Runner.  (Pardon the non sequiter)  That movie made absolutely no sense.  If I had not gotten so much more background from reading the book, I don&#039;t know if I would have gotten it.  What the hell was up with the naked robot with a dove in the end!?  Neuromancer had many emotions all rolled up into one, which is part of the reason it was such an interesting book.  But it was also part of the reason that I disliked some of the characters more than I thought I would.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The materials of the world of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/76</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;William Gibson&#039;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; manages to create worlds that are both an exercise n sensory overload and a frustrating lack of detail, leaving the reader confused as to the environment.  What is perhaps most interesting in this detailed description is the attention Gibson pays to material.  Scarcely a page goes by without some mention of a plastic window, a silk futon, a leather jacket, denim pants, or a fiberglass chassis.  A large part of what creates the futuristic sense of Gibson&#039;s world is the development of new materials and the unfamiliar hierarchy of materials, consisting of both the new and the jarringly familiar substances.  This hierarchy of material breaks down to two separate categories: body modification and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others on the blog have delved into the politics of body modification, the one point I would like to stress is the use of materials in body modification.  Ratz, a bartender, has a pink plastic arm.  There is a sense that Ratz has gone for a model that is somewhat similar to human flesh in color, and its function is to replace a lost limb, not to give him super-human powers.  Molly, contrastingly, has been fitted with retractable steel claws (Wolverine, anyone?  But better?) for fighting, masked by burgundy (dried blood colored!) nails.  Her visual enhancement is mirrors and metal, soldered to her face so that her own eyes are no longer visible.  Metal and silver-toned items have a warrior connotation in this world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all these enhancing devices are non-biological.  The only real mention of biological-based modification is in Case, with his magic anti-drug pancreas and liver.  There is also a brief moment when Wage is said to have &quot;vatgrown eyes&quot; (21) that only serve a cosmetic use.  There is a sense that the non-biological enhances, while the biological can only replace and aestheticize or streamline and detract from what the body can already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When materials are used by people, not to form people, a reverse hierarchy is revealed.  The Villa Straylight is filled with wooden doors and cabinets, wool rugs, glass cases and other natural substances.  These &quot;natural&quot; items are considered luxuries, with the implication that as society developed, expanded, and sprawled, natural resources became increasingly rare.  Interestingly, though, Molly continually is found on silk futons (28) and wearing leather (29, 176), both animal products.  Case earns a &quot;new leather jacket&quot; (68) when he successfully completes his part of the mission to steal Flatline Dixie from storage.  There is a premium placed on organic materials, creating the assumption of scarcity of such materials.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, almost every building seems to be made of rough concrete with plastic windows*.  The structures of this new near future have been built for functionality and durability.  Luggage is all nylon, making it more durable and practical.  The scarcity of materials does not allow for a flagrant show of luxury items, particularly in places they are vulnerable to the elements and the public.  Even the treasures of Villa Straylight are housed in a cold concrete shell.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one might expect the Rastafarians to have some connection with nature, especially given that they are a completely self-sufficient space island (226), this is actually the world in which there is the least natural materials.  Instead, rooms are broken up by sheets of yellow plastic, and clear caulk decorates the Zionist ships.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the raw materials of this future world are often very familiar to current audiences, the proportions of materials used is very foreign.  By emphasizing the manufactured and cold steel and concrete, the world Gibson creates becomes colder and subtly more sinister than our current one, familiar yet disconcertingly alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disconnect the reader feels with this slightly skewed &quot;real&quot; world serves as contrast to the completely new, yet somehow more understandable world of cyberspace.  Cyberspace is a relatively simple world, composed of light, basic geometric shapes, and precise grids that allow for precise locations and documentation of movement.  There is a simple order in cyberspace that is distinctly lacking in the real world.  By making cyberspace a simpler space (at least until the AIs get involved and bring personality and humanoid constructs/hallucinations into the plain geometric world), Gibson seeks to create a greater connection between the reader and Case, to clarify Case&#039;s preference for cyberspace over the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*While I will not refute the impressive durability of plastic, the one issue I took with its prevalence in the novel, a world that it is indicated is run by fusion plants (85) and full of &quot;the rusting shells of refineries&quot; (85), indicating that oil is no longer the fuel that runs the world, plastic is a petroleum byproductâ€¦  Poking around the internet, there&#039;s also cellulose-based plastic (celluloid) and nylon is completely synthetic, but neither of these are strong enough to serve in buildings.  The only other info I can find helpfully tells me plastic is made from polymers.  Is there some completely synthetic plastic that I&#039;m missing?  Is there an assumption that we will recycle plastic till we make miracle buildings that will stand forever?  Or is plastic just meant to sound more durable and futuristic than glass?  I realize it&#039;s probably this last answer, but I am also genuinely interested about plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Techno-Eden? (Gibson response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/75</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in what people make of Gibson&#039;s invocation of the mythologized Fall  from Eden (common to the Western monotheistic traditions) to thematize Case&#039;s feelings about his initial neurological damage--and his ontological status more generally: &quot;For Case, who&#039;d lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it [the damage] was the Fall. In the bars he&#039;d frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh.&quot; (7) It&#039;s interesting that Gibson chooses to use the metaphorical (as opposed to, e.g., simile) structure to recall this particular theological referent. For Case, the damage was not &quot;like&quot; a fall; it is a fall. Furthermore, the damage is not a fall, but in fact, the Fall--the singular fall from (Eden into the world of sin) that supposedly defines human subjectivity. If this is true, however, what happend to Case&#039;s originary Fall? If the damage inflicted by his old bosses = the Fall, what about the foundational imperfection that&#039;s Biblically posited as universal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case&#039;s situation seems to present the following existential schematic (in linear order [though Eden can never really be said to &quot;exist&quot; as such; it&#039;s more of a mythical &quot;past that was never present&quot;]): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eden -- Fall -- Re-realization of Eden (via cyberspace) -- Fall (from damage) -- ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Case&#039;s second Fall (from the neurological damage) was, in fact, &quot;the Fall,&quot; it seems to imply one of two things: either a) the first &quot;Fall&quot; was illegitimate (i.e., not really a &quot;fall&quot;) and thus the second, post-damage &quot;Fall&quot; is the sole constitutive fall of Case&#039;s person, or b) the re-realization of Eden through cyberspace was illegitimate (i.e., it may have felt Utopian, but it actually wasn&#039;t) and thus the second, post-damage &quot;Fall&quot;merely re-instantiates the originary Fall from Eden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both routes have interesting consequences. On the one hand, the illegitimacy of the originary Fall (from Eden) denotes an unorthodox--though currently dominant--sensibility w/r/t imperfection. Anti-Utopianism (&quot;humans will be always be flawed&quot; / &quot;things will never be perfect&quot; / etc.) is widespread in the postmodern world; contemporarily, it is hardly radical to suggest that imperfection is an irreducible aspect of social life. Indeed, once it becomes incoherent--or plain and simple naive--to envision perfection, it no longer makes sense to talk about an originary Fall predicated on the notional idea of an Eden, since Eden is an inherently un-realizable &quot;perfect&quot; space. In other words, if we buy the premise that life is irrevocable in its imperfection (and let&#039;s be clear: this premise can be highly redemptive), then the &quot;Fall&quot; simply describes how things are. In which case, it&#039;s not a fall; it&#039;s reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second proposition--the illegitimacy of techno-Eden, implying that Case&#039;s damage re-instantiates, as opposed to invents, the Fall--is best understood in terms of the psychoanalytic concept of &quot;lack.&quot; Case&#039;s claim that his damage &quot;was the Fall&quot; clearly presumes that his pre-damage condition (i.e., neuronal firings immersed in cyberspace) was worthy of being deemed &quot;Eden&quot;--a tall order indeed. While it&#039;s easy to maintain a haughty distance from this claim (after all, we [cynics] know that digital life will never offer the same fruits as material life), is this not an example of Case taking advantage of the exact same defense mechanisms (or at least homologous defense mechanisms) that most of us employ on a daily basis? Here, he has simply generated an &quot;if only&quot; narrative--&quot;If only I could jack in, I&#039;d be fine!&quot; / &quot;If only those criminals hadn&#039;t afflicted me, I&#039;d be happy!&quot;--that should be familiar to anyone who&#039;s ever had to contend with disapointment (e.g., &quot;If only I got that shiny new red wheelbarrow [on which everything might depend], I&#039;d be happy!&quot;). In this sense, Case&#039;s damage (and the feeling of &quot;Fall&quot; that accompanies it) gestures toward the *historicity of lack* in human experience--that is, the way in which lack manifests itself over and over again: precisely by way of the pathological formations that we use to (falsely) fill the space of lack, the content of which might change from historical period to historical period (as it does for Case, when his expectations change from human to trans-human), but the form of which continually reproduces and re-articulates itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might Case&#039;s name be of some significance in this respect? What if we &quot;Case&quot; as the limit-example of particularism (which is, in some sense, exactly what&#039;s at stake--both concretely and abstractly--in the mind v. body question, especially in light of its racialized and gendered overtones)? Western metaphysics has tended to conceive of particularity and universality in dialectical terms, which is to say, as if the two were caught in perpetual, fundamentally insoluble tension. This dialectical tendency presents universality and particularity as mutually exclusive: I can make universal claims or particular claims, but not both at the same time; I can uphold my universal duty (e.g., to not steal) or my particularistic duty (e.g., extenuating circumstances that force me to steal in order to feed my family), but not both. Might Case occupies the hybrid, connective space between universality and particularity? (For instance, a &quot;case study&quot; designates the particularized example that we use to elucidate the universal point; &quot;In case of emergency&quot; prefaces a universal space for making particularized claims; etc.) A &quot;case&quot; is precisely what allows us to grasp the playing-out of a universal or trans-historical problematic (such as &quot;lack&quot;) in a particularistic or historical context. Perhaps Case embodies historicity itself?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>peace at last in an old, old war</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/74</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I see that the body/mind issue has already been raised in responses, I&#039;m really interested in how Gibson addresses this, and I think I can take a sufficiently original tack that my response will further the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between mind and body is given a very complex treatment in Neuromancer, full of apparent contradictions that I am still trying to work out.  On the one hand, the mind in Neuromancer is closer than ever to being able to transcend the physical body as it travels through cyberspace; on the other, the mind/body divide is becoming irrelevant as body modifications allow the body and mind to better reflect each other.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of my other classes, we just discussed an article by Kenneth Clark in which he pinpoints the genesis of the schism between mind and body.  In classical times, according to him, the body and spirit were one; gods were embodied, and athleticism (or perfecting of the body) was considered a type of worship.  By the Renaissance, however, the body was the source of sin, dirty and shameful: something that the mind had to strive to escape.  In Neuromancer, even as Gibson imposes our society&#039;s battle of mind and body onto his characters, the world he has created contains a potential solution to the battle, waiting to be found.&lt;br /&gt;
Case is a perfect example of the fight for the mind to defeat the imperfect, shameful body.  With his neurons fried and unable to loose his mind into cyberspace, he &quot;[falls] into the prison of his own flesh&quot; and is forced to confront his own embodiment (6).  He is unable to accept that he is tied to a body, and conditioned by the cowboy culture to hold &quot;a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh,&quot; he throws himself into an &quot;arc of his self-destruction&quot; that will unquestionably get him killed quickly (6,7).  In today&#039;s â€“ Gibson&#039;s â€“ world, we cannot escape the fact that we are bounded by our bodies and are incapable of full transcendence. Case had a taste of what transcendence is like.  When he re-enters cyberspace for the first time, he describes it as &quot;his distanceless home, his country&quot; while his body remains behind &quot;somewhere,&quot; laughing and moving but now entirely separate from his consciousness (52).&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson is so busy indulging our fantasy of, through technology, getting closer to defeating the body that he does not take advantage of the technology that could potentially resolve the body v. mind war.  Escaping the body would no longer be necessary.  Body modifications are, in our world and Case&#039;s, a way for the consciousness of the mind to mark the natural body to which it belongs.  It somewhat externalizes the mind and links the mind and body.  The outer body and the inner mind are brought closer into alignment.  In Neuromancer, modifications are no longer limited to piercings, tattoos, scarring, and an occasional plastic surgery.  Pretty much anything is possible, aesthetic or practical. The Panther Modern leader, heading up a flashy terrorist group, adds color, changes pupils, shapes features until he resembles &quot;some kind of a state of the art gargoyle&quot; more than a human (67).  Molly&#039;s job and identity is that of a fighter, so she adds retractable scalpel blades to her hands (25).  The technology of Neuromancer allows the members of its population to prod, pierce, and pull at their bodies until it reflects the inner mind.  Conversely, additions to the body can affect the mind; attaching microsofts to the body grants the individual new knowledge and abilities.  Through these additions, subtractions, and modifications, the mind and body reflect each other perfectly and can me integrated into a single, harmonious entity.  n this way, technology is no longer needed as a tool to defeat either mind or body; it erases the need for the war altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darn.  I was hoping for feedback on this idea, because I feel like it&#039;s a little out in space, but I took a really long time to write it and now it&#039;s really late and everyone sane has already finished blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>fly-by meat</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/72</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Observation, I think it&#039;s rather interesting that the hotels/beds get referred to as coffins.  I&#039;m not entirely certain if this is societal, which would be interesting, given the focus on body modification, or if it&#039;s just Case, in which case that goes along with his death wish and frustrations and self-loathing of his body.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Case first meets Armitage, he is described as looking like &quot;he [was] carved from a block of metal; inert, enormously heavy.  A statue&quot; (29).  Armitage ends up being a rather hollow construct of Wintermute&#039;s not truly a person, and without any real personality.  Foreshadowing?  Or a commentary on the gradation of life and its connection/need for the flesh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whores are called puppets, and serve as pure body without mind, like giant slabs of living meat, extend the metaphor as far as you like.  When Riviera does his projection show, the last thing he &quot;creates&quot; is Molly&#039;s face.  Molly is treated publicly in this instance as meat.  Molly has just eaten &quot;real&quot; meat, from a full animal, not one grown as parts in a vat.  We soon found out that Molly was once a puppet, and one that was highly degraded.  This discovery comes while she is seeking solitude and privacy in a puppet cubicle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As frustrated as Case claims to be of the needs of the flesh, he&#039;s still quite groovy with the pleasures of the flesh.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t really have a direction for all this, but the thoughts kept bouncing around my head--pleasure seems key to the concept of meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALSO!  Cold!  the T-A&#039;s exist in cold suspention.  The cold drives Ashpool mad to the point of suicide, which he meditates on on page 184.  Case is cold when he&#039;s held captive by Neuromancer.  Ice is all the frack over cyberspace, and acts as a barrier.  Cold is isolating, but in interesting ways and somewhat non-traditional ways.  There are lots of other instances of cold, but, alas, I am lacking in a searchable version of the text, and don&#039;t really want to pay for the book a second time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have control over Case are also always crushing gnats, whereas Case has to deal with the more dangerous wasps, and return of the hive mind.  But, again, sad lack of searchable text.  One gets spoiled, reading books no longer under copyright protection...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an amusing yet thought provoking short story on meat I got from mw that I kept think of whenever the term was used in &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html&quot;&gt;http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>synesthesia</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/71</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, did anyone else notice the little bits of synesthesia that popped up throughout neuromancer?  There&#039;s an &quot;aching taste of blue&quot; on page 257, Molly&#039;s pain as &quot;neon worms in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill&quot; on 217.  I&#039;m pretty sure there was something else as well, but now I can&#039;t find it.  If its significant in any way, I&#039;m sure it has to do with the whole mind-body problem, but mostly its just a random observation.&lt;br /&gt;
Did anyone pick up on any others?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Would you keep your meat?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/70</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We talked a fair bit in class about the troubled mind-body relationship present in Neuromancer.  Many of the characters make us question our assumptions of what it means to be alive, from the unembodied mind of Wintermute to the mindless body of Armitage, with multiple characters straddling the line between life and death at any given point.  Case is the one character who we are really allowed to connect with on any psychological level (though even that hold is tenuous, given the somewhat schizophrenic style of postmodern/cyberpunk writing). But even Case challenges our idea of what it means to be human, and alive.&lt;br /&gt;
The question is raised most obviously through his disgust of &quot;flesh.&quot; The body as a prison is not a new concept by any means, but Case takes his dislike to a new level, perhaps because he, unlike us, can actually separate body and mind to a certain extent.   When he finally does get to plug his mind into the matrix he&#039;s ecstatic, laughing &quot;distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face,&quot; his nearly orgasmic euphoria caused by being able to escape into his mind, after being tethered for so long (52).  He doesn&#039;t even like simstim because it&#039;s a &quot;gratuitous multiplication of flesh input&quot; (55). But ironically for him, this purely mental exercise is still dependant on the body.  He is only able to jack in again after extensive surgery, and at the end of the book, in order to ensure that his talent won&#039;t be destroyed again, he has to physically venture into the Tessier-Ashpool &quot;hive&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
But the evils of meat follow him, even into the matrix.  In Neuromancer&#039;s island world &quot;[Linda] pulled him down, to the meat, the flesh the cowboys mocked.  It was a vast thing, beyond knowing, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite intricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever read&quot; (239).  Even in what he knew was a programmed fantasy the drive held.&lt;br /&gt;
But for all his obvious protests, I&#039;m not really sure that Case really does want to transcend the body.  Neuromancer explains to him in their final showdown, in the setting of the beach, &quot;[t]o live here is to live. There is no difference&quot; (258).  Given that this statement is said by the enemy at the climax at the novel, we&#039;re clearly not supposed to agree.  But if the body simply is a useless, debilitating casing, then really I don&#039;t see why Neuromancer should be wrong.  Life on the beach with Linda seems better than any point of Case&#039;s existence in the &quot;real&quot; world, at least over the course of the novel.  So then why not abandon the real world entirely?  Perhaps he can&#039;t because such a feat is impossible, but I think Case&#039;s experiences while flatlining suggest otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
When he flatlines, Case is officially brain dead.  There is no electrical activity, at all, in his &quot;flesh.&quot;  But his mind is still functional. The first time flatlines is also the first time he meets Wintermute.  He describes shooting a gun during the episode: &quot;the recoil almost broke his wrist. The muzzle-flash lit the office like a flashbulb. With his ears ringing, he started at the jagged hole in the front of the desk. Explosive bullet. Azide&quot; (119).  That specific passage involves at least three sense, and the description is just as real as any other in the book.  The same goes for his time on the beach.  What gives the situation away as a sham is not fuzzy outlines to objects, or constant static ringing in his ears, but rather the overly convenient food packets.  These experiences feel just as real as any other to Case. He could live a potentially fulfilling life in cyberspace even after his physical brain is dead, so far as we can tell.  But he refuses to accept this fate.&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though parts of Neuromancer seem to praise the mind over body, exalt in the triumph of brain over brawn.  I think it represents an inherent fear of ever divorcing one from the other.  We cannot be truly human without both.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Breaking Down Cyberpunk: Matrix and Disillusionment</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/69</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer is widely known as the defining novel of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; subgenre (of which I am particularly a fan) â€“ so, regardless of what has happened in science fiction since then, the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; was specifically applied to this novel as a defining mark. Therefore, disassembling that word should provide some insight into the defining features of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a composite of two terms - &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;, the sources are obvious. The &quot;cyber&quot; doubtlessly refers to &quot;cyberspace&quot;, the term coined by Neuromancer for describing the world in which people enter when they plug into the &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; of the matrix. Much of the novel is set in this realm: if we count time spent on simstim, Case is in cyberspace probably more often than everywhere else combined. So that much is obvious â€“ the &quot;cyber&quot; means that the characters live in a universe where a digital communication network is as important â€“ if not more important â€“ than the physical world, otherwise known as &quot;meatspace&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other part, the &quot;punk&quot; half, is perhaps more interesting. The characters of Neuromancer, Case especially, aren&#039;t good guys. Case doesn&#039;t work for charity, he doesn&#039;t fight for what&#039;s right, and his only motivations appear to be self-preservation, the pursuit of the next high, and simple hatred. But that&#039;s simplifying things. For a moment, Case is something different, when he spouts at 3Jane: &quot;What&#039;ll ever fucking change for you? You&#039;ll wind up like the old man. You&#039;ll tear it all down and start building again! You&#039;ll build the walls back, tighter and tighter....I got no idea at all what&#039;ll happen if Wintermute wins, but it&#039;ll change something!&quot; (260). For this moment, it seems like Case is hoping for a better future, not just for himself, but for 3Jane and everyone else. But that&#039;s not what happens. In the end, &quot;Things aren&#039;t different. Things are things,&quot; and that&#039;s all that Post-Wintermute has to say about it. And after that final revelation, Case gives up and reverts to his previous self, blowing his reward cash on a new pancreas and liver that will allow him to receive normal effects from the amphetamines to which he is addicted.  Case undergoes a transformation from criminal, to idealistic hero, back to disillusioned criminal.  In this way, the cynical message of the book can be seen to represent the &quot;punk&quot; aspect â€“ and this is the attitude which defines not only Neuromancer, but the cyberpunk genre in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Limits of Alienation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/68</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The claim has been made that Neuromancer celebrates in a way previously unattested to in the annals of SF the existence of mind without body. While I am not wholly convinced of this, I think the secondary readings that we had this week offer a window to a reading that balances on the scales of class the consideration given by the novel to the possibility of thinking without feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
	Both Huntington and Olsen observe cyberpunk&#039;s particular investment in a social &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;underclass&quot;: &quot;Neorealists focus on the trials and tribulations of the spoiled homogeneous upper middle class; cyberpunks explore the heterogeneous fringes of our culture&quot; (Olsen 148); &quot;The class-generated structure of feeling that we seek to uncover reveals itself not in the concrete surface references but in the formal structure of the work&quot; (Huntington 136). Here, Huntington is clearly referring to &quot;newness&quot; as a formal property of the text; Olsen would probably think that narrative disjunction is the more salient formal property. Both properties, in both these essays, have the effect of situating the reader on the outside of the social structure in a way that&#039;s typically postmodern. (In fact, &quot;newness&quot; as Huntington describes it might be the same thing as &quot;narrative disjunction&quot;--which might be a better rebuttal to his claims, it seems to me, than the argument that &quot;cyberspace&quot; has become too familiar to be &quot;new.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
The book seems to advocate in favor of the mind without the body with respect (1) to the main character&#039;s affinity for cyberspace (2) to the main character&#039;s affinity for psychotropic drugs. Essentially, drugs and cyberspace seem to do exactly the same things for Case. Each of these examples is coded according to class.&lt;br /&gt;
To the first claim: In Neuromancer, drug use is equivalent to engagement in cyberspace is equivalent to the escape of the mind from the body. When Case describes his longing for cyberspace following his neurological maiming, it sounds exactly like drug withdrawal: &quot;He&#039;d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bed slab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (5). When Armitage arranges for Case&#039;s inability to get high, he equates the one activity with the other: &quot;&#039;Thanks but I was enjoying that dependency.&#039; &#039;Good, because you have a new one&#039;&quot; (45). Conversely, when Case starts using the drug betaphenethylamine (which conveniently bypasses his new pancreas and liver), the effects of the drug are always described as an escape from the flesh to the mechanical: &quot;His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed and polished&quot; (154); &quot;The high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly, flesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of his life&quot; (155). The phrase &quot;drug-flesh&quot; clearly delineates the extent to which drug usage--like the engagement of cyberspace--is opposed to fleshly existence. (In Neuromancer, the act of singing on to cyberspace is called &quot;jacking in&quot;; the TV show Futurama has a pretty good reading of this phrase and activity, actually: Bender the robot becomes addicted to the illicit use of electricity, which is called &quot;jacking on.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
	 That these examples are coded socially is somewhat more difficult to demonstarate. Both the Huntington and Olsen articles, to the extent that each is interested in class, point out that part of the difficulty of seeing class difference in a text that is committed to some (in this case, I would argue, many) aspects of postmodern representation is that the social order tends to be meaningfully obscured. Thus, the only real instance in Neuromancer in which we get a glimpse of a social group that&#039;s not clearly identifiable as &quot;fringe&quot;--as Huntington notes--is the Tessier-Ashpool aristocracy. They are, of course, users of many and varied drugs. The difference is that for them--and this is essentially all I have to aver in favor of my argument--is that drugs simply don&#039;t work; 3Jane: &quot;I find drug use in general to be boring&quot; (228). Ashpool is surrounded by drugs, true; but he is miserable, whereas Case is genuinely fond of both his addictions.&lt;br /&gt;
	In this case, the book&#039;s advocacy of a total split between the mind and the body might be a sort of Marxian parody via an extreme limit of alienation. As in, the only way to beat American capitalism is to beat it at its own game. If you live only in your mind, can you still be alienated from your labor?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Asian Persuasian</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/67</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly&#039;s long nails: In class on Monday when we discussed Molly, there was a comment made that long nails in America have this stigma of impracticality, and that Molly&#039;s nails are useful.  When I thought about her nails, especially in relation to Asian culture, I pictured instead those sharp metal nails (I wish I knew what they were called) that Chinese women used to wear on their fingers.  They were typically worn on the pinkie and ring fingers, and while I do not know what they were used for (ornamentation, probably), in Chinese shows or movies, sometimes an angry aristocratic woman will use them to viciously scratch someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I thought it was really interesting that Molly had surgery on her eyes.  I don&#039;t know if this was common back when Gibson wrote Neuromancer, but nowadays, surgery is not uncommon among Asian women (Japanese, Koreans and Chinese).  Many undergo plastic surgery to get larger &quot;double eyelids&quot; (an effort to assimilate with Western culture...?  Japanese magazines even have tips on how to apply makeup so that Asian eyes will look more like Caucasian ones).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Who else thinks Molly is a J.A.M.F.?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gibson&#039;s Mysteries</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/61</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the oddest books I have read...Neuromancer was a swirling melting pot of futuristic visions and stereotypes, having connotations in the area of future politics, the role of women, and the overall predictions for the future world.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I found that the novel caused me to ask more questions than it attempted to answer...the first off being what Linda&#039;s role is supposed to be not only in the context of the book, but also in Wintermute/Neuromancer&#039;s plot.  I could sense the obvious connection Case had with her, but I really couldn&#039;t tell how truly attached he was to her from the start.  Certainly he could have had a nice life with her, but was that actually in his mind beforehand?  Did he ever intend to &quot;get together&quot; with her?  And even more puzzling is how her face popping up now and again seems to haunt him, despite little evidence that Case was really attracted to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More puzzling to me were the actions of the AI&#039;s, as even after reading it and skimming over the book again...I can&#039;t understand what the motives were of Wintermute and what the intended results were.  I suppose these were intended to be....sort of...beyond our knowledge as humans, but it still leaves me hanging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good read, but it&#039;s left my mind swirling for quite a while with the mysteries it leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Brain/Body Brawl</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/60</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most preeminent theme in William Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is the conflict between body and mind.  In the futuristic world presented, those specializing in tasks of the mind are given a special status among the rest of society.  These elite are known as &quot;cowboys,&quot; specially trained and skilled individuals who are able to comprehend and even manipulate the workings of cyberspace, essentially a more developed form of the modern internet.  The protagonist, Case, is one of these cowboys, and his path through the novel, along with the paths of several other characters, greatly illustrates this duality of mind and body and the conflict inherent between the two.&lt;br /&gt;
The prevailing notion given by the book is that the mind is stronger and more important than the body.  We see this first in the protagonist, Case, one of the elite cowboys of the time.  The majority of his life is spent not in the corporal realm, but rather in the digital world of cyberspace, an area where thought processes and logic rule over all.  Such an existence leads to a specific mind frame, and for Case, &quot;as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh.  The body was meat,&quot; (6).  As such, Case and other cowboys attempt to deny the flesh as much as possible, focusing entirely upon the growth and expansion of the mind.  Case himself describes how, as he delves deeper and deeper into cyberspace, loses his connection to the physical world: &quot;Its rainbow pixel maze was the first thing he saw when he woke.  He&#039;d go straight to the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in.  He was cutting it.  He was working.  He lost track of days,&quot; (59).  At points, Case is able to completely deny his flesh and continue the existence of his mind within Cyberspace, thanks to the intervention of an AI called Wintermute.  Case holds a conference with Wintermute, learning what is really going on and who is running the show, and when he comes out, he wakens to the conversation: &quot; &#039;It&#039;s cool,&#039; Molly said.  &#039;It&#039;s just okay.  It&#039;s something these guys do, is all.  Like, he wasn&#039;t dead, and it was only a few secondsâ€¦.&#039; &#039;I saw th&#039; screen, EEG readin&#039; dead.  Nothin&#039; movin&#039;, forty second,&#039; &quot; (121).  An EEG measures brainwave activity, and while Case had been talking to Wintermute, his along with other vital signs ceased completely, effectively meaning his body and flesh  had died, and yet he was able to continue on in the mental world of the Matrix.  Similar experiences occurred to another Cowboy and character in the novel, the Dixie Flatline, which is perhaps the greatest representation of mind conquering body.  The Dixie Flatline is in fact a cyberspace entity that is a reconstruction of the behaviors and techniques of a real life person, McCoy Pauley, who is dead.  Yet when Case jacks in, he is able to confer and operate with the Flatline as if it were the real person still, essentially meaning that the Flatline has achieved life beyond the existence of the body.  It is revealed, however, that the mind is not truly independent of the body.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer also has its share of examples in which the mind still relies upon a physical operator.  The crew of the novel includes a street samurai named Molly, essentially the inverse of Case.  Molly is the brawn of the operation, doing physical break-ins and theft.  She becomes Case&#039;s link to the corporal when a simstim switch is installed to his deck and her body, a link that allows his consciousness to co-occupy her body.  He describes the experience as an &quot;abrupt jolt into other fleshâ€¦ her body language was disorienting, her style foreignâ€¦ she slid a hand into her jacket, a fingertip circling a nipple under warm silk.  The sensation made him catch his breath,&quot; (56).  Despite using Cyberspace to escape from his body, he is drawn back into the physical world through the simstim link contained within cyberspace.  Perhaps the greatest example of the reliancy of mind upon body involves the relationship between Wintermute and Armitage/Corto.  Wintermute is an AI, arguably making it entirely a logical and mental entity with essentially no physical existence.  However, to achieve its goals and plans, it has to enlist the help of a physical being, Colonel Corto, and creates a new personality called Armitage within the earthly shell that is Corto.  Armitage allows Wintermute to communicate with the various members of the crew without them having to be in Cyberspace, along with conducting business and other logistical arrangements necessary for the evolution of Wintermute.  Without this being, Wintermute would have had difficulting getting Case to join as the cowboy of the operation, for Case had lost all cyberspace capabilities until Armitage, under the control of Wintermute, arranged for surgeons to restore Case&#039;s necessary brain functions.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer is in the end a novel of the evolution of a mind (Wintermute) into a supermind, and as is expected, a large part of the novel focuses on the superiority of logic and mental capabilities over the physical body.  However, it also acknowledges that the body is often necessary as a support to the mind, and very few mental entities are able to transcend this reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/54</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just an entry in response to some of the comments made in class today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting that the new machismo in Neuromancer could be conveyed through &quot;non-badassness.&quot;  When we discussed ST last week, someone had brought up the fact that Johnny was feminized through his relationship with Flores (additionally, the movie version of Dizzy was also a very masculine female).  I thought that the relationship between Molly and Case was similar in the gender role reversal vein.  Molly is the brawn and Case is the brain (mind/body relationship?).  Furthermore, in conjunction with the Huntington article, Case is the atypical masculine hero in that &quot;Heroic and skillful action for Case takes place a the computer keyboard&quot; (137) rather than through sheer &quot;extraordinary athleticism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Some thoughts on Neuromancer, more.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/50</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It took about two-three chapters, but I realized that I had already read Neuromancer before.  I finished the book, and I enjoyed it.  Both the first and second readings were enjoyable.  But one of the things most enjoyable to me was just like in Starship Troopers, and a number of other great Sci-Fi books, things happen behind the novel that prop it up.  Never is it said explicitly in the novel that there was a World War, or some kind of culmination of the cold war.  I inferred that from the Screaming Fist incident with Corto that at least some sort of conflict occurred.  Clearly the world is a much different place than otherwise it should be.  This kind of thing makes me enjoy a novel more, because I can imagine a sequence of events that could lead to the events of the novel.  The extension of BosWash into BAMA, the sprawl, isn&#039;t even that hard to imagine, and does seem to be the way the megalopolis is headed.  Lax laws in space could lead to something along the lines of Freeside, where laws can be taken on by the owners rather than some sort of governmental entity.  This is sort of a segue, but it also reminded me of The Postman.  The Postman is one of my favorite books of all time, and also used allusion to great advantage.  Never does on find out what exactly happened to cause the post-apocalyptic world that the protagonist finds himself in, or what the rest of the world looks like.  For all the reader knows, it could be flourishing.  But it doesn&#039;t make that large of difference because the story does not involve anything out.  Both, or even all three stories, decide to focus on one person and leave out a lot of information that would be informative, but not necessary to the story.  It lets the reader fill in the holes.  That is my favorite kind of book.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Entertainment in Night City</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/46</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#039;ve noticed in many more recent sci-fi and other-genre works detailing near futures of our world is the tendency for some of humanity&#039;s most animalistic and basic (as in low) behaviors to become much more widely accepted and popularized.  In the Neuromancer, we have the entirety of Night City essentially run on illegal trade of drugs, data, sex, and other blackmarket operations and goods. Sure, most of it is justified by Case as &quot;a deliberately unsupervised playground for technology itself,&quot; for new medical procedures, cybernetics, and other such inventions to be field tested without regard to regulatory action, but much of the business is extraneous to this.  I&#039;m almost completely certain you don&#039;t need to field test narcotics and hallucinogens for legal trade at least.  The only form of sport even presented in the novel is a knife-fight to the death, which is well received by attendees.  It all just seems a bit chaotic and insane, especially in contrast to more classic idealizations of future earth civilizations where everyone gets along fine, wears the same silvery jumpsuits, and only worries about violence coming from an invading alien race that wishes to steal our well-preserved natural resources.  I feel that these depictions are very much a result of changes in political climates.  Starship Troopers, for example, has a pretty clear divide between the entirety of the human race and its bug enemy, and was written not long after WWII and Korea, times when we had a pretty good sense that we were in fact the good guys and they were the bad guys (maybe not as strongly in Korea, but still pretty good).  The Neuromancer, on the other hand, came out near the end of the Cold War and after Vietnam, which were very ambiguous wars, and things like Watergate, which caused much national tension, leaving many skeptical of governments and human goodness, and reflects all this in its very grungy, corrupt representation of urban life and human relations.  So I wonder, which future will come out to be more accurate, which future are we more headed towards?  I&#039;m not gonna lie, the Neuromancer model seems much more exciting and interesting to me.  And there&#039;s no way in hell I&#039;m wearing a silver jumpsuit regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
