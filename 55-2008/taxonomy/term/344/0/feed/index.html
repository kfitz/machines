 <title>Neuromancer vs. Pattern Recognition: Evolution towards Ambiguity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/315</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search revealed to me that Pattern Recognition, the eighth novel by William Gibson, was the first to be on the New York Times Bestsellers list, and the first to be set in a contemporary world instead of a fantastical one. The increased overall popularity of the more recent William Gibson novels ( as opposed to Neuromancer, whose popularity was more of a word-of-mouth cult hit ) may be due to this; however, speaking personally, I found the contemporary world of Pattern Recognition less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing about Gibson&#039;s work is that it is so incredibly dense and detailed, convoluted with tech-slang and computer jargon everywhere. &quot; Cognitive estrangement &quot;, as mentioned in the first week; making a fictional world so strange that it forces us to re-examine the way we think about reality. Neuromancer&#039;s early-cyberspace world does this with its advanced technologies and virtual worlds. Pattern Recognition tries to do the same. Unfortunately, Pattern Recognition takes it too far, by creating a world ( ironically, even more &quot; grounded &quot; in our reality ) that&#039;s so alien that the message is lost in its own convolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, may well be the point. Gibson may be trying to show us that the future ( which we are living in now ) is even more alien and disconnected than we ever could have imagined. But the narrative didn&#039;t communicate this to me as well. Neuromancer may have been talking about a profoundly artificial world, but it did so through a more traditional narrative-- a designated ( if not actually ) heroic protagonist on an action-packed adventure, who ends up changing the world at large. The characters may have been thinner and more cliche, but they were identifiable-- familiar &quot; cliches &quot; to ground very unfamiliar ideas. The cast of Pattern Recognition are more complex, but also much harder to define, and thus I think the power of the statements in the book are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit: Case is an anti-heroic super-hacker, a &quot; console cowboy &quot; who could be a typical video game hero. Cayce is a design-sensitive marketing consultant who explores metropolitan board meetings, club scenes, and hotel arrangements in an attempt to find context and understanding in her multimedia world. More complex, but almost paralyzingly so.&lt;/p&gt;
