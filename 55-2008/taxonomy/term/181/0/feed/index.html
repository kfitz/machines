 <title>Winter and Gender</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/148</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there is a divergence in opinion in our last class about the roll of gender vs environment in the qualities of the planet winter.  I just wanted to give a little bit of input about that subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that, while the harsh climate of this other world does have a significant effect on the people, the book uses the lack of gender as more of a differentiator.  For example, a lot of people seem to think that the difficult living conditions are what prevents war.  However, I believe that this condition would cause the exact opposite effect.  Limited resources have been at the root of most wars.  Where are resources more limited than on an ice-planet?  Instead, I believe the lack of fullblown war is a commentary on the male element in our societies.  This may sound like a cliched perspective, but I think that it is an interesting thought experiment, regardless.  As a male, I&#039;m fully aware of the compulsive emotions for self-sacrificing courageous deeds and posturing aggression.  These emotions are mostly irrational, but from just looking at the current state of political affairs, it is clear how significant they are in the public mind.  However, on winter, as there are no gender roles, half of the population isn&#039;t biologically programmed to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the tribe and their children.  Without this irrational undercurrent in society, war is never possible, because no one is willing to commit themselves to anything more that a &quot;foray&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
