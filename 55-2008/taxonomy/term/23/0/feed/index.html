 <title>Buggery in Ender&#039;s Game</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/88</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether anyone else read Ender&#039;s Game with Starship Troopers this semester--or had read it before--but I just read this interesting post on the Feminist SF blog--I was actually linked to it from Paper Cuts--about Orson Scott Card&#039;s winning the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which, I also learned, is some sort of important lifetime achievement award for YA lit. The thrust of the post is that Card is a horrible bigot and shouldn&#039;t be touted as a credible voice for young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a link to the post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot; title=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot;&gt;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&lt;/a&gt;. It has some quotations from essays and stuff that Card has written that are really awful and disgustingly homophobic. If you&#039;re interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, I thought, was this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;al Says:&lt;br /&gt;
January 29th, 2008 at 2:32 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i knew he was a homophobe before i read ender&#039;s game, but i still read it on someone&#039;s recommendation. i thought it was pretty interesting that the bad guys were referred to as &quot;buggers&quot; and that it found it&#039;s way to being a slur amongst the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, i know they were &#039;bugs&#039;. but there is no way osc didn&#039;t know what buggery (and buggers) was.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can&#039;t fathom how I missed that one. The phrase is so clearly sexual. And there&#039;s loads of (occasionally naked) homoerotic boy-play in the Battle School. Most of it more or less innocuous, though, which is interesting, given Card&#039;s self-professed beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s anything productive to be done with this in Starship Troopers--the word in Ender&#039;s Game is also clearly a reference to the bad guys in ST--but if anyone wants to take a shot at it, I&#039;d be interested to see what we could come up with, readings-wise.  We talked a lot about gendered readings of ST, but not so much about the potential for queer readings. Not sure how much potential there is, but I thought I&#039;d throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The difference between an MI man and a bug is...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/44</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m tempted to call this novel nostalgic, for all of its debatable purpose and philosophy.  Of course I wouldn&#039;t be the first to call it so, and part of the reason the jacket calls it &quot;The controversial classic of military adventure&quot; is the long history it has spawned of civilian readers being to some degree upset or suspicious of the almost fond way in which this future society of citizenship through military service is described; but still I had promised myself going in that I was going to try and find Heinlein&#039;s real philosophy behind the novel.  As it turns out, I&#039;m really feeling a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality from the book.  Is that surprising?  I think that even though you have characters like Mr. Dubois espousing the nature of the beauty of war and the enforcing of a moral system through punishment, sometimes Heinlein seems to be bringing out the very humanity he seems to find in such a system.  The first time I really felt this was in the passage, starting on page 80, that describes Rico&#039;s experience overhearing Zim and Frankel discussing their strong feelings of anguish at the punishment they had just ordered for Hendrick, and in the process describing the very reasons they had been forced, out of an absolute loyalty to the system, to act against these feelings.  Rico&#039;s response is his &quot;unsettling feeling that I had been completely mistaken as to the nature of the world I was in.&quot;  This isn&#039;t a passage the describes an undermining of the system, but rather a moment in which the main character experiences a epiphany about the significance and the actual (supposed?) underlying morality behind the value of adherence to a strict system for the good of the whole. Certainly Heinlein&#039;s career in the military (thanks Wikipedia) couldn&#039;t help but have informed this book, and certainly this is something that&#039;s been held against him by some critics.  As a civilian, though, I&#039;m as wary as the rest of you about such a rigid system like the one described by Heinlein (despite the humanity exhibited in private by some characters) in real life practice, and this book (though dated) certainly seems to try and nestle itself closely to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One classmate mentioned something about the tendency of Greek plays to include a character whose only purpose in the play was to expound to the audience about the philosophy the writer has attempted to embody in the play and his reasons for writing it to begin with.  Interesting to see that method popping up again here, in the form of mister (colonel) Dubois.  He doesn&#039;t just have one passage in which he seems to be lecturing not only Rico but the reader, but one of the most memorable surrounds page 118, at which point he begins to discuss mankind&#039;s cultivated &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals.&quot;  This is apparently the theory on which the entire society has been based, a society in which Citizenship (which means more than just suffrage) is awarded to those who voluntarily perform military service, and in which the MI are the most deserving, the most understanding of the morality they are upholding and the honor which they claim because of it.  Everyone, the recruiter, Dubois, Rico, Zim, Ace is proud of the MI legacy and seems to belong to a club of understanding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet there are the bugs.  They are unafraid of defending themselves, they are willing to sacrifice all in the name of the whole.  In many ways they embody the &quot;noblest fate&quot; described by Dubois, throwing themselves relentlessly into war and in front of their home.  And yet humanity, for all its rigid belief of sacrifice for the whole, does not recognize this. Sure, they&#039;re bugs, but if they were evaluated by the same system as the soldiers evaluate themselves, wouldn&#039;t their be something that would have to be said for bug morality and bug civilization?  Dubois mentions in passing that humanity is &quot;even developing an exact method for extra-human relations.&quot; (118)  Because humanity&#039;s method for inter-human relations is restricted to humans.  Yes, here I can see it: the potential for problematic reading of Heinlein&#039;s universe as one in which different systems of evaluation for different beings goes unquestioned.  How different to the beings have to be before they lose a place in the human system?  The &quot;Skinnies&quot; aren&#039;t anything like the bugs.  And yet humanity has put them in the same moral place: far away from itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>military and fascism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/43</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Starship Troopers is on the reading list for four of the five military academies is certainly not surprising.  The book is the story of a man who finds enlightenment through his progression in the military.  Johnny discovers that one must make personal sacrifices in order to be a citizen.  It is a privilege that one must be willing to die for.  With that said, I find it difficult to recognize any true change in the character of Johnny.  Yes, he is wiser in the military trade and can regurgitate what he has been told to be true.  But Johnny remains little more than a soldier.  He describes his experiences in boot camp and later in the Officer Candidate School and yet I don&#039;t feel as though the reader truly ever knows Johnny.  I realize Heinlin was not hoping for the reader to form a personal connection to Johnny but I did find the story cold and eerily void of emotions.  There was no time to make meaningful connections or discoveries â€“ there was no time for the individual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book makes great effort in marking an anti-communist stand, I did find many aspects of the society to have a fascist ring.  There was not an obvious superior race or religion among the humans â€“ countries joined together to defend their planet.  But humans did claim greatness over the Bugs and Skinnies.  The inhabitants of planet Earth believed themselves to be a more deserving species than any other planet&#039;s species.  I do not support the proposal that the novel is racist but the sentiment that humans are the superior species is clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s fascist underpinning displays itself within the classroom discussions, especially within the views of Mr. Dubois.  Calling Marx a &quot;pompous fraud,&quot; Dubois says, &quot;The Marxian definition of value is ridiculous.  All the work one cares to add will not turn a mud pie into an apple tart; it remains a mud pie, value zero&quot; (92).  One must not follow the rules of Marxism, what Heinlein would most likely refer to as idealistic.  In order for a society to advance, one must depend on the military and with that violence.  People in the military cannot consider their individual needs; they have to fight only for the progression of their platoon.  This is obviously a standard ethic of military services but it is also fascist on a grander scale.  A fascist society must function as a united front.  A human&#039;s needs must equate to the needs of his or her country.  The fact that only veterans can participate in elections speaks to my belief that Heinlein&#039;s utopian society would be one ruled by military and fascism.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Response!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/29</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So here it is, my very first reading response for my very first lit class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was reading Starship Troopers over the weekend, I found that I was rather surprised with the parallels between the Bugs and the people of the Terran Federation. There seemed to be this common need to put the needs of the group in general before the needs of the individual. This in turn, I found a bit strange because I was under the impression that Heinlein was opposed to communism which is almost what he was advocating. Anyway, there were two parallels in particular that caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first parallel has to do with citizenship. To earn it, a person has to put in their two or more years of federal service, in the military or otherwise, and only then are they entitled to vote. According to Colonel Dubois, &quot;citizenship isâ€¦an emotional conviction that the whole is greater than the part&quot; (163).  Rather than the importance of the individual within society, it is the society, or at least a larger group than just the individual, that matters. This is, apparently, even mathematically provable according to Juan&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy class. &quot;All correctâ€¦ moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level -- as in a father who dies to save his children&quot; he says (185). The greater good being more important than that of the individual seems to be true of the Bugs as well, although they don&#039;t ever question these actions. Certain castes are simply destined to carryout whatever actions they are delegated. They are, in essence, programmed to die so that their race can survive. Interestingly, in both instances the behavior stems from instinct despite the two races being quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also leads me to think about the instance in which Juan determines that it is worth going to war to save just one man. This seems to counter the previous belief as here a greater group is worth sacrificing just to save one man who &quot;may not deserve it â€¦ [or] may die in the meantime&quot; because &quot;thousands of people get killed every day in accidents&quot; (178).  I suppose this has to do with the military belief that no man should be left behind, but the fact that it opposes what has been established as human instinct strikes me as rather interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second comparison between MIs and Bug society is to do with the hierarchy established by each. It almost seems at times that the ideal MIs structure is close to that of the Bugs. The people at the bottom have their orders and are expected to carry them out, if not, they run the chance of suffering the same fate as the Third Lieutenant who fought in the Napoleonic Wars, who &quot;was tried for `deserting his post of duty as commanding officer in the presence of the enemy.&#039; Convicted. Cashiered&quot; even though he had been trying to save his commanding officer (194).  The worker Bugs on the other hand are &quot;hardly more than animate machinery&quot; and cannot disobey and warriors are &quot;are almost as stupid without a director as workers&quot; (194). What the MIs strive for is what the Bugs are born with although both have an instinct to place the needs of many above the needs of few.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>WTF, Paul Verhoeven.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/26</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently 4 minutes and 15 seconds into the movie Starship troopers, and I am absolutely sure that is has the worst opening sequence I have ever witnessed.  Perhaps it is because I just recently saw Cloverfield, which went a little too far down the documentary/shaky-cam road, but the little sequence &#039;on the battlefield&#039; was RIDICULOUS.  Let&#039;s even put aside the fact that a trained soldier continues to talk to the camera even though a Bug has (not sneakily at all) come around the corner and is about to snatch the soldier up in his semi-CGI, animatronic-looking maw.  Let&#039;s put aside the fact that the soldier takes time to shout over the sound of gunfire and comment, in melodramatic terms, on the aesthetics of the planet he&#039;s landed on.  We are evidently supposed to believe that the camera is being held by someone on the news crew, unarmed.  SO WHAT IS HE DOING??  The Bug comes roaring around a rock and bites a few soldiers in half, and he just stands there, evidently intelligent enough to aim the camera into the action but not intelligent enough to remove himself to a safer location (namely not one within arm&#039;s-length of the Bug).  He also has the steadiest hand I have ever seen, capable of smoothly swinging from Bug to shouting soldiers and back again.  He can apparently do this even while running; perhaps this is why he appears to be moving no faster than a brisk trot.  Once this faceless, brainless camera man has been put out of his misery by the Bug, his camera falls to the ground, allowing Rico to crawl toward it, his blindingly white teeth clenched prettily in pain and his eyes still open slightly, as if he is checking to make sure that he is still in frame so his bravery can be appropriately documented.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that came out more like a rant than I intended.  I apologize.  Please look to &#039;to whitewash or not to whitewash&#039; for a more measured and rational example of my response to Starship Troopers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bugs in Starship Troopers as Nature, not Race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that it&#039;s a common trope in science fiction for ideas about divisions of race to be transplanted to racial boundaries â€“ as if the authors are saying, &quot;Look, if they can get along with wookies, why can&#039;t we humans all get along among ourselves?&quot; It&#039;s such a common device, in fact, that it becomes difficult to recognize when alien species are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent ethnicities. However, the Bugs from &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; may actually be something different â€“ for lack of a better term, I&#039;ll describe their presence as a force of Nature, not Race (with a capital R) in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the relationship between the humans of the Terran Federation and the Bugs doesn&#039;t resemble racial conflict â€“ the only interactions between the two are acts of destruction. Historically, racial conflict doesn&#039;t take the form of immediate, all-out war: the Europeans and American Indians were able to participate in trade and exchange of ideas before prejudice and hatred built up to cause the two sides to begin fighting each other; trade in slaves from Africa was facilitated at least by the cooperation of some leaders within that continent; even the American Civil War was not fought as a battle of &quot;black versus white&quot; at all. However, in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;, the two sides are not just completely at odds with each other militarily: the Terran Federation &quot;[understands] [the Bugs] as little as [it] [understands] termites&quot; (222). The Terran Federation doesn&#039;t even have the faintest idea what the Bugs&#039; motivation is for fighting or when it might be possible to declare peace â€“ they don&#039;t even really know how bugs live, other than the very basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bugs and the humans appears most obviously in Johnny&#039;s proof about war as a cause of population pressure: &quot;Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us outâ€“because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate&quot; (186). This begins to resemble the conflict between American Indians and Europeans, but in the case of the American Indians, as members of the same species, they ended up becoming somewhat mixed in with the European population that invaded â€“ no such thing is possible (as far as we can see) with the Bugs. The conflict is meant to be seen in a similar situation as that of the &quot;retarded&quot; wildlife of Sanctuary - &quot;When types that had evolved on a planet enjoying high radiation and fierce competition were introduced, the native stuff was outclassed&quot; (155). The humans and the Bugs in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t communicate, they don&#039;t intermarry and they certainly don&#039;t hold Thanksgiving dinners together before killing each other: they&#039;re opposing species from different environments, and when they come into conflict, it&#039;s kill or be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So a couple thoughts on Heinlein. First of all, although I agree with the below comment that alien races can imply racial connotations, I think that in this case Heinlein used the communal properties of an insectoid race to demonstrate the potential power of a communist social structure in a species adapted to it--and to show it&#039;s fundamental incompatibility with human drives. Second, I think Heinlein&#039;s discussion of the source of political power, though not directly involving race or gender as a major factor, is a potentially useful tool for understanding modern political power relations.&lt;/p&gt;
