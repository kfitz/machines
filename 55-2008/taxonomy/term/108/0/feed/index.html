 <title>oryx and crake vs. handmaid&#039;s tale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/362</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since both of these novels are by Atwood, I immediately began noticing similarities (and more often, differences) between them when I started reading Oryx and Crake. The two greatest similarities seem to be: the meandering narrative style, which is not my personal cup of tea but is certainly better than being dry and dull; and the overall dystopian viewpoints of the books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Handmaid&#039;s Tale, religious extremism is the big &quot;Thing&quot; that has moved the world from contentment into despair; and the most destructive product of that fanaticism is the subjugation of women. In Oryx and Crake, it seems that scientific development is the big evil at first; but when you look below the surface I think it&#039;s really corporate control OF science that it&#039;s trying to criticize. The Crakers themselves, with their &quot;perfected&quot; human genetic composition and general plasticity, seem to be the biggest example of this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crake is a negative personification of the ideal of progress...or rather he is what happens when someone gets too strongly behind the idea of always moving forward. While walking around Watson-Crick, he keeps pointing out different technologies and saying &quot;wave of the future&quot; or &quot;the latest&quot;I found it so interesting that Crake is also basically programmed with a disrespect for life by playing violent video games, watching live executions, and another called &quot;Extinctathon&quot;, which while it doesn&#039;t directly contribute to mistreating the environment, perhaps encourages it? Yet, I didn&#039;t find myself hating Crake; rather feeling intimidated that he is the future of our planet...the progress-blinded, drunk-on-technology non-human with no respect for the earth, or no need for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose one could notice that both novels are decidedly heterosexual, and do not really explore non-traditional gender relations, but sticking to a few strong topics almost makes Atwood&#039;s critiques more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided that I needed to take one of my freebies for the Handmaid&#039;s Tale response. That book just made me angry because of its terrible ending, and potentially frightened, because Gilead resembles what a freakish fundamentalist-Christian America would be at its most extreme. For that reason alone, I actually think that more people should have to read it, and maybe have second thoughts about pushing their morals/beliefs on others. That being said, I also already have midterms beginning. My first exam is tomorrow. Gah....: /&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s in a name?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/110</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The reader is introduced to THT&#039;s patronymic naming system via &quot;newness&quot; in the SF-specific, Huntingtonian sense. In the first section, we are clued in to the fact that something is awry in the book&#039;s world, naming-wise, by the sort of ominous catalogue of pedestrian Catholic school-girl-sounding names: &quot;Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June&quot; (4). (&quot;Aunt&quot; seems like a strange title, too, but there are other things to worry about for the moment.) This is then followed by the introduction of Rita the Martha.: &quot;Rita is in here, standing at the kitchen table, which has a top of chipped white enamel. She&#039;s in her usual Martha&#039;s dressâ€¦. She puts on the veil to go outside, but nobody much cares who sees the face of a Martha&quot; (9). Here, we find a recognizable use of naming paired with an unrecognizable use of naming, so that we know that certain names are used in the same way in this world as they are in our world, and certain names are used very differently. What, we wonder, is a Martha?&lt;br /&gt;
	In the same chapter, we&#039;re introduced to Serena Joy, the Commander&#039;s Wife. At this point in the novel, it seems pretty clear that the improbable name &quot;Serena Joy&quot; is a stage name from &quot;The Growing Souls Gospel Hour&quot; (16). In the rest of the novel, though, she still bears the same name, and there is never any attempt to delve into the matter further.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then, finally, amid this small amount of name-related confusion, we get introduced to the patronymic naming system: &quot;Her name is Ofglen, and that&#039;s about all I know about her&quot; (19). This is sort of a tricky way for Atwood to have gone about this business, since &quot;Ofglen&quot; is less immediately transparent than, say, &quot;Ofcharles&quot; or even &quot;Ofwayne&quot;--it is more than possible, that is, to look at the word &quot;Ofglen&quot; and see only a weird, quasi-Nordic name, without yet discerning the system and its purpose. It is also important, I think, that Ofglen&#039;s name is presented as an absolute fact--&quot;that&#039;s about all I know about her.&quot; Ultimately, it will become clear that to give &quot;Ofglen&quot; as Ofglen&#039;s name is to give a sort of misinformation. She surely does have another, real name. It&#039;s simply the case that the narrator isn&#039;t privy to this information. But--strangely, I think--she doesn&#039;t seem concerned by this.&lt;br /&gt;
The scene in the Milk and Honey store is the first time that real information about how naming is worked gets revealed to the reader. This makes a certain amount of sense, since this is also the first instance of significant social interaction. First, there&#039;s the revelation that places can&#039;t really conceivably be named in words but must instead be named with pictures--&quot;Our first stop is at a store with another wooden sign: three eggs, a bee, a cow. Milk and Honey&quot; (25). The naming of women gets revealed in a way that looks incidental--via gossip: &quot;&#039;Who is it?&#039; I hear behind me. &#039;Ofwayne. No. Ofwarren&#039;&quot; (26). It takes the juxtaposition of these two names--in conjunction with the already-given &quot;Ofglen&quot;--to solidify our understanding of what&#039;s going on as far as women&#039;s names.	This is exactly the sort of principle of &quot;newness&quot; that Huntington points out as in Neuromancer. First, the reader is introduced into a system that feels somehow foreign or different but that is not explained in detail. It works sort of like Kafka, in a way--we just have to accept the information given to us. But, unlike in Kafka, things eventually get explained, get reordered into a system that, while still unfamiliar, seems at least logical.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think what remains sort of disturbing or sinister about naming in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is that none of it is ever fully explained. The new system is never fully revealed. We never know, for instance, what Offred&#039;s &quot;real&quot; name was. (And even her patronymic seems hopelessly vague: just as &quot;Ofglen&quot; looks in a certain sense opaque to me, I can&#039;t look at &quot;Offred&quot; and not read &quot;Off-red,&quot; as in the color--the color of the handmaids&#039; dresses, perhaps?)&lt;br /&gt;
Even the &quot;Historical Notes&quot; section seems perplexed by the amount of information we get: &quot;She does not see fit to supply us with her original nameâ€¦. The other names in the document are equally useless for the purposes of identification and authentication. &#039;Luke&#039; and &#039;Nick&#039; drew blanks, as did &#039;Moira&#039; and &#039;Janine.&#039; There is a high probability that these were, in any case, pseudonyms&quot; (306). Far from comforting or explanatory, the historical notes further undermine whatever sense of confidence or normality we might have found in, e.g., Moira&#039;s name.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Nobody Gets Off Easy - In Support of Atwood&#039;s Feminism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/107</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first post on this novel, I immediately took the side of Luke, against what I perceived to be an unjust representation of men. I seem, as a side effect, to have ignited a flame war between RoseBlack, JackKerouacSucks, and the world. As a result of that war, in addition to the conversation that we had in class, I&#039;ve taken the time to look closely at my opinions on this novel. As much as it galls me to admit in a public forum, my first impression was quite narrow-minded, and reveals the basic prejudice with which I read feminist literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note to RoseBlack â€“ I think that one of the most detrimental effects of personal attacks in debate is the resulting difficulty for people to change their opinions on further thought without losing face to their attacker.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that I was strictly wrong in my first post. I still have little respect for Luke&#039;s character (though I no longer assign his opinions to Atwood). The narrator clearly loved Luke (Seeing the corpses of dissidents hanging outside, she makes sure none of them is Luke (33)), and in my opinion that colored her reactions to him, giving him a more favorable portrayal in the novel than he otherwise might have. In the first stages of their relationship, the narrator was the second woman in Luke&#039;s life. In competing with another woman, she must love more, love better in order to win the ultimate prize â€“ Luke. Because of this, I think, she is more willing to see Luke in a better light, even after he has left his wife. Once she loses her job, she doesn&#039;t go on any of the protest marches, because she must &quot;think about them, my family, him and her. [She] did think about my family. [She] started doing more housework, more baking&quot; (180). When Luke wants to have sex after she lost her job, she meekly finishes his sentence, &quot;We still have each other&quot; (182). She cannot seem to see him in a bad light, even though he does not resist anything that is happening to her, for the large part of their time together.&lt;br /&gt;
Even when he does resist, it is far too late. He has waited too long, been complicit too long, for his last gesture to make any difference. I would go so far as to say that the failure of their escape attempt is his fault. They lived in a society in which men increasingly had all the power (literally), and with that responsibility, Luke did nothing, until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in going back over my thoughts, I&#039;ve realized that Luke is by far not the only character to deserve scorn in the novel. In fact, his ability to so totally undermine his wife&#039;s way of life displays the complicity of the narrator, as well. She is very passive, throughout the book. She meekly follows the orders of Serena Joy, to get pregnant with Nick. She follows the summons of the commander, every night he calls her, and follows him to Jezebel&#039;s without resistance. There are many more examples, but these cases come after the advent of Gilead, and so it could be argued that they display only her post-oppression psyche. However, in the time before, she displayed the same passivity. When her job was taken away, she &quot;thought [she] should do something, take steps; but [she] didn&#039;t know what steps she could take&quot; (177). She is not a strong woman, by any means, and in being indecisive at that key juncture, she displays her willingness to accept what is coming, instead of face and resist it. She goes so far as to ask &quot;What was it about this that made us feel that we deserved it?&quot; (177). It is clear that her passivity stems from something deeper than the meekness ingrained by Gilead. In reading the novel from her perspective, it is easy to see the faults of others, instead of examining the way the she herself interacts with her world. I think that is one of Atwood&#039;s greatest achievements in this book, is to make the narrator&#039;s thought process seem normal, seem right, and lure us as readers into the same complicity and passivity that the narrator exhibits. The examples of Luke, of the commander, of the horrible things that men do, serve as a prod to encourage a deeper analysis, to discover the distorting lens through which the entire story is told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator is not the only one. I could go through the characters of the book, and find their faults, their role in the downfall of their nation. Nearly every character has a serious flaw, from Nick, who is &quot;indifferent to what I have to say, alive only to the possibilities of my body,&quot; to Janine, who submits to the other handmaid&#039;s blaming her for her own rape, and finally admits that it was her fault (270).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one character, in my opinion, who deserves commendation â€“ Moira. She has her flaws, of course â€“ she smokes, she constantly mooches off of others, she is overtly sexual, and doesn&#039;t frown on being a whore in Jezebel&#039;s â€“ but their obviousness belies the depth of her character. She resists everything that is done to her, and maintains her attitude even through everything she&#039;s been to before Jezebel&#039;s. Every other character in the novel has been subsumed in the culture of Gilead, and is in some way responsible for its formation. They exist in a fog of selfishness, passivity, apathy, and only Moira stands out in resistance. Even when the narrator escapes, through the fake Eye van, it is not by her will, not through her resistance, but only because she has friends in the right places, and they act for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Moira act for herself, but she brings good around her in everyone she meets. When she&#039;s escaping, she inspires people to take her in, despite the risk. In one of the only examples of actual organized resistance in the book, she is whisked toward the border by &quot;people who didn&#039;t like the way things were going&quot; (247). These are normal citizens, not people in power, and the proximity of their mention to Moira further accentuates the quality that women like her can bring to the oppressive Gilead society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moira is strong enough to resist Gilead, without the vitriol that the narrator&#039;s mother pours on everything she opposes. In fact, Moira is the feminist that Atwood believes every woman should be â€“ strong, independent, but looking out for herself as a person acting against oppression, and not a woman acting against men. And that&#039;s a feminist that I can support, wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Janine</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/104</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve found myself often mulling my least favorite character in this novel: Janine.  She&#039;s the only character in the book for whom the narrator expresses clear contempt.  While she may quietly deride or ignore other figures in her life, Janine is the only person clearly within limits.  Clearly, Offred is not alone in this.  The prevailing sentiment at the Red Center is to &quot;[treat] her the way people used t treat those with no legs who sold pencils on street corners (133).&quot;  Clearly, Janine is damaged.  The young victim of a gang rape, she&#039;s easily re-traumatized by the blame ritual at the Red Center.  Yet in this new world, where women are theoretically safer from attack, Janine is no longer treated with the care or concern that are currently afforded to trauma victims in society.  Her instability constitutes a danger to those around her, and thus, she is shunned and further harmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The manner in which the cast relates to Janine brings up a point that&#039;s been made in other entries: empathy is gone from this novel.  Where Janine would be an object of sympathy in another novel, here she&#039;s &quot;a dog that&#039;s been kicked too many times,&quot; and rather than creating a bond with anyone out of shared suffering, she must turn to the Aunts, or other authorities, for occasional validation.  Yet even her quiet, safe submission is reviled.  To the narrator, she&#039;s &quot;sucky Janine&quot; the one probably crying in the back of the Prayvaganza .  Even though our narrator is highly complicit with the Gileadan regime, behaving so well as to convince Ofglen that she&#039;s pious for months, Janine&#039;s submission is always more vile.  Perhaps it&#039;s her relative comfort in her new world that makes her an object of disgust.  While other handmaids have the grace to at least be unhappy, Janine seems to truly take pleasure in the minor privileges she&#039;s granted, like a pigeon conditioned to peck at a stimulus that only results in their receiving a shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janine is interesting, inasmuch as she&#039;s a character who really can&#039;t exist within a truly utopian vision.  She&#039;s so susceptible to any form of manipulation that she would unintentionally create, at least locally, a crack in any system she belonged to, unless it was so completely totalitarian that she couldn&#039;t receive any contradictory messages.  She&#039;s so terribly well-behaved within the Republic of Gilead only because the messages she receives are so completely standardized that she can follow every directive she&#039;s given.  Perhaps what&#039;s so disturbing about Janine is that she&#039;s so very well suited to the social system of Gilead.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ten seconds&#039; worth of half babies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/101</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This Margaret Atwood book, having such an intensely gendered agenda, is sometimes confusing to the reader and the author&#039;s opinions, as expressed through different characters, seem to mislead the reader as to her own opinions about feminism and a potential utopian order for the world.  Specifically, it was difficult to piece together exactly what her mother&#039;s position had been in terms of the protests and issues like abortion and pornography, although less so with the pornography as there is the scene where Offred&#039;s mother burns it.  At one point the mother talks about being called a &quot;pronatalist&quot; by her friends because she wants to have a baby and it is difficult to tell exactly for what reasons this is such a horrific thing.  Other places in the book other characters mention the women who realized the infertility problem and gave up trying, and perhaps this is the group that Offred&#039;s mother was involved with.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to cite specific parts of this book without having excessively marked up the text while reading, as the nature of the narrative is that it hops frequently between past and present in no predictable pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular passage where Offred is reliving a conversation with her mother stands out as an interesting set of beliefs about women and their place in the world.  The scene begins with a description of the mother being over for dinner around Offred and Luke.  A discussion of why she refuses to dye her hair is what launches the mother&#039;s tirade.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;What do I need it for, I don&#039;t want a man around, what use are they except for ten seconds&#039; worth of half babies.  A man is just a woman&#039;s strategy for making other womenâ€¦just do the job, then you can bugger off, I said, I make a decent salary, I can afford daycare.&quot; (120-121)&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly she has respect for men as producers of sperm, but little else.  As if to support the Commander&#039;s claim to Offred during one of their chats, the mother suggests that the feeling had gone from their society and any idea of love was the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Atwood uses the figure of the mother to play the stereotype of the feminist, the feared, illogical and outspoken feminist that most other women with the occasional feminist thought consider when denying the label &quot;feminist&quot;.  And yet even hidden amongst stereotypically hostile statements, the mother sometimes makes logical points â€“ or the beginnings of them â€“ so she is not rendered a completely ridiculous character.  Instead she could be a method for Atwood to deliver certain ideas with immunity, having a character like this to hide behind.  The reverse sexism is evident in comments from the mother such as, &quot;it&#039;s like they&#039;re permanently absent-mindedâ€¦they aren&#039;t a patch on women except they&#039;re better at fixing cars and playing football, just what we need for the improvement of the human race, right?&quot; (121).  This sentiment mirrors the statements made by men about women throughout history suggesting a lack of intelligence and a strict limitation to only a very few activities they may do better than men.  Considering the impression given by the book as a whole, it is still difficult to pin down where Atwood stands.  She does present this extreme feminist activist, but at the same time, belittles her in many ways and renders her somewhat comical.  There are many layers to the gender conflict in this book, but without more in depth study of other characters and specifically how they interplay in the mind of Offred, Atwood&#039;s intentional message remains somewhat mystifying.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>female objectification</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/100</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Atwood&#039;s The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is often described as a work of feminist literature there are no heroic, or even admirable female characters.  Instead, the cast of female characters serves as an inventory of all the ways a woman can fail in the context of oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
Serena Joy was an advocate for the return of &quot;family values,&quot; she campaigned for women to return to the domestic sphere.  If any woman should have wholeheartedly embraced the Republic of Gilead, it should have been her, but she is not happy.  Offred even wonders: &quot;Which of us is it worse for, her or me?&quot; (95). The only thing she seems to take pleasure in is abusing her power over the other women of the house.  She does have real power over them, particularly Offred, whom she can have sent to the colonies on a moment&#039;s notice.  She punishes Offred for stealing husband&#039;s attention even through the tiny practice of digging her rings into Offred&#039;s hands during the all-important &quot;ceremony.&quot;  Gilead causes makes her hypocritical and cruel.  Aunt Lydia did in fact wholeheartedly embrace the oppressive regime of the Republic of Gilead; she played an active part in its implementation and persistence as a matron of the reeducation centers. She goes beyond simply accepting the oppression, and actually adopts an oppressive role, and she relishes it: &quot;we, sitting in our rows, eyes down, we make her salivate morally.  We are hers to define&quot; (114).  Aunt Lydia is particularly repulsive in her active suppression of the &quot;right to&quot; for women, given that she herself is a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
Janine, a.k.a. Ofwarren, is similarly distasteful because of her apparent acceptance of her existence as a handmaid, even though this appearance is completely contrived.  Though in another context, we might forgive her behavior as a necessary evil for survival, here as readers it is incredibly difficult.  She supplicates herself at the feet of the regime.  She does so literally at the red center &quot;kneel[ing] at the front of the classroom, hands behind her backâ€¦ her red face and dripping nose&quot; and she admits, as to the cause of her rape at the age of 14 &quot;It was my own fault. I led them on. I deserved the pain&quot; (72).  Later, as a handmaid, she partakes in the bloodlust of the particicution.&lt;br /&gt;
Moira, at the beginning of the novel, is promising as a heroic female figure.  She escapes from the red center and becomes the handmaids&#039; &quot;fantasy&quot; (133).  Throughout her time at the Commander&#039;s house Offred fantasizes about the &quot;frisky&quot; Moira at large in the world, as a last remnant of the old world. We finally meet Moira again at Jezebels.  She is, in a certain sense, freer than Offred.  She can smoke, and drink, and have sex with women, she has face cream and drugs, she only works nights.  But she&#039;s not really free, she&#039;s a prostitute, but sells her body for only modest freedom.  She wasn&#039;t supposed to, as Offred says &quot;give in, go along, save her skin,&quot; we, like Offred want &quot;gallantry from her, swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; (249).  But even her spirit is broken.&lt;br /&gt;
The resistance of Ofwarren, our theoretical heroine, is potentially even more pathetic than that of the other women.  She&#039;s incredibly apathetic.  She spends more time making excuses than being angry.  She gives up resisting, to the point of being annoyed by Ofglen&#039;s plans for resistance, simply because of a small sexual outlet, in the form of Nick.  She, more than anyone else, has internalized her oppression.  This fact manifests itself in her descriptions of the world.  She illustrates the world around her in compulsive detail, her justification being that it keeps her mind from her oppression.  However, these descriptions show her obsession with the color red, it shows up more than any other color in her descriptions.  She describes the red of the blood-smile and the Serena Joy&#039;s tulips.  The smell of the flowers in the garden is red.  She comments on the dusk-rose velvet on the drapes in the commander&#039;s house and remembers the veiny redness of a leaf on the ground of the forest when she was captured.  For her, red is the color of her robe, representative of her definition as being functional purely on a biological level, representative of her adultery and shame.  That she should be so aware of it in her life shows how deeply she has internalized her shame.&lt;br /&gt;
Given that this novel is so often read as a work of feminist literature, clearly Atwood wasn&#039;t trying to show that women are weak or inferior to men.  Rather this pervasiveness of shame, and guilt, the fact that they all felt that they &quot;deserved it&quot; (177) goes to show just how debilitating subjugation can be.  An effective oppressive regime can cause even the freest of spirits to surrender if given a small chance for release within the system, whether that release is control over other women, uncertain sexual relief, or forbidden pleasures at a steep cost.  For this reason, the novel is just as humanist as it is feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Deuteronomy 22:23-29</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/98</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Context: On pgs. 278-280, a Guardian is convicted of rape and subsequently punished.  Aunt Lydia says that the &quot;&#039;penalty for rape...is death.  Deuteronomy 22:23-29...one woman was pregnant and the baby died&#039;&quot; (179).&lt;br /&gt;
Consistent with the other Biblical references in the novel, Deuteronomy 22:23-29 is conveniently condensed to serve the purpose Aunt Lydia wants it to serve.  (see below) The convicted Guardian tries to say something, but all he can get out is &quot;&#039;I didn&#039;t...&#039;&quot; (279).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bloodlust that ensues is alarming.  Someone else blogged about the colors red and blue (I didn&#039;t read the full blog entry yet, so sorry if this repeats anything), and this passage definitely has a lot of red imagery in it. The women swarm forward like an angry red tide and proceed to viciously beat the man.   This act of violence is easy to commit because they have dehumanized the Guardian; he&#039;s likened to a &quot;half-dead rat&quot; (279) and &quot;He has become an it&quot; (280).  Ironically, the Handmaids have also become beasts.  Offred admits that there is an urge to &quot;tear, gouge, rend&quot; (279), flare nostrils, and growl.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident reminded me a lot of Heart of Darkness: the Africans were thought of as animals; but in treating the Africans so cruelly, the white explorers dehumanized themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guys were wondering what that section of Deuteronomy says, according to the Bible (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bibleresources.bible.com&quot; title=&quot;www.bibleresources.bible.com&quot;&gt;www.bibleresources.bible.com&lt;/a&gt;, King James version):   23If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 24Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour&#039;s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.  25But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.  28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel&#039;s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Better Protected or More Oppressed?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/94</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously the central issue of The Handmaid&#039;s Tale has to do with the role of women in society, especially in the future, considering how much of a stark contrast there is between the world of today and the world of tomorrow portrayed in Atwood&#039;s novel.  However, to actually quantify and sort out the differences between these two situations takes a bit more thought and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we could easily catalogue the concrete changes: women cannot own property or have a job, and are thus basically restricted to the home...either as a servant, a wife, or a handmaid (in coarser terms, a baby factory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand are the implications that some of these changes have had on the role of women.  However, I think that the way women have taken the change...and how they feel about their places....is probably the most important topic here, because the novel can easily be interpreted differently depending on how the people involved accept things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime example: Offred.  As a handmaid whose sole purpose in society is to reproduce, it would seem to us that she as a person has been desecrated by the established regime.  In our eyes, she is basically used by people of power around here simply for the &quot;gift&quot; she has (if one can call it such), her ability to reproduce.  For anyone with an ounce of morality, this situation just seems wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is the accepted norm for everyone....even for the handmaids themselves it seems.  Or at least, the established society would make one believe so.... However, Offred tells us in subtle ways that perhaps things are not so beneficial.  She continually has thoughts of the &quot;old days&quot; back with her husband Luke, when she had freedom, despite never outright saying she wished better for herself.  ....Until, that is, Ofglen steps across the line, clearing stating her rebellion on page 168, and it is obvious that Offred agrees with Ofglen fully....and not just a passing &quot;Wish things were better&quot; attitude that appeared in earlier chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, it seems that at least some of the women do not enjoy the change in role.  Considering that the structure of society is advertised as being safer and better protective for women, it is ironic that the same structure would put them into an even worse form of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might argue that the society IS optimal considering the circumstances...but to me it does not appear that much, if any, benefit has come from the differences in Atwood&#039;s novel.  One would hope (and probably assume) that her intention for writing it was to promote gender equality or at least freedom...and not captivity as Offred experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>god, hollywood sucks at life.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/91</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that this was the first week the book and the movie could be so directly contrasted, the differences between literary and Hollywood conceptions of what makes a good story really struck me.  My generalized conclusion:  Hollywood is SO LAME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I found the widespread tendency toward inaction especially disturbing, but also the most relevant to today.  Some things Offred said â€“ &#039;I took too much for granted; I trusted fate, back then,&#039; for example, or &#039;We lived by ignoring.  Ignoring isn&#039;t the same as ignorance, you have to work at itâ€¦&#039; â€“ struck me as very true and real (27, 53).  Laziness, or apathy, or ignoring, is a pretty powerful force.  It seems almost plausible that the country would allow a force to slowly gather power as the population ignored it until it was too late, when it would slip fairly quietly into control.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laziness is not an enemy that translates very well onto the screen, though, so the movie changes it up, and destroys much of the story&#039;s power in the process.  That a country as populous as the United States could be subdued purely by military force, which is what seemed implied by the movie, is so much more unlikely (and therefore distant and safe to its audience).  Atwood constructs a scenario that one could see actually occurring; the movie is just a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, most people do not seem too pleased with the new arrangement; the second scene in particular depicts a forced subduing.  They are reminiscent of film portrayals of Nazi Germany, with soldiers corralling the undesirables into trains and trucks like cattle (as oh-so-subtle truck with the crossed-out label &#039;livestock&#039; points out) and carting them off to certain death.  The book distances itself from such disturbing scenes, making it easier for the reader to slip into the same apathy that Offred does.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the people fight what is happening to them â€“ they make the soldiers shove them around, they try to escape, they resist, instead of just standing around as this new totalitarian regime is built around them.  Throughout the movie, there are references to the ongoing war that indicate a more widespread discontent and organized resistance than the book.  Not only are the rebels powerful enough to disrupt fruit shipments from California and Florida, the handmaids know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the movie, Kate (she has a name! an independent identity!) is quite a bit more feisty, as well.  She is not submissive â€“ at least any more than so many Hollywood leading ladies are.  She challenges the commander, falls into an affair with Nick at an absurd speed, and even helps Moira bind and gag Aunt Lydia when Moira escapes.  She is a Hollywood hero â€“ she takes risks, stands out, does what others are too cowardly to.  Atwood&#039;s Offred admits she does nothing and is reduced to reveling in the power she has, &#039;[the] power of a dog bone, passive but there&#039; (30).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie gives her much more motivation to resist.  For one thing, there is still a sense of community among the characters; they do not exist in their own little bubbles of fear and isolation.  In the book, Offred does not trust anyone, fearing Nick to be an Eye and saying of Rita, &#039;Why tempt her friendship?&#039; (15).  Kate has to fear only the soldiers and the government they represent.  Just as powerful, but at least she knows who they are.  They don&#039;t hide as handmaids, wives, or drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Offred of the book can describe the Ceremony scenes with an almost clinical distance. &#039;Below [my skirt] the Commander is fucking.  What he is fucking is the lower part of my bodyâ€¦rape [doesn&#039;t] cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven&#039;t signed on for&#039; (121).  The Ceremony of the film reads much more like a rape scene, with Kate crying loudly though most of the first one, and the Commander is sort of a lecherous old man â€“ easy to hate him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film, her life is bad enough, and her motivation (finding her daughter) strong enough that NOT acting seems inconceivable.  The book&#039;s Offred is not in a living hell so much as in a vaguely unpleasant place, and the risks of leaving it are much too high.  Inaction is much easier, and it&#039;s a pretty steep and short slope from inaction to apathy to acceptance.  Atwood&#039;s world is a much scarier, and much realer, place.  Hollywood cannot deal with anything less than five steps removed from reality.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Red &amp; Blue</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/89</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the biblical meaning of the colors red and blue?  I feel like they play some sort of role in The Last Supper fresco, but I can&#039;t remember what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In the vein of infertility in sci-fi...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/87</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in class, the movie Aeon Flux covers some very similar points but deals with the ideas of infertility in a very different way.  While The Handmaid&#039;s Tale deals mainly with white infertility in a single country, Aeon Flux addresses the idea of global infertility, not blamed on either gender, and the increasingly strict and regulated society that results from that infertility.  I feel like it was passed over when it came out, but I think it&#039;s pretty relevant to both The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and Children of Men.  Definitely more socially classified as science fiction as well with the presence of exciting technology.  It&#039;s also a really entertaining movie and I&#039;m a sucker for the love story.  So really no reason not to watch it, I know you&#039;ll all be dying to procrastinate at some point this week.  Enjoy :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Offred</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/85</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as I was toodling along and reading Handmaid&#039;s tale, I realized that I didn&#039;t know the protagonist&#039;s name, so I wiki-ed it.  I found it out, but hadn&#039;t yet gotten to the part with the explanation of WHY she was called Offred, so I just figured Atwood had made it up.  What I noticed about it was how similar it was to the word &#039;offered.&#039;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think this could possibly be a coincidence; Offred is &#039;offered&#039; to so many people.  She is offered to the Commander, as well as Serena Joy and the rest of the household, to Nick, to the Eyes at the end of the novel, to the larger machinations of the society.  She, as the narrator and representative of all the handmaids of Gilead, is offered to future scholars (and the reader) as a way to gain insight into the women&#039;s minds of that time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of this, she &#039;is offered&#039;; she never offers herself.  There is a passivity in this offering that is, I think, very similar to the one that she berates herself about in the time before.  Her little rebellions and transgressions, though they do carry a serious penalty, are ultimately pretty minor.  Whether it&#039;s laziness, inertia, the paralyzing power of fear, or something else, she pretty much lets everyone else decide her fate for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t mean to judge her actions or imply that she should have done something different, but she does let others offer her up with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Luke&#039;s Disgusting Response - A Rant.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/84</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the most viscerally affecting passage in HT was at the very end of chapter 28, near the end of the narrator&#039;s description of the fundamentalist takeover in the time before. In it, Luke responds to the narrator losing her job and all her rights without really blinking an eye. He still wants to make love, and can&#039;t understand why the narrator doesn&#039;t want to. He says &quot;We still have...&quot; and she finishes &quot;We still have each other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s entirely not the point. Luke clearly doesn&#039;t understand his wife, or respect her abilities, or have any sense of what his entire nation has lost by denying fully half of its population the ability to productively contribute. I know it&#039;s an entirely irrational reaction, but I can&#039;t help but be personally offended by the way that Luke just rolls over while his wife&#039;s humanity is taken away. I think that betrayal is worse than any other described in the book, and the fact that a man so blithely commits it is, I believe, a direct insult to men. It is that kind of anti-male bullshit that has given me a knee-jerk negative response to feminism, and I believe weakens the movement as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>thoughts on HT</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/83</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is different from the other two books we&#039;ve read thus far...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the worlds of ST and Neuromancer, there are still other ethnicities/races.  In HT, however, I didn&#039;t catch any inferences to characters who were not Caucasian. Gilead is a dysfunctional utopia.  The premise of Atwood&#039;s novel is scary and realistic enough: the idea that women, because of an increasingly toxic environment (mm especially since L.A. has been really smoggy lately), are becoming more and more infertile and incapable of carrying a fetus to full term.  The notion that this near-future society has reverted to a simpler way of life, while maintaining certain technologies is also an interesting concept.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m glad that Atwood gives the readers insight on the underground dealings in this world.  Unlike Neuromancer, it is not the scummy drug addicts who comprise the subculture; rather, it is those who are in charge and supposed to be great religious, rule-abiding citizens (mmm this sounds pretty familiar....Mark Foley, anyone?).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&#039;ve questioned the roles of females and males in ST and Neuromancer, in HT they are very much set in stone.  I think it&#039;s particularly interesting that in a world where fertility and procreation have become such an issue, the females are the ones who must submit to a patriarchal society.  Biologically speaking, women are more valuable than men (eggs are harder to come by than sperm, etc); if there are problems with impregnating a woman, in Gilead, it&#039;s never the man&#039;s fault.  Furthermore, when we discussed Neuromancer in class on Wednesday, someone had mentioned that it seemed as though the female body is revered as something beautiful, whereas the male body (ie Case) is this pale, hairy feeble body curled into the fetal position.  The Commander doesn&#039;t sound any better, with &quot;his white, tufted raw body&quot; (95).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional note, especially to people who have read Pynchon&#039;s Gravity&#039;s Rainbow:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;There is something powerful in the whispering of obscenities, about those in power.  There&#039;s something delightful about it, something naughty, secretive, forbidden, thrilling.  It&#039;s like a spell, of sorts.  It deflates them, reduces them to the common denominator where they can be dealt with&quot; (222).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did that remind anyone else of Slothrop&#039;s use of obscenities in GR?  I actually have the quote it reminds me of (is that nerdy of me?)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;           &quot;&#039;Fuck you,&#039; whispers Slothrop.  It&#039;s the only spell he knows, and a                     pretty good all-purpose one at thatâ€¦Maybe he&#039;ll sneak in tonight--no not at night--but sometime, with a bucket and brush, paint FUCK YOUâ€¦&#039;&quot; (Pynchon 206)&lt;/p&gt;
