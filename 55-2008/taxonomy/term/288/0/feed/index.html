 <title>Tank Girl v. Barbarella</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/248</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious if anybody has any thoughts on the similarities and differences between Tank Girl and Barbarella -- the fact that they were both originally comic book characters got me started on this line of thought. Both seem to be a fairly extreme extrapolation of a certain notion of a strong female character; Tank Girl seems to operate through violence and general social domination, while Barbarella is, essentially, sex (though with the numerous shots of Tank Girl astride her tank&#039;s gun, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some overlap between the two). Both also seem to be products of their time periods, Tank Girl embodying the punk aesthetic of the late 80s/early 90s, and Barbarella building on the sex kitten/Birgitte Bardot idea of sexuality in the 60s. The shift between the two seems quite interesting to me, with Barbarella being the idealized product of her society, while Tank Girl is completely detached from societal standards. If anyone has a more lucid analysis, I&#039;d like to hear it; I just wrapped up the movie and haven&#039;t had time to properly collect all my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
