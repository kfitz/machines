 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just finished the book, and I&#039;ve just got to voice my first emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE HELL??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the weirdest thing I&#039;ve committed to reading.  EVER!  The whole book the roll of the ooloi wasn&#039;t portrayed ambiguously.  You never quite blamed people for acquiescing to their wishes, because it was never exactly clear that the ooloi were truly manipulating their emotions beyond the human&#039;s control.  Yet, in the last 50 pages of the book it becomes painfully clear that the role of ooloi is to change the behavior of partner species in a trade.  There is constant reference to how the ooloi scent pacified the humans, and only minor rationalizations that the scent opened human minds to truth.  But, then what happens?  They start a new colony, and people are apparently excited about it, because of the advent of construct ooloi.  What does this mean?  Does this mean that the Oankali have won?  Have they effectively domesticated humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
