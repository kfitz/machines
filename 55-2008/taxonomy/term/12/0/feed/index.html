 <title>Reading Suvin 36 years later</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/17</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of Suvin&#039;s main defining points of the SF genre in his 1972 essay &quot;On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre&quot; is &quot;[t]he world of a work of SF is not a priori intentionally oriented toward its protagonists, either positively or negatively; the protagonists may succeed or fail in their objectives, but nothing in the basic contract with the reader, in the physical laws of their worlds, guarantees either&quot; (378).  While I realize Suvin isn&#039;t speaking to the sci fi tv shows of his day or that would follow, I wonder how his definition translates to a storyline with multiple installments.  I suppose this works with written stories as well, though you don&#039;t have the added element of &quot;that actor&#039;s contract isn&#039;t up yet, he&#039;ll make it through at least the end of the season&quot; with the written story.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you could argue that Suvin assumes a certain immersion in the world, ignoring things like &quot;the book still has another hundred pages), but I feel a totally accepting immersion counteracts the cognitive estrangement and the bit about sci f that forces the reader/viewer to think.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is entirely possible that I am trying to take his argument to a far too literal level.  Part of it might also be that I can&#039;t think of any SF work where the protagonists decidedly fail--I feel like everything I&#039;ve read or seen has some element of victory and/or promise of hope, however bleak it may be.  Feel free to tell me I&#039;ve been reading all the wrong stories and/or am looking to pick an argument where there isn&#039;t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also get the feeling that we&#039;re reading this bit of theory at the beginning of class because, as we progress, the stories will deviate farther and farther from this definition...&lt;/p&gt;
