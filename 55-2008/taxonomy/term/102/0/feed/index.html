 <title>Despair/Religion in Cyberpunk</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/80</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed that seems to characterize cyberpunk is a constant sense of despair. When the limits of biology and existence itself are stretched and reshaped, it&#039;s not surprising that religious notions of the soul and higher planes of existence become less and less meaningful. Most of the technological advancements in the book seem sacrilegious in some way;  when Case is jacked into Molly&#039;s consciousness, there are two beings residing in one body, Dixie&#039;s existence demonstrates that human consciousness doesn&#039;t require flesh, and Wintermute creates Armitage just as effectively as the basic principles of biology created Corto. Some of the basic assumptions of human existence have been challenged, thanks to miraculous scientific development, and there is effectively nothing to look up to (did anyone find a mention of anything resembling a church in the book?). Blade Runner seemed to make this point a bit more explicitly (very subtle symbolism as Batty dies at the end, I thought), so I thought I&#039;d bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly religious imagery pops up here and there. Part of the burlesque replicant&#039;s introduction is &quot;Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent... that once corrupted man.&quot;, and Batty ascends to the top of the skyscraper to destroy the man who created him, after he has proved his intellect (the man happens to be wearing all white, for some reason). Blade Runner seems to offer a universe where Neuromancer&#039;s technologically-based demystification of humanity has reached its apex, and people simply create more people, building in a finite lifespan for good measure, and inventing a test so they can know who they are (interestingly, an &quot;empathy test&quot;, as Tyrell summarizes it). And once memories get involved, and the distinction becomes less and less apparent, the only separation that seems valid is the religiously-motivated one, that while the end result may be the same, the way in which life was brought into the universe must have some bearing on the value of that life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs notes version: When the boundaries that are stretched in a science fiction novel are not physical and spatial (spaceships, faster-than-light travel, etc.), but biological and existential, you&#039;re destined to end up with some pretty messed up characters.&lt;/p&gt;
