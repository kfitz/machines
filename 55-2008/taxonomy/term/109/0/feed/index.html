 <title>Luke&#039;s Disgusting Response - A Rant.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/84</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the most viscerally affecting passage in HT was at the very end of chapter 28, near the end of the narrator&#039;s description of the fundamentalist takeover in the time before. In it, Luke responds to the narrator losing her job and all her rights without really blinking an eye. He still wants to make love, and can&#039;t understand why the narrator doesn&#039;t want to. He says &quot;We still have...&quot; and she finishes &quot;We still have each other.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s entirely not the point. Luke clearly doesn&#039;t understand his wife, or respect her abilities, or have any sense of what his entire nation has lost by denying fully half of its population the ability to productively contribute. I know it&#039;s an entirely irrational reaction, but I can&#039;t help but be personally offended by the way that Luke just rolls over while his wife&#039;s humanity is taken away. I think that betrayal is worse than any other described in the book, and the fact that a man so blithely commits it is, I believe, a direct insult to men. It is that kind of anti-male bullshit that has given me a knee-jerk negative response to feminism, and I believe weakens the movement as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant over.&lt;/p&gt;
