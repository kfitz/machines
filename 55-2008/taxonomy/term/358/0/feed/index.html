 <title>Narration in Oryx and Crake</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/329</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Going along (sort of) with my response, I wanted to add in the idea of the narrative voice in Oryx and Crake.  Obviously, it varies from Jimmy to Snowman, but there are also moments in which another narrator supercedes both of the protagonist&#039;s voices.  Examples: &quot;So who is he to blame them? (He blames them)&quot; (page 67); &quot;Jimmy didn&#039;t envy him. (He envied him.)&quot; (page 250).  At other times, this new narrator knows things that neither Jimmy nor Snowman could: &quot;(Jimmy&#039;s dad refused to pay...he and the dentist had a shouting match later, over the phone.) (page 62).  At first, I thought that these parenthetical statements were simply Snowman inserting comments over Jimmy&#039;s storytelling, but sometimes they&#039;re things that Snowman really couldn&#039;t have known.  Is this just a goof on the part of Atwood? Or is there another narrative voice that only pops up at certain times?&lt;/p&gt;
