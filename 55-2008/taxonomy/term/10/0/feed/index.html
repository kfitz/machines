 <description>&lt;p&gt;Slow River was very much like a case study of a person, a comprehensive analysis of that person&#039;s life and what happened to them that made them into the person that they currently are. Nicola Griffith, in my opinion, was able to make Lore a very interesting and complex character. She was able to accomplish this in part because of the differing narrative perspectives in the   novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     One of the most prominent aspects of Slow River is the constant switching of perspective, from third person when describing the past to first person when describing the present. At first, I was kind of annoyed at this but I gradually came to appreciate it. This switching of perspectives has a powerful impact on the story. It manages to reflect the internal conflict that Lore is experiencing â€“ she feels like she is completely detached from her past, as if her past self is a completely different entity. Numerous times throughout the novel, she questions who her true self while rejecting her past. In one memorable passage, she is sitting on a rooftop, reminiscing about major events throughout her lifetime, when she suddenly steps onto a ledge and contemplates what implications suicide might bring: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was finishing the fourth can, I realized I was standing at the          edge of the roof. My toes poked over the gutter. One more step. No more  Sal Bird, aged twenty-five. No more fear about being found out; no more worries about dangerous people coming looking for me or Spanner; no more responsibility, feeling like I was the thin human wall between an unsuspecting city and an accident waiting to happen. It could all just stop. Here. Now. After all, Frances Lorien van de Oest had died a long time ago. (Griffith, 100)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, Lore reveals the anguish that her past brings her, and how it has disgusted her to the point where she completely rejects her old self. The retelling of Lore&#039;s past in third person reinforces this notion. Instead of Lore personally taking the reader through her past, we get a more objective, detached narrator which more accurately reveals the chasm between Lore&#039;s past and present. The differing perspectives give the novel two dramatically different tones and adds a great deal of complexity. When the novel switches to Lore&#039;s past and consequently the third person perspective, it seems like the reader is made to feel powerless, because we are observing from a distance and do not receive any of Lore&#039;s thoughts. In contrast, when the story changes to the present and we are brought back to the first person, Lore seems like an extremely competent and intelligent being and it feels like she is much more in control of her situation. Before, Lore was powerless and entirely subject to the whims of her environment; now, Lore is the smartest person at her work place and is constantly fighting against her environment rather than constantly giving in to it. Ultimately, I think this switching of perspectives is one of the more poignant aspects of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Poetry-writing program</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/150</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine from high school is getting press for creating a program that writes love poetry.  Here&#039;s a link to the online story for anyone interested, I thought the idea of mathematically generated poetry might open some new avenues for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a pic:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the story online:&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Y - The Last Man</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&#039;s a comic book series called &quot;Y - The Last Man&quot; that&#039;s actually pretty related to the topics we&#039;ve been discussing lately. But unlike Left Hand of Darkness, which shows us a world where the two sexes as we know them have been sort of combined, this series shows us a world where one sex just ceases to exist. &lt;!--break--&gt;The story is about an English major named Yorick, and his pet monkey Ampersand, who are (apparently) the last remaining male mammals on planet earth after a catastrophe instantaneously wipes out all the others. Here&#039;s the description from the back of the first chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 4em&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Unmanned World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/2469/ythelastman00132ii4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid #888888&quot;/&gt;In the summer of 2002, a plague of unknown origin destroyed every last sperm, fetus, and fully developed mammal with a Y chromosome (with the apparent exception of one young man and his male pet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;gendercide&quot; instantaneously exterminated 48% of the global population, or approximately 29 billion men. 495 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are now dead, as are 99% of the world&#039;s landowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States alone, more than 95% of all commercial pilots, truck drivers, and ship captains died... as did 92% of violent felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally, 99% of all mechanics, electricians, and construction workers are now deceased... though 51% of the world&#039;s &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; labor force is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 nations, including Spain and Germany, have women soldiers who have served in ground combat units. &lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt; of the United States&#039; nearly 200,000 female troops have ever participated in ground combat. Australia, Norway, and Sweden are the only countries with women serving on board submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, all women between the ages of 18 and 26 have performed compulsory military service in the IDF for at least one year and nine months. Before the Plague, at least three Palestinian suicide bombers had been women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, 85% of all government representatives are now dead... as are 100% of Catholic priests, Muslim imams, and Orthodox Jewish rabbis.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&#039;m not sure if the &quot;29 billion men&quot; statistic is meant to be 2.9 or if it&#039;s referring to the male mammals also exterminated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series presents a pretty interesting view of what would happen. There&#039;s a fair amount of comic-book-ized material, like the badass secret agent who helps protect Yorick, and lots of somewhat cheesey, somewhat witty dialogue... but it&#039;s good. Some interesting phenomena that pop up: the &quot;Amazons&quot;, a cult whose philosophy is that men were punished and that the world is better off; Congress faces issues putting itself back together, because the remaining members are overwhelmingly Democrats, which the remaining ones see as unfair. Oh yeah, and there&#039;s less sex than you&#039;d think, because as it turns out, Yorick is trying to find his fiancÃ©, who was studying abroad in Australia when the Plague hit - unfortunately, it&#039;s not easy for anyone to find a boat or an airplane after the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
