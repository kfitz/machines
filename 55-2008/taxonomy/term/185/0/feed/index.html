 <title>Crake vs. the Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/340</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we very briefly touched on this in class today, but I was interested in the parallels between Oryx and Crake and Xenogenesis.  Clearly, the biggest parallel was that the human race ends up wiped out and reformatted against its will, for its own good (or so someone claims).  The narration of both novels takes place at least mostly in the immediate aftermath.  The initial struggle for survival removes the capacity to act in the ways that initially caused the downfall of the human race, but in both novels, there&#039;s the suggestion that this fix is temporary, and the situation will degenerate in to what it was before.  This shows up through the reappearance of guns in Xenogenesis, as well as the overall degeneration of the resister colonies into violence.  In Oryx and Crake it manifests in the effigy the Crakers build of Snowman.  Crake &quot;programmed&quot; them through genetic engineering not to have the capacity to create abstract art, because he thought it was tied in to a tendency to invent religion, and then to wage war. Even if he&#039;s wrong in making that connection, the fact that they do have the capacity create these abstract figures suggests that he may not have successfully removed more explicitly harmful human characteristics.  &quot;Next they&#039;d be inventing idols, and funerals, and grave goods, and the afterlife, and sin, and Linear B, and kings, and then slavery and war&quot; (361).  Then the mass slaughter of humanity would have occurred for absolutely no reason at all.  Both books present the &quot;better&quot; reconstructed human race as transient, suggesting that the efforts to fix us are futile.&lt;br /&gt;
I think the most important difference between the two novels is what happened before the restructuring of humanity occurred.  Both the Oankali and Crake saw the destruction of the human race as inevitable, before it happened.  Crake make a preemptive strike and he wiped the human slate clean before it imploded so he could impose his own perception of what humanity should be.  The Oankali recognized the fatal flaw of the humans before the nuclear holocaust happened, but did not step in to prevent the damage.  They waited out the inevitable death and destruction, and then swooped down on the planet and performed their human reformatting, and which point they could present themselves as the saviors of the human race, as they performed their biological imperative.  They seem more like the vultures that plague Snowman as he walks across the newly formed wasteland than saviors.&lt;br /&gt;
So which is worse, the actions of Crake, or the inaction of the Oankali?  Both are delusional in that they believe they are acting in the best interest of humanity.  But Crake at least realizes to a certain extent that he may have gone a little too far.  He can&#039;t let himself see his own creation.  He put in an official standing order for Jimmy to take over if &quot;anything happens&quot; to him and mentions that at that point Oryx wouldn&#039;t be around either, suggesting that he planned his suicide long before the actual event (320).  Some form of guilt or uneasiness had to have overcome his megalomaniacal tendencies not to get the satisfaction of watching his children flourish.  The Oankali experience no such pangs of guilt, they are happy not to even leave any human akjai before Akin fights for that right.  And though they did not orchestrate the mass murder of millions of humans in the same direct manner that Crake did, they certainly did nothing to stop it.&lt;br /&gt;
So I&#039;m curious, who do you guys think is more nefarious?  Crake or the Oankali?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Post-Humanism, Part One: Experiences in the Class Thus Far</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/189</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me about several of the novels we&#039;ve read thus far is that their speculation is based on human biology; specifically, the attempt to alter and control it. In the past I came across a word for this; post-humanism, a nebulous and ill-defined term, but one ultimately centered around the concept of building better humans. There have been aspects of this in most of the books we&#039;ve read, such as...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Starship Troopers: The soldiers rely even more on science than any in our history. The M-I are not so much foot soldiers as pilots for their suits, the equivalent of a second skin that enhances their durability and movement. The suits are much more personal than any conventional military vehicle, to the point where they move based on feedback from the pilot&#039;s body motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Neuromancer: Practically everyone is altered in some way; Case is described as a wasted human body whose utility is based primarily on his digital self. Molly takes a physical role, but she&#039;s full of various machines, such as her claws and her eyes. And there are characters like Wintermute and Neuromancer who act sentient, but that are hard to classify as human because they lack any biological components. Artificial intelligence, but hardly robotic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and The Left Hand of Darkness: Much harder to classify as post-human, because they&#039;re more about the examination of sexual relationships than scientific ones; not mutually exclusive, but generally these books are more about exploring biology as it is than what it could be. Still, the characters are altered in various ways; the Handmaid&#039;s Tale shows an attempt to control reproduction ( more socially than scientifically ), and The Left Hand of Darkness has the hemaphrodite characters use drugs to accelerate/stunt their &quot; kemmer &quot; period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Lilith&#039;s Brood: Probably the most post-human focused of all the books we&#039;ve read, because it not only has humans being altered by alien technology, but the results of that alteration across the generations. The Oankali, with their biological machines, attach new genes that change the human body. Not just in terms of healing the sick, but strengthening the basic human structure; Lilith is the best example, as she gains enhanced strength, regenerative powers, the ability to interface with the walls of the ship, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand: I&#039;m still working through this book as of this post, but the fact that &quot; rats &quot; ( humans altered to have enhanced capabilites and removed free will ) play so heavily into it suggests that similar ideas will come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these patterns is quite interesting; I&#039;ll have more comments on the post-human connections later...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anti-heroes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/184</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This book made me think entirely too hard about things I am not comfortable thinking about - what is human, what is free will, do humans really suck this much, etc etc etc.  Now that I&#039;ve finished, I&#039;m still stuck thinking about it, but I am having a difficult time grounding what I have to say in the text, or even articulating it in something approaching a coherent fashion.  I&#039;ll give it a shot, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing before I start:  Regardless of whether the Contradiction would lead inevitably to human destruction, refusing to help humans continue as humans because they will eventually destroy themselves â€“ because helping them would be like &quot;causing the conception of a child who is so defective that it must die in infancy&quot; â€“ is a little like demanding all fetuses be aborted because men are mortal and will die at some point, anyway (532). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m really more of a fantasy than SF girl - I&#039;ve read more fantasy books, good and bad, than I care to admit.  Especially with high fantasy, the stakes tend to be pretty high â€“ set out on this quest to drop this ring in a fiery volcano or the world will end, journey into the mountains to awaken the dragons to save the kingdom, and similar.  (Side note: I know that there are exceptions â€“ I&#039;m running with standard structures here) The main character is often plucked out of obscurity, but because of one thing or another, they are in some way &quot;destined&quot; to carry out this task set to them.  The protagonist sets out on this journey knowing it will be long and hard, and the plot concludes with a great release of the built-up tension â€“ a crashing together of great armies, an epic battle with the evil lord, etc.)  The main character may start out as an everyman, but through his or her actions and words, it becomes clear that the protagonist is suited to the heroic lifestyle, so to speak.  I find it difficult to describe exactly what I mean, but hopefully this makes sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the science fiction books I&#039;ve read fit into this style, as well.  Some, like The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, do not follow this structure, but Offred is never set up to be a hero, never does anything particularly significant on a grand scale; that&#039;s the point of the book.  Lilith&#039;s Brood, on the other hand, repeatedly sets up a scenario perfect for the heroic structure â€“ the woman chosen to lead humans into a new world, the first human-born male construct, the first ooloi construct.  However, none of them are particularly heroic.  Though they never behave as proper, traditional heroes do, through smaller actions they manage to accomplish the same things.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of Butler&#039;s protagonists really is an everyman.  Lilith, Akin, and Jodahs actions are dictated by their own and their companions&#039; everyday needs.  It is through these smaller actions that they manage to accomplish such extraordinary things.  They seem less unusual, untouchable, and heroic, and more like regular people who were put in extraordinary situations and managed pretty well.  It is easier for the reader to put themselves in their situation, to relate, and therefore erases much of the the Oankali alien-ness.  It brings out the humanity in the Oankali â€“ or perhaps the Oankali in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Lilith never accepts the role the Oankali give to her as the shepherd of humanity, but neither does she radically reject it.  She just rolls with it, because either radical action is too extreme for her, and it&#039;s easiest to take the middle road.  Even in the last paragraphs of Dawn, she still says, &quot;â€¦perhaps the Oankali were not perfect.  A few fertile people might slip through and find one another.  Perhaps.  Learn and run!  If she were lost, others did not have to be.  Humanity did not have to be&quot; (248).  She does not initiative to become un-lost â€“ that is the job for someone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further rejection of the traditional plot structure, there is no real climax to the trilogy.  The final scene of resistance in the mountain village is pretty anticlimactic â€“ the people have been subdued by Jodah and Aaor&#039;s healing abilities, and when the Oankali ship comes, &quot;there was no panic on the part of the humansâ€¦it was a measure of the Human&#039;s trust that they let Aaor and me and our mates go down to meet the newcomers&quot; (737).  Even the last Human holdouts are defeated gently, by the kindness (and chemicals) of the ooloi, and it is questionable whether they are defeated at all.  They are moving on to a better life on Mars, but they are still behaving as the Oankali want them to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end is ultimately ambiguous; the last sentence of the book, &quot;Seconds after I had expelled it, I felt it begin the tiny positioning movements of independent life,&quot; has no real feeling of conclusion to it (746).  Rather, it hints that life will continue on pretty much as it has through the entire trilogy, and it is through little actions and normal people that change will come.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lilith&#039;s Brood Respose</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/180</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In class Monday and Wednesday I was surprised that no one brought up the biblical aspects of Lilith&#039;s Brood.  I know this a touchy subject, but there are so many references and similar story lines that I thought someone would have brought them up.  The easiest to point out is Lilith, who distinguishes herself in a religious sense both in name and action.  In Hebrew stories she is supposed to have been Adam&#039;s first wife, who would not submit to his supposedly male dominance (including during sex), and was thrown out of Eden for it.  Well, after this she decides to go hang out by the Red Sea, known apparently as being a hang out for all kinds of demons, and has over a hundred children a DAY with them before eventually being punished by God for her &#039;upstart, sinful ways.&#039;  Though this isn&#039;t exactly what Lilith is all about in Brood, there are similarities in the way she doesn&#039;t want to have sex with Paul Titus and is the first to really submit (however involuntarily) to Oankali reproductive practices.  On page 297 she even describes how the Resisters see her as &quot;a second Satan or Satan&#039;s wife.&quot;  I also saw a similarity between the first child she has and Mary giving birth to Jesus in that both were told after the fact, and it was somewhat unexpected at the time.  Both would come to celebrate their children, and both children (Jesus and Akin, and later Jodahs) would have some pretty unique ideas among both humans and Oankali.  Plus, who often left his Oankali parents and purpose to go wandering by himself before returning to spread the spread word of his recently stabilized healing and abilities, and briefly had a relation to a large water-dwelling organism?  Jodahs and Jonas maybe?  Eh, maybe a bit of a stretch.   Besides the names of the people was there any support that the town that Tomas and Jesusa came from had ties to Catholicism?  I remember there being a church in Phoenix but no mention of any church or faith in Jodahs&#039;s mates&#039; village past the usual references to &#039;devil Oankali.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>large blue men with fin ears = future enslavers of the human race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/177</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I watched a bit of this movie the other day, a 1973 French cartoon called La Planete Sauvage.  I only saw part of it because I got super creeped out by it, but the part that I did see was very reminiscent of Lilith&#039;s Brood to me. Humans are toyed with, what it is to be human is questioned, superior and uncaring aliens screw around with human lives, the whole bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you can find most of it dubbed over into English on youtube.  Watch it if you want to feel like you are on hard drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/maindetails&quot; title=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/maindetails&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/maindetails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First person alien</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/176</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Lilith&#039;s Brood trilogy, &quot;Imago&quot; is the first time we get a first person narration.  It&#039;s the voice of an ooloi, and therefore one of the most foreign to us in the world of the book.  This functions on several different levels.  It serves the utilitarian function of decreasing the number of &quot;it&quot;s in the text, making syntax more understandable overall.  But it also sets up a very interesting self-and-other construct, removing it from the societal and making it far more individual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, Jodahs is both the most alien and the most comforting character presented to us who has Oankali blood in it.  It is both Human and Oankali, and of a gender we have no concept of or parallel to within the human race.  There&#039;s this tiny part of it that is like us, but it is wrapped in so alien a package, thinks with so alien a mind, that it is hard to understand it.  The first-person narrative brings us closer to it, making it easier for us to sympathize with it on a level based in linguistics.  It is the only character we get to understand through its self, its own concept of self, as an individual, something that is very integral to our (the reading audience) concept of self.  There is an immediacy that is absent in the previous two books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have Jodahs as the first...mistake?  Throughout all three books, we hear all about how the ooloi perfectly craft magic little embryos that turn into the projected, desired offspring.  Yet for a society that seems so hell-bent on privileging nature over nurture to the point of exclusivity, it&#039;s interesting that the child gets to, in some respects, choose its own gender.   There is an implication in &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; that the Oankali constructs have far more freedom/ability to choose their own gender, and that, if they do not like their Human construct paired-sibling, they can choose to be of the same gender as the human construct, thus avoiding having to mate with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is echoed to a certain extent in &quot;Imago.&quot;  But in &quot;Imago,&quot; the human-born construct is the first one to turn ooloi.  Nikanj is torn between its own desires to have this same-sex child to help ease its loneliness, and the consensus of the Oankali, who fear this child.  At the end of the book, though, we find out that this is not an independent occurrence--there is another pair of siblings in a Jah village who are becoming ooloi.  &quot;This produced confusion among the people.  One mistake simply focused attention on the ooloi responsible.  Two mistakes unconnected, but happening so close together in time after a century of perfection, might indicate something other than ooloi incompetence&quot; (743).  This brings to mind several threads of thought.  One, when society is ready for something, it will happen.  Take Newton and Leibniz and calculus.  The nine different evolutions of the eye I learned about in high school also seems to fit in here (though poking on the internet seems to indicate that this is being refuted, and that the eye only happened once, and just branched like crazy).  It also brings to mind &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; when Dr Malcolm says &quot;Life will find a way&quot; and *poof* the dinosaurs start morphing genders so they can reproduce.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find most striking about this dual evolution of ooloi constructs, though, is that it shows a certain level of fallibility within the Oankali, who have previously been presented as infallible on the genetic level of understanding and manipulation.  They do not have the complete control over evolution that they like to seem to have to their &quot;trade partners.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we&#039;ve got these biological mistakes, specifically Jodahs, and it&#039;s the first person to speak to us in the first person, to have a true narrative sense of identity and individuality, and to offer us what seems like an unfiltered view into its mind.  With the human and the human construct, there was a narrator who could observe and speak for them.  With Jodahs, this is not possible.  Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Oankali are in their second consensus meeting, Jodahs tells the reader &quot;We represented the premature adulthood of a new species.  We represented true independence--reproductive independence--for that species&quot; (742).  In Jodahs, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  It has become a human-oankali-ooloi hybrid that in many respects overwhelms everyone who comes into contact with it.  It has a way with humans that wins over century-long resisters.  It succeeds where the Oankali fail.  And it can reproduce.  Until this point, even when the Oankali were reproducing with the humans, even when constructs formed second and third and fourth generations, there was still a purely Oankali ooloi involved in the process, controlling the process.  The humans weren&#039;t partners in a trade, they were subjects in an experiment, because the oankali still maintained ultimate control over the future of the humans, refusing to let a human influence penetrate the level of the final decision-making process in creating offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the three books, each begins with a birth of sorts.  Lilith is born into a new world.  Akin is born from the womb into the world.  Jodahs has a birth into a gender and adulthood.  The first time we hear from Jodahs, he is becoming ooloi.  Both it and Akin speak of the sensory perceptions, changes in taste and smell.  Lilith&#039;s birth is a gasping, a dimness, a struggle to see.  With each birth, there&#039;s an increased level of comfort with being born, a better understanding of what is happening, what is being experienced.  As understanding increases, the characters are better able to speak for themselves.  Lilith speaks to the Oankali, but they do not listen to her until things have gone terribly wrong, and she has proved her fears and wishes were valid.  Akin can convince the others of the necessity of an Akjai human colony without testing it first.  Jodahs speaks with its own voice from the first moment we meet it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making that which should seem so alien to us the only person who gets to use its own voice, the separation between that which is alien and that which is human is decreased, blurred.  Arguably, Jodahs is the most manipulative of all the people we meet, because it is human, oankali, and ooloi, able to understand both species, and to wield powerful narcotics, its mere presence winning its enemies to its side.  It should be the most repulsive character to us as humans, because it effectively destroys the resister urge, the desire to go to Mars and preserve humanity with its very presence.  Yet, narratively, we are put closest to it, made to understand it best.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t have a solid conclusion for this.  In some ways, this drawing in through the first person seems like it&#039;s meant to simulate being in contact with an ooloi, drawn in against one&#039;s will, desire, conscious choice, through subtle things like the use of &quot;I.&quot;  Like it&#039;s the closest we can come to understanding something that is truly alien.  Like we&#039;re meant to see ourselves as the alien.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Glad to be done with the tentacle porn...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/174</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler uses dialogue throughout the book to say a great deal more than one would initially interpret.  She uses the Oankali and their projected image of omniscience to convey criticism of humanity and our civilization, even in situations where the Human culture is not specifically under scrutiny.  Less helpful to the story is her tendency to constantly ram the &quot;Human Conflict/Contradiction&quot; down the throats of her readers, yet never properly investigating just what is so flawed in it.  Because so much of the trilogy deals with the indoctrination of Humans or the raising and educating of children, there is a lot of room for explanation to the reader and we often hear the same situation explained from multiple perspectives.  This method of getting information to the reader is interesting because it points out the contradictions the Oankali are responsible for and the subtle manipulation and destructive lies through omission.  Much of the Oankali deception is only a suspicion until the third book, where the reader gets a very in depth view into Jodahs&#039; reality and how he twists people to match his will.  The concept of love in these inter-species relationships is completely dismissed, Lilith herself even says at one point that it&#039;s only a matter of pheromones, and that becomes absolute fact when we experience Jodahs&#039; perspective.  As far as Jodahs and Aaor were concerned it seemed not to matter at all which pair of Humans were chosen as mates, just that they found two warm bodies of roughly the right age.  Love is occasionally mentioned, but quite frankly it seems to exist more to point out just how ridiculous that concept is with the degree of control the Oankali and constructs have over the Human perception of reality, than as any kind of serious statement.&lt;br /&gt;
	One passage of Adulthood Rites that really stood out as saying more than it seems was when Akin and Tiikuchahk were on the shuttle to Chkahichdahk with Dichaan.  Dichaan allowed Akin to &quot;taste the ship&#039;s perceptions&quot; and then offered to do the same with Tiikuchahk (444).  Tiikuchahk asks its sibling whether or not it should also have this experience, as it had clearly been painful to Akin and it is Akin&#039;s response that is interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.  &quot;Do it.  It hurts, and you won&#039;t like it, but there&#039;s something more in it than pain, something you won&#039;t feel until afterward.  I think maybeâ€¦maybe it&#039;s a shadow of the way it will be for us when we&#039;re adult and able to perceive directly.  It&#039;s worth what it costs, worth reaching for.&quot; (444)&lt;br /&gt;
This passage not only answers Tiikuchahk, but also answers how the Oankali, and constructs who are sufficiently swayed by the Oankali way, feel about hybridizing humanity.  From their perspective Humans should breed with them, sign over their free will and reproductive abilities.  It will hurt.  They will go against their better judgment and resent their own weakness â€“ not realizing just how little choice they had in the first place.  But the Oankali and constructs are convinced that the trade is the correct choice and in the end the Humans will understand that the preservation of even the remotest slice of humanity is worth losing all trace of what Humans had once been.  Even though Oankali explain throughout the book their reasons for the trade, their efforts to make Humans happy and save them from extinction, this passage seems to offer clarity of opinion that seems different from the more outright declarations in the book.  For some reason this statement, that is not even about directly about Humans, explains the essence of the Oankali reason for continuing to force themselves on humankind against their wishes because of a belief that the pain is &quot;worth what it costs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>something funny</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/171</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just realized why Octavia Butler wrote Imago in the first person.  It is ridiculously hard to write a compelling sentence about Jodahs, when you constantly have to refer to it as &quot;it&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Aliens Like Shakespeare, Too</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/170</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As a humanist leech, I sometimes feel left out of certain SF authors&#039; visions of the future. In Starship Troopers, disciplines like philosophy are entirely ceded to the sciences--viz. the constant references to &quot;mathematically verifiable moral truths.&quot; And this is to say nothing of the uses of mimetic representation--a curious absence, given that such visions of the future are made via a sort of mimetic representation. We talked in class about whether there was art on Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness. In Lilith&#039;s Brood, Butler explicitly states that there isn&#039;t art among the Resisters. This comes up when it gets revealed that, prior to the war, Gabe used to be an actor by profession. What&#039;s particularly interesting, though, is the way aesthetic experience gets linked with the tactile communication that takes place between constructs and Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Akin clearly has no idea what it means to be an actor. He describes the phenomenon of performance art in descriptive terms that turn out to be sort of alarming: &quot;Gabe had been an actor. People gave him money and goods so that he would pretend to be someone else&quot; (408). Aside from basic cultural miscommunication, Akin&#039;s objections to Gabe&#039;s acting look, at first, pretty Platonic. &quot;&#039;Didn&#039;t your mother ever tell you any stories?&#039; [Gabe] asked Akin. &#039;Yes,&#039; Akin said. &#039;But they were true&#039;&quot; (408). Here, Akin&#039;s idea is that fiction--or, probably, any other form of mimetic representation--is not a useful endeavor because its empirical falseness renders it a less good way to communicate between persons information about human-/Oankali-nature, the given world, etc. Plato, of course, makes this objection in Book X of the Republic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dovetails unsettlingly with the state of utter destruction that has been wrought on Earth by this time in the novel. &quot;&#039;She never told you about the three bears?&#039; &#039;What&#039;s a bear?&#039;&quot; (408). This perspective shift renders impotent Akin&#039;s attack on acting as well as Gabe&#039;s defense of same. At a certain point, the biological mandate to survive trumps any sort of demands that aesthetic objects impose on us. Art pales in the face of death--or, in this case, extinction. I take this to be a really useful observation that perhaps SF authors, in general, are in a better position to make than other fiction writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabe&#039;s performance of Lear for Akin is described simply as a transformation: &quot;Gabe became an old man&quot; (408). Despite his initial reservations, Akin has a powerful experience of empathic substitution: &quot;Somehowâ€¦he felt what Gabe seemed to want him to feel. Surprise, anger, betrayal, utter bewilderment, despair, madnessâ€¦.&quot; (408). A wide range of the human experience suddenly becomes available to Akin, and he experiences it immanently. It&#039;s an incredible fact about art that it can make subjective experience communicable between persons; that it should also do this between species says something about the real (potential) power of representation in the universe of Lilith&#039;s Brood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, when Akin attempts to describe to Gabe his experience as an audience, he describes it as being similar to a form of communication unique to the Oankali: &quot;It&#039;s like what we do--constructs and Oankali. It&#039;s like when we touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (409). There might not be a better way to paraphrase the purpose of art than to say it&#039;s &quot;talking with feelings and pressures.&quot; The humanist tradition, it turns out, survives, albeit in a semi-recognizable form. But that seems to be a theme in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Morality in Lilith&#039;s Brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/169</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We spent a large part of our in-class discussion on Lilith&#039;s talking about the morality of the Oankali&#039;s actions toward humanity.  They were described as immoral, amoral, devious.  What I think Lilith&#039;s Brood shows us is that what we, as humans, think of as absolute morals are actually incredibly slippery and ephemeral things.&lt;br /&gt;
	The resisters reject living with Oankali because they refuse to mate with the Oankali, regardless of the pleasure it provides, regardless of the fact that doing so is the only way that they can propagate their genes.  For them, to create half-breed children is worse than the possibility of never having children at all, to create constructs is unnatural, immoral, and the ultimate betrayal of the species.  They refuse to be anything other than human, regardless of what human means.  But as the years progress on earth, humanity seems to become something not really worth aspiring to, for no other reason than the fact that their existence is meaningless, and they know it.  At one point, Tate admits to Akin &quot;We don&#039;t get old. We don&#039;t have kids, and nothing we do means shit&quot; (402).  Eventually, the main characteristic associated with humanity becomes violence.  Men rape, pillage, kidnap and kill.  Even the more civilized members of Pheonix start using guns and resort to raiding other towns.&lt;br /&gt;
	The resisters hold so strongly to this moral imperative that they not only kill others, but allow themselves to die.  Many resisters with correctable medical conditions refuse Ooloi treatment, one of Akin&#039;s captors would &quot;cut his own throat before he let one of those things touch him again,&quot; even though they could cure him of the ulcer that kills him (328).  Since the Ooloi are so preoccupied with healing, they will, and biologically need to, treat anyone unwell they are presented with, and would therefore do so, even for a resister, yet none seek treatment.  They feel they must hold their moral ground, and this makes them suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;
At this point, their resistance just isn&#039;t worth it any more.  They may be avoiding betraying their species in their minds, but they&#039;re causing much more harm that the Oankali ever did, and for that reason, they&#039;re acting more immorally than Lilith or any of the other humans with Oankali mates.  Though clearly our biology tells us that it&#039;s absolutely immoral to allow the extinction of the species, if being human means raping and killing other humans, then trying to propagate the species is itself immoral.  Through this, I think Lilith&#039;s Brood shows that there are so such things as absolute morals.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>there is a fine line...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/167</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting oxymoronic concepts in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  Throughout the series, the Oankali mention that the Human race is full of life and death, horror and beauty.  Simultaneously, Lilith notices the subtle ways the Oankali treat the Humans.  Their imprisonment isn&#039;t actively aggressive, but it&#039;s an aggressiveness hidden in kindness.  &quot;And they had done it all so softly, without brutality, and with patience and gentleness so corrosive...&quot; (67).  Also, when the ooloi and the humans are fighting, Lilith describes it as &quot;gentle chaos.&quot;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trend I noticed is the fascination with pleasure and pain.  The ooiloi definitely have an interest in both pleasure and pain, and Lilith, also, &quot;perversely&quot; enjoys the pain of aching muscles (146).  When Nikanj induces &quot;time together&quot; between Lilith and Joseph, it is both a painful and pleasurable experience.  &quot;Now their delight in one another ignited and burned...They seemed to rush upward...&quot; (162).  This experience is soon followed by pain: &quot;Her first solitary sensation was pain--as though she had been shouting, screaming&quot; (162-163).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, I guess there&#039;s just a fine line between all these things, which could be an extension of the moral ambiguity we&#039;ve been having trouble understanding.  How much of the Oankali&#039;s intentions are for the benefit of their race or ours?  Is their philanthropy completely altruistic? We don&#039;t get to know what the Oankali really think, which is part of the problem.  Either way, I&#039;m still wishy washy on what I think.  However, Nikanj&#039;s statement on page 153 really captured my attention: &quot;We...do need you...In a very real way, you&#039;ve captured us, and we can&#039;t escape.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Somthing I was thinking about</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/166</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Blag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime I wish SF could be a little more realistic.  No, not the actual science.  It&#039;s either realistic or not, but I can usually get over that.  What I mean is that no one ever does anything boring in SF.  It would be a nice change of pace.  I mean, I have been up to my neck in work for the past two weeks.  But there has never been anything like that facing any of the main characters in most SF.  Never does there seem to be boring large amounts of work, or boring scenes. The closest you get in Lilith&#039;s Brood is where she is being trained to learn the skills she needs.  Even then though, Octavia butler skips past most of those parts.  While it helps maintain the intensity of the work and keep it flowing, I think it also divorces us from what Lilith actually went through.  Without even one scene in which Lillith is being trained, it is hard to form any empathy about her training, and the need to train the other humans in  those same skills.  The only author in SF that I can think of who actually pulls boredom off is Vernor Vinge in his novel Deepness in the Sky.  There is a scene in that book during a long space flight, and the author manages to convey the boredom by showing a few of the mundane tasks undertaken by the protagonist, while still keeping the book moving along because the tasks were useful.  In fact, the scene is a welcome respite from action.  Lilith never seems to ever pause in her action, and it makes a few scenes harder to relate to.  Especially after she was first awakened, it seemed as if she was always doing something.  Though it was described later as a very boring and trying time, while she was experiencing it, the reader only got the slightest intimation of hardship.  This made it harder later on to really emphasize with Lilith.  And that was a nice break from all the work I have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Genetics in Science Fiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/164</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After the brief discussion about genetics in class on Monday, I figured I&#039;d talk about my understanding of the genetics involved and how they would affect Oankali form and society. Although our current understanding of genetics limits our engineering methods to basically linking one gene to a single protein or trait, it&#039;s become pretty clear in the last decade that our genome is much more complicated than that--we are exponentially more complex than a fruit fly, for example, but we have less than double the actual number of genes that a fruit fly has. Clearly, although the physical complexity must be genetically derived, it cannot be purely explained by our current understanding of genomics. Given that, I think it&#039;s fair to allow Butler some wiggle room on the capacity of the Oankali to engineer particular personality traits--things like aggression, caution, violence, sexual drive, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
We seek to assign moral or societal values to the behavior of the Oankali. In particular, their drive to &quot;trade&quot; with species after species seems appalling to us; they seem to genetically pillage other species, imposing their own biological and societal forms. However, attempts for us to place a moral judgement upon that behavior are essentially inappropriate. This drive is a subtle, genetic one; just as we have a basic drive to reproduce on a genetic level, the Oankali enact this sort of genetic colonialism because of a desire, a need that is fundamental to them. To judge them for it is the same as judging humanity for seeking sex.&lt;br /&gt;
The differences between humanity and the Oankali are even more extreme than first appears. Although they appear largely human when amongst us, it must be remembered that their original form was closer to a sea urchin or jellyfish than an ape. Societal forms and moral strictures forming in such a different species would be truly unknown and potentially unknowable to us; the Oankali are truly and completely foreign, from a genetic level up to the extrapolated society, and we must keep that in mind when considering their motives.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>sexuality &amp; power dynamic in lilith&#039;s brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/162</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, I really enjoyed reading this book; in my opinion it does a far better job of presenting an alternative view of gender than Left Hand of Darkness did. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d necessarily want our civilization to evolve in this direction gender-wise, but clearly Oankali society functions quite smoothly even with a lack of duality. The message is that this kind of functioning is possible for us. Lilith&#039;s Brood is a feminist work in the best sense because it promotes and presents a model of true gender equality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the ooloi or &quot;third&quot; gender, who are both male and female integrated, seem to wield most of the power and influence in Oankali society, They take the primary role in procreation and are respected as &quot;treasured strangers&quot; (pp.106). The female Oankali follow just behind them in status, and the males are actually the calmest and most passive. Ultimately, however, an Oankali&#039;s gender is of little consequence; though ooloi, those of the gender that would be most unfamiliar to humans, are the ones specifically bred to work with humans.&lt;br /&gt;
The structure of Oankali society forces the reader (and the human characters) to confront and accept functional androgyny, and possibly even respect it. It is interesting that even with this degree of control and extra ability, ooloi are still called &quot;outsiders&quot;; perhaps to gradually get the reader audience used to such an idea? I&#039;m not certain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved how among the Oankali, sex is not demonized, it is embraced, and yet made very scientific at the same time. Sex is &quot;shared&quot; rather than being &quot;had&quot;. Possession has nothing to do with it; the experience is either sensual and about pleasure, or neutral and merely biological. The process of maturing sexually has an almost-sacred significance and is referred to as a &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. Oankali do not have a separate set of sexual organs; sensory arms are &quot;very flexible, very versatile, but only another limb&quot; (pp.110). Oankali do not struggle with sexuality and obsess over pleasure to the same degree that humans do, and yet, it is what they live for in a way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part of the gender model in this book that maybe doesn&#039;t work so well is the &quot;demonizing&quot; of the human male. I&#039;m sure that most human men probably would go a little bonkers after not having sex for months, but I doubt that it would drive them all to violence and total dehumanization of women in their minds. In other words, Paul Titus bothers me. It&#039;s interesting that the Oankali treated two humans the way that we treat animals today; put &#039;em in a cage and wait until they mate. However, what do animals do if they don&#039;t want to mate? They just don&#039;t! No killing or injury involved. I think that human men are being deliberately portrayed as &quot;out of control&quot; but it&#039;s an unfair generalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a conversation between Lilith and Tate Marah, the first woman that she Awakens, where many interesting things show up:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Who are you Awakening?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Leah Bede and Celene Iver.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Two more women? Why don&#039;t you wake up a man?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I will eventually.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;You&#039;re still thinking about your Paul Titus, aren&#039;t you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;He wasn&#039;t mine.&quot; She wished that she had not told Tate about him.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Awaken a man next, Lilith. The guy who was found protecting the kids.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;On the theory that if you fall off a horse, you should immediately get back on?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Tate, once he&#039;s Awake, he stays Awake. He&#039;s used to ordering people around. He can&#039;t save us or protect us but he can damn sure screw us up.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;So what, you&#039;re going to wait until you can Awaken him to a kind of harem?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Tate seems to be driven by typical female desires: the wish to be protected, and sexual desire. Lilith is thinking of the whole group and who will be the most useful, not worrying about her own ability to function sexually. However, they are almost turning some tables and treating the man in question like an object, an animal who would be unable to control himself simply because he is outnumbered by women. This is an interesting experiment to look at, but it is basically reverse-sexist, and probably wouldn&#039;t work so well in our human society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Art, Culture, and Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/160</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oankali in &lt;em&gt;Lilith&#039;s Brood&lt;/em&gt; are distinctly alien, in many ways â€“ but the difference which persists longest and is most troublesome is their culture â€“ or apparent lack thereof. The Oankali apparently take the view that biology is everything â€“ that, given the scale of a group of humans throughout a lifetime, the genes they have within them ultimately decide the fate of the entires species. They believe that they can predict the lifestyle of the children their ooloi mix before the children are even born. But this sort of dramatically confident view is also one-sided: it ignores the existence of culture, the influence of society, and what Hobbes calls &quot;the Social Contract&quot;. The Oankali perceive a predictability in humans&#039; genetic makeup that persists whether the humans exist in a &quot;state of nature&quot; or not. Granted, the behavior of the humans we see in the book seems &quot;nasty, brutish, and short&quot; except on account of the intervention by Oankali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also suggestions that the Oankali view is not all-encompassing. The Oankali claim that the &quot;Trade&quot; with humans is in part an exchange of cultural practices â€“ but it doesn&#039;t seem like the Oankali have a culture outside of their biology. They have no written records â€“ in fact, they do not wish for Lilith to have writing implements intially, either â€“ but instead rely only on their infallible memories. They have no tradition of fiction, myth, or lying. The closest they come to art is in the shaping of new creatures to serve their needs â€“ and even that seems painfully utilitarian. And even though they claim to be interested in human culture, they really seem to fear it. Take this episode, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:1em; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding: .5em;&quot;&gt;&quot;The music would soon either drive the storytellers into one of the houses or, more likely, bring them into the singing and dancing. Oankali did not like music. They began to withdraw into the houses â€“ to save their hearing, they said. Most constructs enjoyed music as much as Humans did. Several Oankali-born construct males had become wandering musicians, more than welcome at any trade village.&quot; (Butler 439)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oankali willingly walk away from human culture, ignore it as best they can. They have no use for it. The reasons for this aren&#039;t clear: but my best guess is that it&#039;s not biological enough for them. It is as if the Oankali&#039;s ability to perceive biology so completely blinds them to the worth of non-biological practices. Their ability to communicate directly to one another through sense-tentacles could be related: Akin admits that acting at least is &quot;like when [the Oankali and Constructs] touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (Butler 409). Actually, this description of acting resembles Ursula Le Guin&#039;s explanation of fiction as a method of &quot;describing certain aspects of psychological reality in the novelist&#039;s way, which is by inventing elaborately circumstantial lies&quot; (&lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, Introduction). So if fiction is a method for abstractly conveying difficult information, then Constructs should have no need for it, and in fact this is true. But at the same time, the Constructs enjoy music as much as humans. And even though natural Oankali are not musical, what the Ooloi do is &quot;almost like making music â€“ balancing endorphins, silencing pain, maintaining sobriety... Ooloi made great harmonies, interweaving people and sharing pleasure&quot; (512). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Oankali, then, biology does not simply replace art; biology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; art, and other forms of art are unnecessary. They do not partake in the trade of books and paintings, and they seem to scarcely acknowledge their value, even though they also claim that human culture is greatly significant. In the end, it may be significant because it is the one aspect of humans they least understand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>this was meant to be a respone...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;...This was meant to be a response to the long thread of comments on the entry titled, &quot;The extension of human masculinity,&quot; but it became this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to watch people get so riled up about gender in class.  I understand that some people believe it&#039;s a social construct and that stereotypes are evil, etc. etc., but I think that this belief in gender and the stereotypes attached to each one is so deeply ingrained, that there&#039;s no point in arguing aimlessly about it.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m maybe not going to make any sense when I try to explain this, but I&#039;m going to try... So in my Lit Theory class today (or yesterday, technically speaking), we were discussing Nietsche&#039;s and Frost&#039;s ideas on metaphors.  Metaphors are so common in our everyday language that we don&#039;t even notice them anymore (ie. &quot;She&#039;s a warm person.&quot;  Life as a journey can be extended to the statement &quot;I&#039;m lost.&quot;).  Ultimately, metaphors stabilize and give meaning to our perceptions by helping us understand things in relation to other ones.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Left Hand of Darkness and Lilith&#039;s Brood, the metaphors are the references to gender that the authors make.  Here&#039;s one to refresh your memory: &quot;Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit&quot;(LeGuin 12)&lt;br /&gt;
While I do not doubt that authors like Butler and LeGuin may be trying to provoke us with these gendered non-gender beings, maybe they&#039;re also just providing supposedly male, or supposedly female attributes, so that WE, as readers, can engage in and better understand (and maybe even empathize with?) these aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Resistance</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/158</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m about two-thirds of the way through &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; now, and while &quot;Dawn&quot; seemed to focus a bit more on the alien aspect (the Oankali) this second part seems to shift towards the humans, both resister and &quot;trader&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, a majority of the humans of Lilith&#039;s Brood are really not that unusual...they like to build and create, they like their individuality and freedom, and they have their squabbles and disagreements.  The little town of Phoenix is a prime example of this, and it is quite easy to draw parallels to our own societies and history from the descriptions given of this town (Butler 345).  And it is hardly surprising, considering that these people are attempting to restore the old world that they had lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is both surprising and absurd how these people can still refuse to give up their &quot;humanity&quot; as they call it.  Alright, so maybe it seems like the people would be giving up their humanity by going to the Oankali...what with bearing offspring that possess traits of both....and anyone with a bit of sense would be hesitant to trust such a situation.  Really....who would want to completely change the way humanity lives and reproduces at the drop of a hat...no questions asked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it would seem that in &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot;, choosing humanity over the alien has even worse consequences.  The people of Phoenix are no longer able to reproduce and force themselves to steal or buy stolen children in order to avoid &quot;going with them&quot;.  In such a society, the people are prone to hurting one another...a prime example being when Tino&#039;s parents tear apart Tate&#039;s home to kill the raiders (355).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the people of resister towns such as Phoenix are either slowly dying without hope of offspring or killing each other off over various grievances.  Oddly enough, this draws parallels to the war that started it all....with humans of all sorts killing each other.  In a way, this is the Oankali versus the humans in another war that could tear the world apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder really....wouldn&#039;t these people have learned their lesson already?  I mean, they nearly killed everyone once as it is....why continue on a path that could repeat this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe the answer, while not entirely clear, is something not unfamiliar.  That concept of humanity...the xenophobia that inhabits nearly all human beings to some degree (though we may not express it).....  That fear of the different that causes Lilith so much trouble getting used to Jdahya in the beginning of the trilogy...  Simply because we use appearance as an indication of allegiance, these humans fail to see some of the reason the Oankali put forth (though I will say that I&#039;m still not 100% sure about them).  This same feeling which causes racism and stereotyping....which causes humans of all kinds to make decisions without knowledge or reason.  A terrible thing, but one that we cannot be totally rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have not finished the trilogy, I do not know what this feeling will cause....will all humans eventually accept the Oankali or not?  Guess I&#039;ll find out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>saving humans</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/155</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were discussing in class whether or not humans deserved what the Oankali were doing to/for? them, there was something floating in the back of my mind: early on, I think it is Jdayah that tells Lilith about saving her and the others. He says that they rarely interfere with a species&#039; self-destruction because the species usually wants it--but they interefered with the humans because they knew not all of humanity was ready to die. Obviously the first question is how did they know this since they obviously have difficulty understanding people. Second, if humanity actually did want to continue, then what the Oankali are doing is not helpful. They are changing humanity. By creating hybrid children of both the humans and the Oankali, humanity is still being destroyed, in a way. Whether this is better or worse is obviously arguable, but certainly Lilith&#039;s child will not be purely human. So my question is, how can the Oankali say what they&#039;re doing is saving humanity?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Cohesison in Lilith&#039;s Brood: Dawn</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/154</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really a criticism of Butler&#039;s work, but an observation I&#039;ve been mulling over for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I&#039;ve finished Dawn and am working through Adulthood Rites. Like most of you, I&#039;m doing so through the format of the Lilith&#039;s Brood omnibus edition that collects all three novels. But reading this all consecutively offers a different experience than what one would get by reading the novels individually; for instance, reading Dawn on its own and getting to Adulthood Rites later. And I&#039;m very curious what impression one would get from reading the three novels as individual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audience raised on pop culture and genre fiction generally expects narrative cohesion; that everything get resolved, or at least have a clean break from one unit in the series to the next. Though the universe&#039;s story is not completely settled, the individual plot threads of the novel are usually tied up to the point where the conclusion at least feels satisfying. Consider recent examples like the TV show House ( though House is still messed up, the medical mystery of the episode is solved, and the patient in question goes off into the sunset ), the Harry Potter novels ( each book chronicles one school year, a clear start and end to that book&#039;s adventure ), and distinct story arcs in comic books that are later collected in complete trade paperbacks ( though the overarching story of a series like Preacher or Y the Last Man continues, each collection offers a complete narrative ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn, however, followed an opposite trend. The ending of Dawn does offer a significant change-- Nikanji impregnating Lilith with the dead Joseph&#039;s DNA-- but it&#039;s really just a continuation of the larger problem that Lilith faces. Since her awakening, the Oankali have been meddling in her affairs to a ridiculous extent, using their seeming omniscence to determine what&#039;s best for her, only answering her questions when they want to, and altogether robbing her of the ability to choose her own fate. Lilith is obviously ambivalent to this, as any sane person would be, but the aliens don&#039;t relent-- they modify her gene structure, they determine what time and place she&#039;ll be,  they throw upon her the responsibility of being the leader to the Awakened humans, etc. And the final scene doesn&#039;t resolve anything, it just confirms the fact that Lilith is the prisoner of these benevolently tyrannical aliens. Just because they sensed that she was alone and wanted a child doesn&#039;t give them the right to put one inside her without asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t a problem when the work is read in one seamless volume, but if I were to read Dawn independently, I&#039;d probably be frustrated; not so much by the cliffhanger ending, but the fact that Lilith has made no progress whatsoever, and is still the Oankali&#039;s puppet. Given what they&#039;ve done to her, almost any good will she may have towards the aliens strikes me as the onset of Stockholm&#039;s Syndrome...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as power for the ooloi</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(This started out as a reply to two separate posts, but got rather long and wandered off a bit on its own argument, so I&#039;m posting it independently, but referencing the posts that inspired parts of it where applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to CZ and his assertion that the Oankali are definitely alien in &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/152&quot;&gt;his comment to roseblack&#039;s post&lt;/a&gt; --I&#039;m not going to argue that there is a direct correlation between every aspect of the Oankali and humans.  Lacking my own tentacled ooloi, I&#039;d be a bit hard pressed.  I will, however, argue that there are many parallels to be drawn between them and us, particularly pertaining to gender.  That is, if I can be trusted to not be apparently inherently manipulative self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151&quot;&gt;As CZ stated in own blog&lt;/A&gt;, the Oankali are not in the moral right they wish to see themselves inhabiting (a self-delusion to which humans themselves are prone).  Taking the argument one step further, they themselves are a hierarchical society, both internally with the submission of the males and females to the ooloi, and in the way they treat humans, who they claim they want as partners in an *equal* trade, instead treating the humans as pets, as Lilith herself explicitly notes when Nikanj first shows her off to the other Oankali its age (54).  One would be hard pressed to argue that the Oankali do not treat the humans as lesser beings than themselves.  There&#039;s a clear power dynamic present, in favor of the Oankali.  Power dynamic implies hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this seemingly inter-species conflict translate to gender?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, it doesn&#039;t.  There is a whole lot being said about race here.  The different races of the humans are mentioned, but not dwelt on because there is such a huge gap between human and oankali.  But there are clear parallels to gender within the power dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, though, I would like to point out that Butler was born in America (right here in LA, actually), and lived here during her life, and she specifically sees her work as commenting on the Western construct of race, and implied, greater Western societal situation.  I will point you in &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.sfwa.org/members/butler/&quot;&gt;this direction&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point into her biography and what she has to say about her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roseblack brought up the idea that, while less graphic and traditionally violent than our society&#039;s concept of rape, or the flat-out rape attempts portrayed in the book, Nikanj rapes Lilith when it impregnates her in a comment replying to Count Zero&#039;s comment to the original roseblack post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some etymology.  In Middle English, rape meant to do something hurriedly.  By the fifteenth century, though, the word took on the meaning &quot;The act of taking anything by force; violent seizure (of goods), robbery&quot; (noun) and &quot;To rob, strip, plunder (a place). Also used with a group of people as object&quot; (verb) (OED online).   Fundamentally, rape isn&#039;t about sex.  It&#039;s about exerting power over another individual against the other person&#039;s will, power over that person&#039;s body, somehow objectifying that person, and doing this through a means that, nowadays, involves sexual organs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the book.  Regardless of how many different individuals&#039; genetic material Nikanj manipulated and melded and modified to impregnate Lilith with some &quot;perfect&quot; embryo, it is Nikanj who decides that Lilith should be impregnated, without her knowledge or consent, taking control of her own body away from her for its own purposes.  Additionally, this happens just after the humans have realized that, without their knowledge or informed consent, the ooloi have taken away the humans&#039; ability to have any physical contact with one another without extreme discomfort and revulsion.  Additionally, they have rendered the humans sterile without their consent.  The ooloi have manipulated the humans so that the ooloi have complete and utter control over the bodies of the human, control over the humans as objects, and they manipulate the objects sexually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lilith fends off the attempted rape of Allison, she says &quot;There&#039;ll be no rape here...Nobody here is property.  Nobody has the right to the use of anybody else&#039;s body...We stay human.  We treat each other like people, and we get through this like people&quot; (178).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oankali, especially the ooloi, do not abide by this.  The rhetoric of Nikanj made my skin crawl.  It says to Lilith, when discussing the problems that occurred by bonding with the humans before they were sent to the proto-forest, &quot;&#039;But most of us couldn&#039;t wait&#039;...It wrapped a sensory arm around her neck loosely.  &#039;It might have been better for both our peoples if we were not so strongly drawn to you&#039;&quot; (202).  Nikanj is placing the blame for fucking up the humans ON the humans because the humans were just too damned attractive to the Oankali for their own good.  Were the humans all running around in short skirts, asking for it, too?  The Oankali see themselves as indisputable superior to the humans (again, in creeps hierarchy), and thus somehow, the failings of the Oankali are not entirely their own fault.  Later, when Joseph is killed, it&#039;s because the oankali underestimated humans.  There&#039;s an implication that humans, without anyone to moderate them, and too impulsive, violent, and weak-willed for their own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the second time Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj have sex, Joseph says &quot;No!...You said I could choose.  I&#039;ve made my choice!&quot; to which Nikanj replies &quot;&#039;You have, yes.&#039;  It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment from him.  When he would have backed away, it held him.  It managed to lie down on the bed with him without seeming to force him down.  &#039;You see.  Your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (189).  Um, rape much?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#039;s not something inherently male or female, either on the victim or victimizer&#039;s side of the equation.  In our own society, yes, there&#039;s a tendency for certain genders to act against others, but it&#039;s not a rule, and there are certainly cases of women raping men, men raping men, women raping women, transgendered people raping and being raped by other transgenders, men, and women.  It&#039;s not something inherent to any specific gender.  Certain types/pairings get more coverage and/or happen with more frequency, based on population size, societal expectations that people live down to, the comfort in acknowledging what happened as rape.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the ooloi male in this instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When push comes to shove, however much we want to skirt around it, when it comes to humans, you&#039;re sterile, you have functional sperm, or you have functional eggs and a functional womb.  As far as the propagation of the species goes, this is it.  While the oankali have their own system of procreation, when they interbreed with the humans, they adopt and must work with certain aspects of human procreative anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the ooloi be seen as a neutered medical professional?  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of a movement to brand fertility specialists as rapists, or inherently male.  The oankali assert throughout the text that they use organic matter the way we use machines.  So why aren&#039;t the ooloi just cold, clinical medical professionals, using internal labs, probes, and turkey basters instead of synthetic ones?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s because they do not give their patients/hosts/victims a choice in the matter.  And, ultimately, in taking the genetic material, blending it, and then placing it in the womb, the ooloi are serving a function that, while more complex than traditional male fertilization in humans, achieves the same end.  Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child.  Without the presence of sperm, the gumball&#039;s just going to roll right out the machine at the end of a woman&#039;s menstrual cycle.  Is the maleness of the ooloi increased by the sensory arms?  Yes.  The imagery is certainly there to be interpreted as phallic at will.  But we don&#039;t know exactly *how* the embryo is inserted.  It&#039;s after Joseph&#039;s death, so not during sex.  The implication is that Nikanj implanted it sometime after Lilith had healed it and was herself recovering.  Again, kinda sketchy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that, because it creates the embryo, the ooloi is actually functioning more as a female.  Really long fallopian tubes, maybe.  It just doesn&#039;t ring true for me.  I think what really drove the masculinity of the ooloi in procreation home for me was, on page 246, when Nikanj tells Lilith she&#039;s pregnant--&quot;I have made you pregnant with Joseph&#039;s child.  I wouldn&#039;t have done it so soon, but I wanted to use his seed, not a printâ€¦And there&#039;s a limit to how long I can keep sperm alive.&quot;  This passage struck me far more as Nikanj being a conduit for the passage of sperm, taking the place of Joseph (male) because Joseph and Lilith were no longer able to touch one another.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, CZ said, in response to roseblack, &quot;It actually designs the genetic code for its offspring, and as an afterthought returns that design to the female&#039;s body.&quot;  The fact that, even though it has the genetic code, it CANNOT go through gestation, sets it up as male, compared to our base of knowledge and underlying biases going into the book.  It&#039;s not so much an afterthought as an apparent inability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&quot;You&#039;re going to have a baby and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; (roseblack)&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Now that is a far better point, but less directly male. The Ooloi do serve the role of determining birth time (as men did before the advent of birth control in more developed countries, and still do in less developed ones) but it is a subtle, finely tuned, and ultimately stronger dominance than simple penetration.&#039;(CZ)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#039;re arguing that the ooloi are hyper-male, super-male?  Unless there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing.  And while, yes, birth control can prevent birth, on the flip side, some aspect of a man is still necessary to *create* a baby if a woman so desires, so it really is rather impossible to completely remove one gender or the other from procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, not to be discounted, there IS a history of patriarchy in our society, like it or not.  On some respects, the ooloi are neutering the men and turning themselves into hyper-men when it comes to the process of procreation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the second book, it becomes explicitly clear that the ooloi have rendered the &quot;pure&quot; humans sterile to force assimilation with the oankali, or die out as a race.  They say, though, that they have given humans a choice.  It&#039;s not much of a choice, though.  And it completely disempowers humans as individuals, taking away their ability to create their own future.  This has both racial and gendered overtones to it, but seemed worth bringing up at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the ooloi always male?  No.  Compared to how humans are portrayed in the book, all of the oankali have impressively fluid personalities, independent of gender.  I was actually rather struck by how abnormally black and white the treatment human gender was, comparatively.  Perhaps it&#039;s more that there ARE gender distinctions among the humans, whereas they oankali are portrayed as more of an overall group, perhaps because they are the Other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, in the particular instance that roseblack initially spoke of, directly regarding the ooloi&#039;s role in reproduction, the ooloi is given a role of dominance over every other type of creature in its society and human society.  In this specific act, the ooloi is treated as male, when seen through the filter of our own society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hierarchy and the Oankali Contradiction.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My first reactions to Lilith&#039;s Brood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Heriarchy is not a genetic trait.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The Oankali (especially Ooloi) manipulation of humans is immoral.&lt;br /&gt;
3) The Oankali are no more moral than humanity, since both are driven by supposedly inescapable genetic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Hierarchical behavior is too complex to be purely genetic. Unless Butler can point to specific evolutionary pressures that would cause such a trait to occur, I&#039;m going to have to call bullshit on that whole idea. Without that specifically ingrained trait, there is no reason for the Oankali to render all humans sterile (until Jodahs) without an Ooloi. Without that trait human behavior could simply be re-trained. The Ooloi are spectacularly effective manipulators, after all. (I&#039;ll ignore the biological impossibility of heirarchical behavior being genetically inherited in my subsequent points, and instead examine morality in Butler&#039;s universe, where this is true) And that brings me to my second point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Despite the supposed genetic predisposition of the Ooloi to find new things, to heal them, and to bring them in line with their own idea of morality, I think that their extended manipulation of humans is morally suspect. The Oankali as a race, and the Ooloi in general, do not treat humans as if they have any level of choice, and simply manipulate them. They assume that the humans do not have choice because of their biological contradiction, and the Oankali assume they must choose for Humanity. The way that Nikanj uses Lilith, using it&#039;s own pheromones to bind her tightly to it, without telling her about the side effects (She can&#039;t touch Joseph), is presumptuous to the extreme and, I believe, morally wrong. Even worse is Jodahs&#039; unwillingness to tell his soon-to-be mates the same facts, despite seeing how hard it is for his human mother, Lilith, to deal with what Nikanj did to her. He assumes he knows what&#039;s best, he assumes it will be OK, but really all it is is biological greed driving him. Which brings me to my third point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Here&#039;s the Oankali Contradiction: They believe they have the right and the ability to choose for humanity, because humanity is biologically flawed, and the Oankali can &quot;correct&quot; that. But the Oankali themselves are driven by an immensely powerful biological need, that manifests itself in a particular set of morals. These morals are thus no more pressing, no more valid than the supposed lack of morals that the humans exhibit. Both are driven by biology, in this world, and so what we see in the end is a triumph of Oankali biology over human biology, instead of the morally righteous triumph of an angelic race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-CZ&lt;/p&gt;
