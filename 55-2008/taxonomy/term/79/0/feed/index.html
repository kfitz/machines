 <title>The World According to Asperger&#039;s</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/348</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crake&#039;s placement at &quot;Asperger&#039;s U&quot; naturally begs the question of whether or not Atwood was implying that Crake had Asperger&#039;s Syndrome.  Looking at Crake&#039;s mental offspring, I believe the answer to be &quot;yes.&quot;  While Crake&#039;s genetic modifications of humans into Crakers was ostensibly aimed at eliminating traits that would lead to long-term self-destruction or adding traits that increased survivability against wolvogs and the like, there seems to be another element.  Crake appears to have created a society in which the more subtle nuances of human communication are no longer used.&lt;br /&gt;
	When Snowman first speaks to the Crakers, we find that they are completely blunt.  &quot;From an ordinary man Jimmy would have found it brusque, even aggressive, but these people didn&#039;t go in for fancy language: they hadn&#039;t been taught evasion, euphemist, lily-gilding.  Their interactions are similarly simplified whenever we encounter them.  Their mating ritual is structured such that its rules are completely clear, and can be described with perfect accuracy.  The structure eliminates jealousy, but if Crake and his team could ensure that no jealousy existed after the ritual, they could also have ensured a lack of jealousy within various monogamy or polyamory based structures.  What he&#039;s done is to create a society with as few individualized relationship, and thus as little need to build them through interaction, as possible.  On one level, it&#039;s like Aperger&#039;s paradise.&lt;br /&gt;
	On the other hand, the trade-off of Asperger&#039;s as presented by Atwood is the focus available for continued intellectual pursuits.  In this new world, where a life&#039;s academic exploration is necessarily short, and most of the modes in which it could be pursued have been destroyed, walking this far down the Asperger&#039;s path seems rather unnecessary.  Perhaps Crake created his children in his image for the same reasons that anyone reproduces biologically, and this part of his plan had less to do with utility (for he seemed to know that he wouldn&#039;t see this bright new world of his), and more to do with a fundamental need to see one&#039;s self placed within the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Last Man Standing</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/342</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What I found most captivating about Oryx and Crake was the total sense of isolation that saturates the book.  The narrative helps in creating this sensation of loneliness because the reader is kept ignorant of the most recent events of Snowman&#039;s past up until the very last pages of the book.  As we go along, we have the two separate periods of narration â€“ Jimmy&#039;s childhood and family issues, leading to meeting Crake and school, etc. and then Snowman&#039;s present.  As we get glimpses of Snowman post-apocalypse, we also relive with him his nostalgia and visit to the events of the past with each memory in chronological order.  Until finally, Jimmy becomes Snowman and the two narratives find one another in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire book is narrated by Snowman, and aside from superficial insights into the characters of Oryx and Crake (and perhaps even the parental figures of Jimmy and Crake), his is the only point of view we experience throughout the book.  When we see him react to creations like the ChickieNobs, we understand how to react.  And in his adolescent period when he is playing games with Crake and watching bizarre porn and executions on the internet, the reader sees that there are distinct differences between our reality and his.  While Snowman is not the most agreeable or inspirational character, the reader identifies with him, partly because we adore flawed heroes, but also because, honestly, he&#039;s our only choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Atwood depicts this type of post-apocalyptic devastation creates a truly haunting vision of the future, that is a little too easy to picture.  The sensations of being abandoned by one&#039;s entire species can really be felt by the reader because the only characters we ever meet are in Jimmy&#039;s head and they are repeatedly made surreal and mirage-like.  The Crakers only help in the most primitive way, appealing to Snowman&#039;s need to be with others, feel human touch, and to speak, to remember the words he used to worship (even though the Crakers have no understanding or context for most of them).  Atwood beautifully conveys the emptiness that Snowman feels, realistically simulating the waves of semi-contentment and total despair at the reality of his situation.  It seems to be a common trope of science fiction, but also the genre of zombie movies, to create a fiction in which the hero is alone, isolated, and facing the extinction of all human beings should he/she fail.  In the film Resident Evil: Extinction, there is a similar landscape, dry and exceedingly hot, with supplies, food, and weapons rapidly diminishing while the enemy grows.  Snowman&#039;s only enemies were hunger, madness, and the wildlife (including the marauding bands of pigs with people parts).  Obviously, within the context of action films the main character, Alice, has superhuman characteristics and the audience knows from the start that she will triumph over her obstacles.  Part of the appeal of Snowman is that he is Everyman, John Smith, a neurotypical, with absolutely no exceptional skills, no super-attuned senses of physical abilities and there is no certain prediction for his future within this miserable shell of the former world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems particularly upsetting that there is no Hollywood resolution to this book, although it would be difficult to imagine how such a fictional space could have a happy ending.  Even though the book ends incredibly abruptly, with many possibilities and questions for the immediate future, the resolution of the two stories into one at least provides a narrative closure and a degree of satisfaction with how the story concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hubertus and Cayce.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/330</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the analysis that I performed on Pattern Recognition in my final essay, I concluded that Cayce was almost asexual in the novel, and that any graphic or direct depictions of sex had an adverse effect on the commitments that Cayce had made or wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over the novel, in revising my paper, I&#039;ve realized that Cayce is far from asexual. In fact, I feel like her sexuality is a really fundamental piece of her personality, but, like everything about her and the novel, it is understated to the point that it is difficult to notice. One of the major interactions that I failed to consider in my first analysis was the interaction between Cayce and Hubertus, when they go out to the bar and Hubertus proposes the Footage project (61-73). Throughout the interaction, Cayce feels Hubertus&#039; presence: his voice is &quot;strangely compelling&quot; (62), he is &quot;undeniably good-looking&quot; (67), she feels herself &quot;held by those eyes, against all conscious will&quot; (64), she even flirts a little bit at the end of the night, showing Hubertus how to put on his cowboy hat properly (73). Cayce is clearly attracted to Hubertus, somehow, but it is a definitely physical attraction. Though it may not be directly sexual, it is definitely not intellectual, and in fact goes counter to Cayce&#039;s natural impulses. Sex is one of the first things on her mind when she interacts with Bigend (she&#039;s suddenly on &quot;full sexual alert&quot; (63)), so she is clearly not asexual. She understands and realizes her own reactions to Bigend, but she keeps them hidden and does not outwardly react to them. But nevertheless, this desire, this outward sexuality is associated with Bigend, who Cayce never completely trusts (also partly because of the sexual betrayal that he has inflicted on her friend from New York). Throughout the novel, it is the handsome men, the ones that she feels some sort of desire for, that Cayce distrusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my reconsideration of the overall tone of the novel, and of Cayce&#039;s attitude towards sex, I still think that the direct appearance of sex is closely associated with the breaking of commitments and a lack of trust. There is one major counter-example to this argument, that was pointed out by both professor Fitzpatrick and my peer reviewer. In my rough draft, I mentioned the example of Donny, who is mentioned at length only twice in the novel, both times regarding sexual experiences that Cayce had with him. I regarded both of these experiences as essentially the same: direct portrayals of sex, and a direct associations between sex and Donny, who Cayce rightly broke up with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reviewers pointed out that the real reason that Cayce broke up with Donny was not because of the overt association between him and sex (Cayce is &quot;more or less happy&quot; lying underneath him, after all), but instead because of the association of Donny with extremely violent behavior (finding the gun taped conveniently behind his headboard) (41). I agree with this argument, to some extent. However, I think that the association between this breakup and sex is inescapable. It could have been any other time that Cayce could have realized that Donny was a violent person. He could have hit her, he could have gotten unreasonably angry, she could even have found the gun while she was stretching to wake up in the morning next to him. But she found it during sex. Her breakup with this person, no matter the actual reason, occurred during the one and only semi-graphic portrayal of sex in the entire novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m sure that there were good moments with Donny, just as there are redeeming factors to Boone Chu and Hubertus, but in the way that Cayce&#039;s attraction to all these men is associated with lack of trust and the breaking of commitments, the novel discounts these good qualities and returns to my main point: sex must be secondary in Cayce&#039;s interactions with others, or there can be no trust between them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gender role confusion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/310</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s an interesting construction of gender roles in Midnight Robber.  Nalo Hopkinson seems to be paying a certain amount of lip service to the idea that in the future envisioned, people will be able to choose their roles and occupations regardless of gender.  She accomplishes this sometimes by reference to olden times in which roles were more stratified, as when the eshu tries to explain to a confused Tan-Tan how once, women weren&#039;t allowed to play the Midnight Robber.  Tan-Tan&#039;s confusion reflects her complete expectation that what she will be able to do will be unrelated to her gender.  Similarly, Hopkinson breaks stereotypes about women&#039;s ability to do hard manual labor with frequent reference to the physical strength of her female characters.  Even Ione is described at least once in terms of her musculature, and the original runner is female.&lt;br /&gt;
	At the same time, Antonio at least has very strong expectations of the roles that will be taken by the women around him.  In Toussaint, he expects his affairs to go unremarked, but explodes over Ione&#039;s.  In New Half-Way Tree, he retires from the fields, but cannot believe that Janisette would want him to take care of chickens, or  a garden.  Originally, it seemed possible that this stratification was limited to him, but the staff of the house in Toussaint, the cultured, and thus presumably more progressive, world, take for granted his dual-standard of sexual behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
	An interesting thing about the move to New Half-Way Tree is that the rougher lifestyle and the need to physically work there seems to bring out the disparities in expectations for men and women.  Men consistently seem to enforce law, instead of the feminized figure of Granny Nanny, and the word slut is used openly.&lt;br /&gt;
	On that level, the douen and the hinte, who have openly, directly separated tasks for men and women based on their physical competencies, seem much more sophisticated.  This is particularly true because they seem to have found a balance of power within their roles, rather than the humans, who live in a much more clearly male-dominated society.  What male domination we see among the douen appears to be an artifact of Tan-Tan&#039;s perspective, having seen the packbirds so long as non-sentient.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Time Travel in Midnight Robber?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/305</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing Midnight Robber, I got to thinking.  There is a lot of talk about how New Half-Way Tree is in a different dimension.  What if instead it was in a different time?  I don&#039;t know exactly what that adds to the work, but it seems to fit better, and explain current Touissant more fully.&lt;br /&gt;
I started thinking about time travel instead of dimensional travel when I first read about the shift pods.  While fairly stock, they made it clear that they were not really moving through space.  The explanation was that they moved through dimensions, but it seemed far easier to explain that they were moving back in time.  I think that New Half-Way Tree is Touissant, but back in time a few hundred years.  This makes it more obvious why the myths of the Midnight Robber and Robber Queen spread so easily.  They could easily have been already passed on to the people of Touissant when they arrived, and found there way into myth enough that eventually Tan-Tan had the motivation to perform acts of legend.  This theory also explains why many of the larger animals are extinct on Touissant, and the Mako Jumbie bird had been domesticated.  There is plenty of time to domesticate the bird if New Half-Way Tree is set a few hundred years back.  It also explains the absence of the Douen, because they could have been eradicated by the humans of New Half-Way Tree before the colony ships ever arrived, relegating them to myths before the culture of Touissant could exert itself.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, this explanation is slightly debunked by Hopkinson&#039;s own narrative.  She does talk about the other dimension a lot throughout the work.  Since this is mostly humans talking, there is no problem with just explaining it as human ignorance.  However, Hopkinson also talks about Grammy Nanny searching through the dimensions to find Tan-Tan, a description that wouldn&#039;t make as much sense if New Half-Way Tree was just back in time.  The time difference though does explain why Grammy Nanny cannot affect anything that happens on New Half-Way tree.  Grammy Nanny would not be able to affect anything before she was created.  This would make the scene with the shift pods more believable too, because the eshu kept talking to Tan-Tan for a reasonable length of time while in the shift pod.  If the shift pod was traveling back in time, then the eshu would have a reasonable amount of time before the pod went to a time before it was created.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, in the end, time travel doesn&#039;t seem all that likely.  There is only one reason why Hopkinson would state that it was dimensional travel instead of time travel; to show an interesting recursive myth creation that would not add all that much to the story, and create weird paradoxes.  If the myths that Tan-Tan was told were about her it would create a lot of pre-determinism that doesn&#039;t really fit into the story. I like to think that the time travel works, but it doesn&#039;t add enough to the story to justify me shoehorning it into Hopkinson&#039;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>deities in &quot;midnight robber&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/303</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting, yet very briefly discussed, differences between the inhabitants born on Toussaint and those whose ancestry traces far back on New Half-Way Tree is the concept of a higher power, the god-figure.  The humans have Granny-Nanny while the douens have Father Bois.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, this difference can be attributed to the realities from which each species originates.  The douen live in a massive tree that provides them with food, shelter, and water.  If the tree did not take on some level of godhood, it would be confusing.  The humans, contrastingly, are in a technological world, where Granny Nanny is literally inside your head, inescapably from birth.  The Eshu in some respects reminded me of angels.  They are the mouth pieces for Granny-Nanny, who is somewhat incapable of directly speaking to the humans (i.e. the eshu are Alan Rickman in Dogma).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something deeper than this, though.  When the humans are sent to New Half-Way Tree, they are very clearly severed from the Granny-Nanny network, yet they still invoke Granny Nanny much the same people in our world today invoke God in times of mild frustration, taking the name as an oath.  Granny does, however, manage to break through the dimensional barrier (again, godlike omnipresence) and implant herself in Tubman, sowing the seeds for a somewhat perverted messianic story.  The fact that Tubman is a child of incest, and thus of only one parental bloodline, also feeds into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The douens, on the other hand, see Father Bois as a benevolent figure who simply nurtures and loves.  Chichibud says to Tan-Tan when he finds her under her dead father, &quot;Papa Bois see what really happen in that room, Tan-Tan.  He ain&#039;t judging you&quot; (172).  When he takes her to the home tree, the incarnation of Papa Bois, Chichibud tells Tan-Tan to come in peace and go in friendship (179).  When the douen feel forced to cut down Father Bois, the tree reincarnates with unbelievable speed, creating a strong sense of the a messianic creature, but different from Tubman.  Where Tubman is a bridge, the tree seems to be what is waiting on the other side of the bridge, the incarnation of the return to paradise when creatures are redeemed from The Fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when Father Bois interacts with the mythic Tan-Tan and Antonio and creates the original Half-Way Tree, there is something vengeful in him at that moment as well.  It seems that there is something inherent to the humans that prevents them from experiencing unconditional benevolence and love from any deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this dichotomy parallels the versions of God in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  The humans are associated with the vengeful, powerful God of the Old Testament, whereas the douen are a far more peaceful people in and of themselves, and thus can better accept and comprehend the loving, forgiving God of the New Testament.  Taking things away from the Christian Bible, the douen also seem to have developed more f a oneness with nature, whereas the humans fight it, and thus incite conflict from the forces that surround and govern them.  It seems that once again man&#039;s inherent hierarchical tendencies and the violence that springs from these tendencies will be his downfall and stumbling block, no matter where he goes or how low he is dragged down.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tank Girl was a trip, but this is my response to Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/231</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In Slow River, we are presented with a protagonist who is rarely who she says she is, yet always remains herself.  Frances Lorien van de Oest is the kidnapped heir to a multi-billion dollar company working as a grunt in a sanitation plant for little pay.  Nicola Griffith uses Slow River to present Identity as a two-fold concept, where one is defined by a legal classification, yet also by the set of morals and experiences they carry with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most pressing and recognized identity is of course the legal identity.  Present in the form of PIDAs, they are microcapsules implanted into the crook of the thumb and forefinger that are scanned for economic transactions, and detail the owner much in the same way as a license.  When Lore gains her new identity, she is given all the details with the PIDA: &quot;Bird, Sal.  Female.  Caucasian.  Blood type A positive.  DOBâ€¦ Twenty-fiveâ€¦The tiny black PIDA was in a sealed bag withâ€¦ a plaskin pouch the size of a pink cockroach.  Frozen blood for DNA tests,&quot; (21).  When Lore was still part of the van de Oest family, she had her own PIDA rather than that of a dead woman, and when kidnapped, the first thing to go was this legal identity.    By removing her PIDA, her kidnappers create a legal nobody, making it impossible for her to prove her identity on her own or access her family&#039;s resources.  Lore becomes a nobody, but at the same time can now be anybody simply by obtaining false temporary PIDAS, giving her a new sense for the world and for what an identity is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her reactions to experiences with Spanner of switching identities through various PIDAs, Lore shows her true inner identity, and comes to realize it is an inescapable, defining part of her.  While working as Sal Bird at the Hedon Road Plant, Lore is supposed to know little more than the most basic of procedures and functionings of the facility.  Yet when she recognizes issues with the operation, she can&#039;t help but remember things from her van de Oest past.  Magyar, her supervisor, tells her that the bacteria in the plant need to always be at 27.3oC, never anywhere else, yet Lore recognizes and almost speaks out to tell her, &quot;For a denitrification-nitrification process, heterotrophic facultative bacteria were usually comfortable anywhere between twenty-five and thirty degrees,&quot; but realizes in time that this is something Sal Bird would have no conception of (47).  In addition to the knowledge, though, Lore also retains some of her superiority complexes, as shown when she discovers that her family&#039;s nutrient products have been substituted with generics.   While the bacteria are most likely completely capable of surviving and functioning with the nutrients provided by the generic brand, Lore feels that the lives of millions of people are being put at grievous, unnecessary risk.  Yet the plant functions fine until an occurrence of deliberate sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lore&#039;s experiences through the novel help her to realize that there are two levels to identity.  The surface level that most people see is the legal and falsifiable persona, but the deeper, moral identity is something that cannot be recreated and invented so easily, as it is an accumulation of knowledge and experiences.  The two together serve to act as the real, present self, and at the end of the novel, Lore recognizes that finally she &quot;would be nobody but the Lore [she] had made,&quot; (343).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/59</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During class this week, there was a lot of discussion about Case, with his &quot;Cowboy&quot; job description and lack of personal choice, and about Molly and her street-samurai status and prostitute beginnings.  After finishing Neuromancer, I find one of the most interesting characters to be Armitage, or Col. Corto, especially so soon after reading Starship Troopers.  In a way, this man&#039;s military background combined with his uncontrolled &quot;life&quot; and death creates an inverse perspective, perhaps even an ironic parody, of the military lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
	When the reader first meets Armitage in the novel, the first detail is of a &quot;broad chest, hairless and muscular&quot;, &quot;blue eyes so pale they made Case think of bleach&quot;, and &quot;an angular gold ring through the [ear] lobe.&quot;(Gibson 27-28)  Immediately, it is made clear that Armitage is a powerful man, equally capable of taking care of himself in a fight as in a business transaction.  The earring is immediately made clear as representation of military Special Forces, which in Case&#039;s world also means the most advanced technology.  This man has countless resources at his disposal, and seems to have more control over his life than any character in the plot so far.  This is not a man who is paid and led along a path; this man is the one who commands, who controls and manipulates those around him into doing his will.  This is only reinforced by the miracle deal he offers Case, and the subsequent revelation of the previously undeclared catch that binds Case to him.   Armitage seems to hold all of the cards, all of the time.	However, later it is revealed that the entire Screaming Fist operation that Armitage participated (and extraordinarily survived) was not to test the effectiveness of the new hacking technology, but to test the effectiveness of the enemy&#039;s EMP weapons on unprepared troops.   They had been expected to die.  While the character Johnny from Starship Troopers might say it was a sacrifice for the nation, here in the much more individualized, discriminatory world of Case&#039;s and Armitage&#039;s, it emerges as a largely arbitrary act commanded by higher level officers and carried out by the unknowing foot soldiers. The only reason Col. Corto (a.k.a. Armitage) survived the slaughter of the Screaming Fist operation and his ensuing coma was through the will of a powerful A.I. by the name of Wintermute.  The Armitage that Case and Molly have known to this point is only an engineered construct from the remnants of Cortos consciousness.  Clearly, Corto has actually had no control over his life from this time onward.  Corto later relives this operation after his constructed consciousness breaks down, reveals that he knows he was betrayed by his Commanders, and is consequently betrayed and destroyed by his engineer Wintermute.&lt;br /&gt;
	From the point Corto is assigned to this mission, he has no further discretion in his own life.   Even Case, who is under the control of his addictions, contractors, and habits, is able to decide where he wants to be or what he wants to do.  Armitage does what he is programmed to do, period, and has even been conditioned to think that these are his own decisions.  He is the ultimate epitome of the cyberpunk culture; while Case and Molly seem to drift numbly through their lives from job too job in a meaningless landscape, Armitage Is actually incapable of feeling any real emotion, and has lost any recognition of the land around him past what Wintermute has programmed him to know.&lt;/p&gt;
