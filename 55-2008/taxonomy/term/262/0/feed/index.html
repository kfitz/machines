 <title>Could talk some more about race, but...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is defined from the second page as someone who kicks ass: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment of his and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren&#039;t afraid of the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords require no demonstrations&quot; (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some satiric bite to Stephenson&#039;s picture of America as a cross between a streetfight and an NRA convention, but there is rather more to the violence than necessary that particular aim. Which is not to say that Stephenson worries to much about wearing his jokes out, or even advancing the plot smoothly. But there is another motive behind all this--it&#039;s central to Hiro&#039;s development as a character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street cimre. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.  Hiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken&quot; (271)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not plot that drives the violence of the book. It is not satire, either. It isn&#039;t even the congenital obsession of science fiction--the invention of new and amusing ways for characters to fold, spindle and mutilate each other. It is the way Hiro grows. We know he likes swords, we know that he no longer wants to be the world&#039;s baddest motherfucker, and we know that he can administer the coup de grace when he must.  Big parts of Hiro&#039;s personality, as Stephenson presents it, are caught up in the way he fights, and how he feels about that fighting. This seems, somehow, caught up in the way that he constructs gender--when he says all men under twenty-five, he means all men. If it were only Hiro, perhaps this could be overlooked. But it&#039;s not only Hiro, though. All three of the main male characters in SC are killers--Hiro, Raven and Uncle Enzo.  YT, a fifteen-year old girl, also fights when she has to, but it&#039;s non-lethal. She has a sonic skateboard that breaks glass, and pepper spray, and bracelets that give people shocks, but she doesn&#039;t use swords, or guns, or nuclear weapons. But it&#039;s Hiro&#039;s ex-girlfriend, the linguistic hacker Juanita, who shows the difference between men and women in Stephenson most explicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;First things first,&quot; Juanita says. &quot;The control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Okay, you get ready to grab the tablet, and I&#039;ll take out the control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;How are you going to do that? By cutting people up with swords?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yeah. That&#039;s the only thing they&#039;re good for.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Let&#039;s do it the other way around,&quot; Juanita says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence is intended to make the book more entertaining, at least--science fiction readers buy books much more preoccupied with killing than Snow Crash. And it is partly satirical, and Hiro is mocked (gently, compared to the treatment that just about everyone and everything else in the book gets) for it, but there is also a bonding between him and Raven, and Raven and Enzo, over their willingness to fight. A willingness that is needed, to survive in, and save, the America of the future.  For all his parodying, I think that Stephenson, whose vision of America is all the more nightmarish because it is one big free-fire zone, thinks this willingness is worthy of praise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing that concerns me, partly because of the way this novel follows Slow River in our Syllabus: in the not-too-distant future of cyberpunk, Is homosexuality an anachronism? After reading a few cyberpunk novels, I am beginning to wonder about the future of the love that dares not speak its name. Whether due to authorial puritanism or purposeful absence, there is an extreme void in the fiction of Neal Stephenson and William Gibson when it comes to either man-to-man or woman-to-woman love. Gibson skirts around the issue by being farely prudish about sex in general. In Neuromancer, the one encounter between Molly and Case is empty, and lacks any substantial repercussions on either character. Sex is like cyberspace, plug-in and plug-out, only cyberspace is the much more enjoyable of the two activities.  Snow Crash treats sexuality as virtually unchanged from today (with a few technological enhancements, such as the dentata). A natural sexual tension between YT and Hiro builds up through the novel, and much of the plot revolves around Hiro&#039;s desire to reinstate himself with Juanita, and YT&#039;s fling with Raven. Despite the prominence of the sexual side of human interaction, there are few to no references to homosexuality whatsoever in his novel. Where are they? Identity politics definitely exist (look at the apartheid burb-claves), yet no gay identity.  Stephenson&#039;s vision, where commercialized or self-designed avatars act as go-betweens for human interaction on the Street, both point to a redefinition of identity by the sudden lack of physical context to human interaction. In a sympathetic or even passive reading of Gibson or Stephenson, this redefinition implies an abandonment of sexual politics as a viable means of forming community. Considering the embracing of the Internet and WWW by the gay community, the absence of homosexuality in these futurist settings is problematic.  Well, I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>slow river and corporations</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/251</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the &quot;subplots&quot; that make up this novel, I found the Lore/Sal Bird -- Magyar one the most intriguing. In the beginning it definitely inspires a disgust for the corporate machine and how little it seems to care about the consumers of its &quot;product&quot;, which is essential to life: water. All of this seems to suggest that in a technological age, one of humanity&#039;s few remaining weaknesses is its dependence on greedy profit-driven corporations for survival, which is certainly true of our real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was stunned that Magyar ends up falling in love with Lore/Sal Bird; I thought that Magyar would just be the thorn in Lore&#039;s side, the annoying boss who is intimidated by her intelligence and pretends that Lore&#039;s work isn&#039;t good enough to save some face. However, in this section of menial worker ants, Lore is probably the only one who has ever given Magyar a good challenge.  But this ending kind of bothered me because of how &quot;Hollywood&quot; it was...walking away hand in hand &#039;into the sunset&#039; per se. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Magyar in some ways is made to seem more traditionally &quot;feminine&quot; than Spanner (mainly implied by numerous references to her glorious hair swishing behind her), thus suggesting that the best kind of lesbian relationship can only happen between two &quot;feminine&quot; women. I was glad that someone brought this up in class because although it&#039;s clear that Griffith sets out to break a lot of boundaries and go against readers&#039; expectations, she also goes along with some other stereotypes (the porno lesbian being the main one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&#039;s my rant on this novel; not my favorite, but certainly innovative when it comes to sexuality and gender issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Living in a fish-eye lens, caught in the camera eye</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/249</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking elements in Nicola Griffith&#039;s Slow River is the use of cameras.  Throughout the text, the picture seen by the camera somehow shows a raw truth, and is able to catch characters at their most vulnerable moments, and with Lore, somehow seems to draw out her vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the camera is first introduced when Lore is taped begging for ransom.  Her vulnerability at this moment and the total stripping of her defenses by her captors shows an underlying truth of a scared child.  What is more interesting, though, is how knowing others have seen this video creates a level of paranoia in Lore once she escapes.  She has a constant fear (though the intensity of it caries as time passes) that she will be recognized from the video.  She both does not want to go back to her family, and, more importantly, does not want people to associate her with the person who was trapped in the camera&#039;s eye.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore uses the camera against others, specifically Ruth and Ellen, she feels guilt, but she also feels justified in her actions.  Though she cries as she films her friends, she responds to Ruth&#039;s subsequent confrontation by thinking &quot;You&#039;ve seen pictures of me in far more humiliating circumstances; and my abductors did not even have the courtesy to swap my head for another&#039;s&quot; (197).  This point is interesting in several ways.  When Lore is in control, there is a sense that she has earned it, and that being the one wielding the camera is some sort of ultimate control.  There is also the issue of body over face.  Yes, the face is far more recognizable than the body to people.  Yet Ruth implies that, in the situation of sex, especially in porn, it is not the faces that matter, but the body that is being traded and it is the body that becomes identity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore was younger, she made porn films of her parents using stock bodies and grafting her parents&#039; heads on the bodies.  When there s film, it is what is filmed that is directly important--any edits become the work of fantasy.  Lore&#039;s manipulation of her parents&#039; heads and environment on film does not violate them, because she did not actually capture them in a moment of weakness.  It is this capture, this trap that film creates, that is so important n the text, and which justifies Ruth&#039;s anger and sense of betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore manipulates the consensual footage she takes of Tom, he says he does not want to see the final result because he doesn&#039;t want to see himself looking confused and old and pathetic.  There is again the sense that what the camera sees becomes truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final, and perhaps most important use of the camera, comes when Lore tells the story of her life to the camera to be used as a starting point for evidence for the police.  When she sets up the camera, she observes &quot;The camera lens was like a cold fish eye, unblinking.  I stared at it, forgetting what I was supposed to say&quot; (326).  The overwhelmingness of being exposed, laid bare to the camera is shown here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the interesting concept of the fisheye lens.  There is the sense that the camera sees more than a normal eye would see, that there is no escape and there is no ability to hide any part of oneself, really, when presented with the camera.  It speaks to Tom&#039;s fear, that there is a part of himself that really is that confused old man, and Ruth&#039;s anger at her violation by the camera, the capturing of her body against her will, and Lore&#039;s kidnapping being all the more humiliating because her degraded self was shown to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Katerine the Corporate Monster</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/247</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicola Griffith&#039;s &lt;em&gt;Slow River&lt;/em&gt; is an acclaimed piece of science fiction, and insofar as it has realistic portrayals of the interactions between chemistry, biology, corporations, and the environment, it&#039;s a very successful book. But when it comes to the personal and family intrigue, the book has problems. Too many times, the characters&#039; motivations are in question, so the plausibility of the novel suffers. Katerine, especially, is a character whose actions are never fully explicated, who serves as a major antagonist without a cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first encounter Katerine as the one who resisted her husband&#039;s push to have their genes returned to normal. The gray hair is a way of &quot;saying to the world, look, I&#039;m so rich I can afford to have this expensive anticancer treatment&quot; and even though Oster thinks they should turn the gene back on, Katerine &quot;want[s] [Lore] to have all the visible trappings of the rich and powerful&quot; (52). It&#039;s not entirely clear why this is the case. In fact, it seems rather narrow-sighted, or selfish, for Katerine to do this, though plausible that she&#039;s doing it for the sake of her children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the important scene where Lore wakes to &quot;the monster... breathing hot fire on her neck and groaning like a beast&quot; (68). Katerine in this scene makes a small effort at being comforting, but really she just seems to dismiss Lore&#039;s bothers, asking &quot;How could it have got in?&quot; and calling it &quot;Just a dream&quot; (68). We later discover that this is because Katerine herself is the &quot;monster&quot; and she must be trying to hide it. But we never find out why she does this. Presumably Katerine has some sort of perverse sexuality, but there&#039;s never a scene where she explains how she fought against it, or came to accept it, or how she developed it in the first place. Oster, in the same scene, is comforting and helpful. He &quot;takes her hand&quot; and tries to soothe her, offers to &quot;find a lock&quot; for her door immediately, while Katerine is heading off for some &quot;net conference&quot; the next morning (68-69). It is stated that Oster&#039;s actions, throughout the book, are motivated in part by competing with his wife for Lore&#039;s affection, but his behavior (unlike Katerine&#039;s) tends also to be the nurturing love of a parent, whereas Katerine seems caught up in the corporation all the time, and spurns family matters that don&#039;t interact with the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is significant that Oster, not Katerine, is the one who &quot;is fond of saying&quot; that &quot;the company is not the same as the family&quot; (103). This is because, for Katerine, they are the same. When Katerine wants to spend family time with Lore, she &quot;scribbles some catalytic reaction equation on a napkin&quot; and sends &quot;case studies... over the net&quot; while her father &quot;suggests they go look for tree frogs&quot; or &quot;talks... about the new species of carp&quot; (108). Katerine seems focused on training her daughter to be the perfect member of the van der Oest business, not so much on letting her develop as an individual. Katerine&#039;s idea of family fun time is the same as school time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Katerine is totally consumed by her business, and placed in stark contrast with Oster, who barely involves himself in the family business, instead concentrating on whimsical pet projects; but when Lore has a difficult time, Katerine is the one at fault, and Oster is the one who supports her. This speaks to the problems of being so consumed by work that one loses everything else, and that is the only thing approaching an explanation for what makes Katerine a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Some thoughts on Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/246</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am still not sure if Slow River falls into my personal definitions of science fiction.  Obviously, it takes place in the future, and there are extrapolative qualities to the narrative, but it does not seem &quot;sciency&quot; enough to me.  The water parts, although interesting, do not have the same glamorous appeal as interstellar space travel.  One of the most fascinating areas of the novel, to me, was the role of pleasure in manipulating its victims&#039; lives.  Like Molly from Neuromancer, Lore and Spanner utilize a futuristic method to distance themselves from the reality of selling their bodies to men.  However, the implication remains that there is no true escape from prostitution.  Although the drug makes the act itself more pleasurable, eventually one needs to wake up.  Both Molly and Lore have rude awakenings to this fact, and both are forced to continue prostituting themselves once they stop using the drugs.&lt;br /&gt;
	I am interested in the role that prostitution plays in many of the novels that we have read so far.  Obviously, there is the futuristic whorehouse of Neuromancer, and there is the twosome prostitution of Lore and Spanner in Slow River.  However, there is also the necessary prostitution of the humans in Lilith&#039;s Brood.  I am not quite sure if prostitution is the right word, but there is an implied obligation to having sex with the Oankali in order to stay in their good graces.  Again, in Lilith&#039;s Brood, pleasure is used as the seductor for sex, and it proves to be a powerful tool for the Oankali.  Why do all of these novels portray pleasure in such a negative fashion? Or is it simply the manipulation and excess of pleasure that is the real problem?&lt;br /&gt;
	On a somewhat-unrelated note (sorry for the rambling nature of this response paper, but there were so many interesting aspects of Slow River!), I liked her name-choices, although some were a little bit obvious.  The article that we read for today mentioned the hedonistic implications of the plant&#039;s name, but I felt like that was only one of the novel&#039;s many Dickenson-worthy names.  I brought this up in class, but I found it interesting that all of her siblings&#039; names had some sort of fairy-tale connection.  I was trying to remember where I had heard the name Tok from, and I just realized last night that he is a character from The Wizard of Oz collection.  It seemed completely contradictory that Griffith chose to give such a cold family fantasy-related names, but perhaps this irony was what she really wanted for the Van de Oest family.  In addition to the family itself, my presentation group talked a little bit about Spanner and what her name implies.  Although she seems firmly planted in her sector of society (Lore notes the fact that she has found her niche in the underworld), she also seems to have her hand in everything.  There is always the sense that Spanner knows much more than she lets on, although she too is duped by the pleasure-inducing drug.&lt;br /&gt;
	Because there are implications for the other characters&#039; names, I really want to know why Griffith chose to call the manager of the plant Magyar.  It is the Hungarian term for themselves, and I cannot help but wonder why she chose this word.  Maybe it is just the Hungarian blood in me, but I really want to know why!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Identity and Morality</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/245</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of different tenses to describe the different phases of Lore&#039;s life, as intertwined in Slow River, is clearly open to interpretation.  To the degree that the last phase, chronologically, is the one in which first person is used, one might say that Lore simply identifies most with her current incarnation, and that the tale told from ten years further on would invoke the first person only for events later still.  However, it seems possible that the use of third person reflects Lore&#039;s conscious dissociation from herself as she existed before the advent of Sal Bird the second.  One delineated difference between Lore in the different timelines is her relationship with morality.  The Lore of the first sequence (until the kidnapping), seems to have little or no relationship with the construct of morality.  She has occasional snatches of empathy, but her code seems to be loyalty to family, and honor of that which is correct or effective.  Her actions, while not particularly reprehensible, are never placed in a context of morality, despite the fact that, as she later find out, they may be associated with any level of damage to many people.&lt;br /&gt;
By contrast, although her actions with Spanner are harmful on a much smaller scale, Lore seems to feel a constant need to justify herself, or at least a growing concern that she doesn&#039;t feel guilty.  This shift may be a result of greater maturity.  It can also be related to a tension between Lore&#039;s actions, which she sometimes conceptualizes as part of a faÃ§ade, and her attempts to maintain some sort of separate core self.  Her relationship with morality in this phase seems mostly to consist of feeling guilty for not feeling guilty about what she does to the people around her, most notably Ruth and Ellen.  In the first phase, Lore is entrenched in a place where everyone she knows is functionally above any law that happens to exist around them.  By extension, they seem to avoid any association, positive or negative, with ethics.  The lawsuit in Caracas is handled in a manner calculated to discourage further lawsuits, with no consultation with the concept of moral obligation.  She and her family are much like demi-g&#039;ds.  In the second phase, she&#039;s descended to the level of mere mortals, and thus must abide by their laws, constitutional and moral, or risk suffering the consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
In the third phase, Lore&#039;s present, she seems to develop a sense of ethics broader than herself, and rooted on some level a sense of obligation to other people.  She ends up risking exposure or unemployment and a potential return to crime in order to do her job right, and protect the people she works with, as well as the people who drink the water she processes.  She describes her concerns for others as felt, rather than regretted or missed.  From her new perspective, with something of an active moral compass, it makes sense that she would want to dissociate herself from her prior bad acts, and the mindsets that went with them.  She needs to intergrate her experiences in order to process them, and to put herself together, but she&#039;s still trying to escape her past lives, and so she dissociates.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Camera and utilisation in Slow River</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/244</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In any world where identity is important, the camera is going to be a focal point of observation.  In Slow River, in response to Tok&#039;s &quot;Find something,&quot; an admonishment to keep Lore sane with the parents she has, Lore acquires a camera and edit board.  Lore&#039;s filmography becomes a very important part of the book.  It shows not only the fluidity of identity, but shows first how perception of identity can change things.  &quot;Lore&#039;s first projects are wish fulfillment,&quot; and are of her parents happy together.  This scene is the first that really spells out how poor her parent&#039;s relationship is.  Then she moves on to porn with her parents faces on the bodies.  From a very early age, she has sexualized the camera and the things she looks through it to see.  The identity through the camera becomes desensitized, and not as real.  This is one of the reasons that lead to the creation of porn with Lore&#039;s movie making skill.  Because her parents never touch, even the touch of porn seems better than no touch at all.&lt;br /&gt;
	Shifting forward chronologically, Lore&#039;s camera becomes a defense mechanism.  She carries it around with her all the time, and avoids both her mother and father&#039;s presences.  Her father stops taking her fishing, and her mother stops trying to talk business with her.  This is when a mutable object defines her identity.  Lore&#039;s identity is defined through her camera, which allows anything seen through its lens to be changed.  This doesn&#039;t allow for a strong sense of identity by lore.  This is also the period of her life where Lore starts dying her hair, another change to her identity that the camera led to.  The identity and defense mechanism comes to a head at Spanner&#039;s home.  During the sex orgy brought about by the drug, Lore is shielded from the action only by her camera.  That is when she realizes that the camera is not truly a shield.  She is still affected by her actions, even years later.  While Ruth nominally gave her permission, Ruth was still hurt by her act, which led to a break down in their relationship anyway.  Even with the identities changed on the other side of the camera, people can still be hurt in their true selves.&lt;br /&gt;
	The last and most important camera scene is the creation of the charity ad.  It creates a huge problem first off, because the equipment is so expensive.  It seems to say that it is extremely difficult to try to perceive things differently than they are.  Spanner gets all of her limbs forcibly dislocated and relocated to try to get the money for the equipment.  That just says another thing about the false identity that the camera can create.  It shows how much Spanner is reaching and trying for that false identity.  As this stage of the novel however, Lore is not making nearly the effort to try to get the equipment for the falsehood.  She has matured in enough ways that she no longer feels the need to hunt out the material to achieve falsehoods.  The charity ad itself is a large falsehood.  Starting with a false charity, where all the money goes to Spanner and Lore, and then being a false advertisement, in place of the show because the rest of the commercial space was filled, to being about a problem which, while real, was not personified by the person used to portray it.  Lore was trying to show the plight of the person born before 1960.  Her subject however, Tom, was fully integrated into his world and had no trouble at all living in it.  In fact, he quite enjoyed it.  The camera had to create a complete falsehood to be successful.  Then, when the ad was given to Tom along with his share of the cut, he did not watch it.  Instead he started on at the news with his impossibly clear eyes, full of truth, and did not watch the falsehood.  That was the last straw, and helped Lore to finally start to realize her true identity, and not an identity created through any kind of construction or lens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Rich people suck.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/237</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Slow River.  However, I also enjoy The Hills and America&#039;s Next Top Model, so this means very little.  I enjoyed it, but I didn&#039;t think it was particularly good.  The major issue I had with it was the apparent lack of a character arc for Lore.  As she is the protagonist, I assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with her; at least, I found no indication to the contrary.  I did not particularly like her, however, and there were some major flaws in her character that I thought needed more of a treatment than the book gave.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the story (chronologically), Lore is:&lt;br /&gt;
 a) mind-blowingly rich, and has all the easy naÃ¯ve carelessness of the aristocracy&lt;br /&gt;
b) mildly obsessed with sex&lt;br /&gt;
c) prideful and striving to prove herself to those around her (her family, the company)&lt;br /&gt;
d) unthinkingly supportive of the unfair and dangerous monopoly her family hold on the water purification system.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the novel, she is still all of these things.  She has apparently made the most progress in the &quot;mildly obsessed with sex&quot; category â€“ she has at least discovered love, to augment lust.  She has plenty of positive characteristics as well, obviously, but the above four were issues I expected to be addressed in her development that were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow River was unexpectedly pro-corporation.  The ethical dilemmas posed by the van de Oest monopoly on the genetically engineered water-purification system are obvious â€“ it allows blatantly artificial price inflation and the eradication of all competition.  None of the characters, besides the huddled masses in Venezuela, ever question the rightness of this.  We already went over this in class, so I will say no more; more interesting to me is the sense of entitlement and subtle arrogance that Lore displays throughout the book.  At her job on Hedon Road, she listens to her superiors speak with a condescending, critical air.  After nearly everything Hepple says as he gives her a tour the first day, she mentally disparages him with thoughts like, &quot;I had learned at age 12, from my uncle Willem, that in a properly run plant the average BOD should never be higher than two ppm, but I didn&#039;t say anything&quot; (30) and &quot;[Hepple was] a little tin god, lording it over his tiny domain.  He wouldn&#039;t have lasted more than a day on one of my projects&quot; (32).  In just these two statements, Lore reminds herself, and the reader, that as an adolescent she already knew better than Hepple, she is connected to the van de Oests, and if she was not in hiding, she would be in control of all her bosses&#039; fates.  With unthinking ease that comes with being of the super-elite, she places herself as superior to everyone else in the plant.  Even Magyar has to prove to Lore that she is not a complete idiot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore tells Magyar her true name, it is with a certain self-satisfied pride.  When Magyar reacts with anger, and not awe, Lore thinks, &quot;But I&#039;m Frances Lorien van de Oest!  Didn&#039;t she know what that meant?  She couldn&#039;t just dismiss me, as if I were anyone else...But she had.  Which is what I wanted, wasn&#039;t it - to be treated as a real person?&lt;br /&gt;
It is the closest Lore comes to self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finished reading, I found myself wondering if Lore&#039;s flat character was faulty writing or some kind of extraordinarily subtle criticism of the sheltered elite on Griffith&#039;s part.  I think that this is swerving dangerously close to trying to identify author&#039;s intent, so I will not attempt to answer that question; rather, I will only comment that Lore is quite an unusual character in a genre that is so often anti-establishment and subversive.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dealing with Vulnerability</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/235</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to tie together two issues we discussed briefly in class: Lore&#039;s seemingly overwhelming worry about being discovered and themes of environmentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her life with Spanner, Lore constantly worries about being recognized from the kidnappers&#039; videos: &quot;There was nothing specific of which she was afraid, just... everything, as though the world were a gelatinous beast that would fall upon her and suffocate her. The open spaces, the feeling that her back was naked, that people could see through her clothes, that someone would recognize her as the heiress who was kidnapped three or four months ago&quot; (86). Paragraphs of paranoid thoughts often culminate with worries that &quot;people might recognize her, might stare and point&quot; (57). Such behavior is understandable -- with the kidnapping and broadcasting of the videos, she went from an icon of premier social standing to an object of pity. Images of her in a weakened, suffering state flooded the market. According to a worldview where &quot;To look vulnerable was to be vulnerable&quot; (89),  being recognized from the pictures left Lore susceptible to more than just blackmail, but true emotional harm. She had internalized the image of the online photos -- the threatened and abused character in the kidnappers&#039; films is who she is, and she&#039;s afraid of others reconizing her, and in that recognition, confirming that identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emphasize the danger and power of this cycle, Lore has the model of Stella: &quot;To be used like a receptacle, a commodity, and to know it, to be helpless before it, and then to see that helplessness reflected back at her every time her eyes met her abuser&#039;s across the table, every time she saw herself in the mirror&quot; (292)... faced with such a situation, Lore understands why Stella chose to kill herself. Lore accepts this choice, and must prevent herself from being overhwelmed by shame from which she can never escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow River introduces two competing methods of dealing with this vulnerability. The first is a type of &#039;eat or be eaten&#039; mentality that drives Lore to reflect &quot;Everyone suffered. It was just a question of making sure she was using them, and not the other way around&quot; (85). Lore justifies seruptitiously videotaping her friends having sex with the rationale that they&#039;ve seen her in similar situations (197). In her relationship with Spanner, Lore learns how to manipulate her way into power, which parallels the tactics used by Greta and Katerine -- all of them focus on using others in order to avoid the conclusion that they were used and harmed by others. The alternative seems to be ecological. As Lore begins to tend her garden, she shows a strong departure from the previous mindset: &quot;Many of the weeds she left alone. They had fought to be there; she wasn&#039;t going to be the one to pull them out. Besides, they were green and growing&quot; (87). This respect for life, growth, and individual freedom contrasts sharply to the &#039;everyone is suffering, take what you can&#039; idea from before. As Lore continues to explore this new way of living, she begins to feel better about herself: instead of illicit activities that make her lips begin to curl like Spanner&#039;s (i.e. getting trapped into a cycle of hurt-or-be-hurt), she begins to recognize a need for &quot;wild things, natural things&quot; (113).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in exploring more about the satisfaction Lore finds in this new approach, as well as the seeming contrast between the &#039;natural&#039; and &#039;kill-or-be-killed&#039; lifestyle (isn&#039;t that how the animal world works?), but I&#039;m going to call it a night for now.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ain&#039;t no Cyberpunk</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/234</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It was pretty easy to expect, when I was first handed Lore as a trembling victim and Spanner as her fast-talking underworld coach, that the world of Slow River is a cyberpunk world in which one&#039;s identity implant is their life and loss of it turns one into a non-person. This isn&#039;t what Slow River is about at all. It&#039;s not cyberpunk at all, though aside from Neuromancer it&#039;s one of the few novels we&#039;ve run into that is set in a world not that much after our own, where space travel isn&#039;t an issue and earth and recognizable human technologies define the plane, scale and challenges of the novel.  Lore has never lost some widget of technology she couldn&#039;t regain. She doesn&#039;t glory in her life on the edge, and neither does the novel.  In fact, instead of being faced with the unknowability of the life and threat of the elite, we find her first with intimate knowledge of the world, rather than fighting desperately against it.  She chooses to hide from her former identity and her incredibly powerful family for other, far more tangled reasons, reasons that the story slowly peels back in layers. The psychological thickets underlying Lore&#039;s denial of her identity are the heart of a fascinating study of economic class, family secrets, friendship and loyalty, self-esteem, and self-created identity. This is not a cyberpunk identity thriller. Lore observes that she is a creature who has fallen from the tops of the jungle trees down into the lower layers of growth. What follows is simple, but an elegant metaphor in the body of the novel.  Each layer of the jungle is a different ecosystem; each has its own rules, its own predators, its own logic. Jungle creatures who fall out of their natural layer are completely unequipped for the world in which they find themselves, and often die miserable deaths. But the river that cuts through the center of the jungle also cuts through all of the layers, leaving open space where one can, if one chooses, see them all at once for what they are. It&#039;s a compelling metaphor for class and an interesting guide to Lore&#039;s emotional journey, and when Lore finds her emotional riverbank, the resonances echo back through the story and transform and improve the entire novel.&lt;br /&gt;
	Interestingly, the science in is water reclamation, and surprisingly, I find it riveting as presented by Griffith.  To be honest there is some passing reference to identity hacking, ransoming, and con games, but those bits of technology are indistinct supports for character and plot. Environmental engineering is the foregrounded science, and Lore&#039;s competence, dedication, and understanding makes it far from either boring or typically political. Not that it&#039;s NOT political. The politics here are about class, rather than purely about environmentalism, and even here the multinational corporation is more ambiguous than evil. Seen through Lore&#039;s eyes, the biological process of cleaning and recycling water takes on a complex, difficult beauty that had me looking forward to scenes of tromping about sewage treatment plants.  Go sewage rakes! Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;
	One thing I just have to mention about this book is how elegant the use of more-and-less subtle difference in P.O.V. is in this book.  Though confused along with the rest of you at being introduced to the same character at several different stages in her life, it allows you to move in and around the complex identity timeline of one person in a way that make me much more comfortable than any of the other books we&#039;ve read so far â€“ take, for example, Stars in my Pockets as an example of the opposite effect. As far as I have picked it apart, Slow River is told in three narrative strands with the same protagonist but separated in her life by time. The current story is told in the first person, the immediate background in tight third-person past tense, and Lore&#039;s childhood in a &quot;looser&quot; third-person present. Lore&#039;s childhood was a story told to her, her life with Spanner was a story pushed at her, and her life afterwards is the story she takes control of. It&#039;s that sort of book, full of parallels, symbolism, sideways approaches to questions of identity, and use of literary devices as cues.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>gender in slow river</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/226</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the topics we didn&#039;t discuss in class yet about Slow River, interestingly enough, is gender relations. Perhaps because the majority of the characters are female, this is not as obvious an issue as in earlier novels we&#039;ve read; most of the character interaction is between women, in effect denying the gender discussion. In this, however, Griffith makes the gender discussion simply different, rather than obsolete. The first obvious difference is the fact that the child abuser, the perpetrator of incest, is the mother of the family, not the father. It is a different twist that this is actually closer to the &quot;Oedipal form&quot; of the family than the norm; while we see the potential for incest, it is absolutely startling to imagine the female parent as the one abusing her power and her children, though in the original story, it is of course the mother and son who commit incest. What are the implications of this surprise? For one, it destroys the image of the perfect mother, the caring and nurturing soul that all women must be. While this is certainly not a positive image of woman, because it contrasts a stereotype it can still be considered useful in helping society change the way it perceives the genders. Further, sexual abuse is usually more about the power involved than the actual sexual act (though it can probably be assumed the perpetrator does derive pleasure from the act), once again going against the female stereotype. It is not the father in Lore&#039;s family who has the power, it is the mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one could argue that because the non-stereotypical ideas are portrayed by a rather negative character, Griffith shows women who act beyond &quot;their place&quot; are all bad. I don&#039;t see this as true, however, because while the main evil originates in female characters, so does the main good. Griffith is simply showing two things: women can be any sort of individual, rather than be fit into long-perpetrated ideals of delicacy and kindness; also, conversely, that good people and bad can be of any gender. Another thing we must realize, however, is that the nearly female world she created is not the complete world, and the real world has not yet thrown out the old ideas. When Lore attempts to team with Paolo against the corrupt Hepple, Paolo shouts, &quot; &#039;I don&#039;t need a woman to fight my battles!&#039; &quot; (172). Paolo can&#039;t accept the idea that Lore may be able to help him because she has more knowledge and confidence. To him, all that matters is that she is female, and that it is somehow disgraceful to elicit help from a woman. Lore is utterly shocked at his response, and understandably so: she has the means and the desire to help, but is refused on a rather trite condition. While the following quotation is not specifically about gender relations, it can be tied to them: &quot;I wondered how many more centuries it would take to break the physically-stronger-equals-morally-superior equation . . .&quot; (259). Historically, this has been a gender issue; men naturally have more muscle than women, which has determined much of how the world operates. In the modern era, however, physical strength means very little compared to strength of intellect, and yet those of better physical strength assume superiority. Lore quickly dismisses her thought rather cynically, assuming that humanity will, indeed, never change. This doesn&#039;t give us much hope for gender relations either, unless the intelligent weak(er) can somehow reach the assuming buff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note about relationships in general, it was interesting to read a novel in which all sexual encounters are between women. Not only do they happen rather frequently, but it is generally unusual and quite unheard of in our previous novels. The only vaguely heterosexual encounter is Lore&#039;s porn video of her parents, which was completely made up, as if she was trying to find some way such a relation could work. Also interestingly, the only scenes that occur in first person are between Lore and Magyar. This seems to suggest by the first person narrative either that finding someone who actually would love her helped Lore understand her identity, or the opposite: that in finding her identity, she found love.&lt;/p&gt;
