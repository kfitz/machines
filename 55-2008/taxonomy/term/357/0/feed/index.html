 <title>Response 10. Or maybe 9. Pattern Recognition.</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;A Few Thoughts on Pattern Recognition (potentially scattered, I apologize.)&lt;br /&gt;
One of the things that interested me most in Pattern Recognition was Gibson&#039;s recycling of his protagonist&#039;s name.  I know that we talked about this a little bit in class, but it was definitely one of the things that stuck out to me most about the novel (shoot me, I&#039;m not a Gibson fan!).  Also, I know that Gibson claims that he didn&#039;t do it on purpose.  But, I mean, come on! There are millions of names in the world and he has enough imagination to come up with whole new science-fiction realms.  I would think that he could at least think of a new name.&lt;br /&gt;
	So I decided to look up who exactly the Cayce who the Cayce of Pattern Recognition was named for.  Apparently, Edgar Cayce was a psychic from the early 20th century.  In that way, Cayce seems like a perfectly appropriate name for the protagonist of Pattern Recognition.  Obviously, her abilities are paranormal, although apparently coolhunter is not an expression invented by Gibson, but is actually a fairly common term for someone who is hired to predict trends (who knew?).&lt;br /&gt;
	I find myself wondering whether or not the use of the name Cayce was actually a pattern intended by Gibson.  Or is it simply a flash of apophenia?  By using the name again, Gibson seems to be inviting his readers to draw a connection between the two protagonists.  And their lives are, at times, disturbingly similar: two seemingly free-spirited professionals (one hacker, one coolhunter) are offered contracts. Action ensues.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, the novels&#039; endings are different enough that I didn&#039;t find myself immediately wanting to write Cayce&#039;s story off as the feminine version of Neuromancer.  (Obviously, there are tons of other differences--over-simplification for the point of a reading response.)  The end of Neuromancer intentionally veers away from a fairy-tale ending: Molly leaves Case, eliminating any possibility of a future between the two of them.  In contrast, the ending of Pattern Recognition seems to veer in the opposite direction: everything is worked out rather neatly, and Cayce finds romantic happiness and comes to terms with the disappearance of her father.  The ending might be why I found myself not liking Pattern Recognition as much as Neuromancer.&lt;/p&gt;
