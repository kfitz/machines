 <title>this was meant to be a respone...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;...This was meant to be a response to the long thread of comments on the entry titled, &quot;The extension of human masculinity,&quot; but it became this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to watch people get so riled up about gender in class.  I understand that some people believe it&#039;s a social construct and that stereotypes are evil, etc. etc., but I think that this belief in gender and the stereotypes attached to each one is so deeply ingrained, that there&#039;s no point in arguing aimlessly about it.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m maybe not going to make any sense when I try to explain this, but I&#039;m going to try... So in my Lit Theory class today (or yesterday, technically speaking), we were discussing Nietsche&#039;s and Frost&#039;s ideas on metaphors.  Metaphors are so common in our everyday language that we don&#039;t even notice them anymore (ie. &quot;She&#039;s a warm person.&quot;  Life as a journey can be extended to the statement &quot;I&#039;m lost.&quot;).  Ultimately, metaphors stabilize and give meaning to our perceptions by helping us understand things in relation to other ones.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Left Hand of Darkness and Lilith&#039;s Brood, the metaphors are the references to gender that the authors make.  Here&#039;s one to refresh your memory: &quot;Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit&quot;(LeGuin 12)&lt;br /&gt;
While I do not doubt that authors like Butler and LeGuin may be trying to provoke us with these gendered non-gender beings, maybe they&#039;re also just providing supposedly male, or supposedly female attributes, so that WE, as readers, can engage in and better understand (and maybe even empathize with?) these aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>language and meaning in the left hand of darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/145</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness may be about gender, and it may be about weather, but it&#039;s also very clearly about the schism between words and real world referents. The vocabulary that LeGuin uses to describe this poststructuralist phenomenon is &quot;veneer.&quot; This comes up first during the description of Argaven&#039;s jingoistic speeches, in which he advocates for war without, we are told repeatedly and in a way that starts to grate by the end of the book, being able to say the word &quot;war.&quot; Ai points out that it&#039;s interesting, then, for Argaven to be so concerned with notions of capital-T &quot;Truth,&quot; given the fact that his oratory consists in large part of deception: &quot;He talked a great deal about Truth also, for he was, he said, &#039;cutting down beneath the veneer of civilization&#039;&quot; (102).&lt;br /&gt;
	This pretty much sets Ai off. He really does not, evidently, appreciate hearing Argaven talk about truth or, we find out, about &quot;veneer&quot;: &quot;It is a durable, ubiquitous, specious metaphor, that one about veneer (or paint, or pliofilm, or whatever) hiding the nobler reality beneath. It can contain a dozen fallacies at once&quot; (102). Genly Ai&#039;s complaint, then, is that the &quot;veneer&quot; argument--the argument about an obfuscating something-or-other that&#039;s always blocking from view the true nature of things--is itself a bit of empty rhetoric, something that nobody if pressed is really sure what to make of. Here, Ai proves himself wrong even as he delivers a deft criticism. There is, clearly, an obfuscating something-or-other, a &quot;veneer,&quot; but it has to do with language; with metaphor, perhaps; with one&#039;s ability to say what one means; not with, as Argaven too-broadly claims, &quot;civilization.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The book gives two very elaborate and drawn-out examples of how language comes to obscure meaning. The first of these is the concept of &quot;shifgrethor.&quot; LeGuin throws out a lot of made up words to stand in for objects and ideas in the community of TLHoD, but this is the only one that strikes me as sort of ingenious. The only definition of &quot;shifgrethor&quot; we are ever given doesn&#039;t really completely square with how the word gets used in conversation between characters--but this is perhaps because the term is only obliquely defined, is defined as, in a sense, indefinable--&quot;prestige, face, place, the pride-relationship, the untranslatable and all-important principle of social authority&quot; (14). Great. So we have a narrator who&#039;s in the unique position to tell us that there&#039;s an &quot;all-important principle&quot; that governs everything going on in the weird universe of this book, but who&#039;s also totally unable to really accurately say what it is or what it might mean in practice. It turns out usually--though definitely not always; &quot;shifgrethor can be played on the level of ethics,&quot; too (106)--to mean something like the secret rules that govern conversation, something like etiquette. The conversation at Genly&#039;s dinner with Estraven--which is the ostensible context and impetus for Genly&#039;s first defining &quot;shifgrethor&quot;--gets revisited several times in the book, with the common realization between the two characters that neither really had any idea at the time what the other was saying.&lt;br /&gt;
	The other salient example is the phenomenon of mindspeech, which is, of course, alien to Gethen, but which Genly Ai introduces at least to Estraven. The experience turns out to be wildly uncomfortable for Estraven, whose socially ingrained mode of communication involves what Genly Ai charitably calls &quot;reserve&quot; (255). The idea is that all Gethenians are going to hate mindspeech because it doesn&#039;t allow for falsification, for the sort of rhetorical play that &quot;shifgrethor&quot; necessarily entails. This tells us two things: (1) socially, and specifically with respect to Gethenian cultures, lying is a lot more comfortable than telling the truth, and pure meaning sort of sucks; and (2) objectively, throughout the universe of TLHoD, it&#039;s the transmutation--transubstantiation?--of ideas into words that allows for the fucking up of meaning.&lt;br /&gt;
	Genly Ai observes all of this about Gethenian culture. He observes that obfuscating rhetoric is absolutely the cultural norm. He also points out one really weird counterexample--of Kundershaden, the prison, he says: &quot;[i]t is what it looks like and is called. It is a jail. It is not a front for something else, not a faÃ§ade, not a pseudonym. It is real, the real thing, the thing behind the words&quot; (166). Aside from the fact that this seems to be making a sort of stupid and demonstrably false assumption about how language signifies, what I find really interesting here is that the only physical, cultural counterexample that Genly seems to be able to hit upon is a prison. I&#039;m not really sure what to make of this. In his experience, the only thing that is cold and hard and not covered up by the play of language is the locus of state power.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>To oppose is to maintain, and blue eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/143</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The issues of duality, competition, war, and progress bring to mind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.love-shy.com/Gilmartin/Chapter03/elliot.html&quot;&gt;Jane Elliott &quot;blue eyes&quot; classroom study&lt;/a&gt;. That link is knowledgeable, but not the most approachable, so let me summarize. In order to teach a lesson on discrimination to a homogenous Iowa elementary school classroom, she began an experiment where she declared children with blue eyes &#039;better&#039; than the others. After a short speech about the weaknesses of brown eyed children, she continued with the day&#039;s lesson, taking every chance to confirm the blue eyes assumed superiority and call out brown eyes&#039; negative behavior as representative of their kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications are wide (and the study has its critics, of course), but I wanted to focus on the measurable changes in performance that accompanied the experiment. By the end of that first school day, measurements of math, vocabulary, and reading proficiency all showed major change from where the students were one week before: the brown eyed students&#039; scores fell drastically (e.g. regressing from a 3rd to a 1st grade reading level) and the blue eyed scores rose dramatically (e.g. improving the a 5th grade reading level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interpretation I buy into states that this only happened because our children learn at an early age that there are better and worse groups of people in our world. Classification, competition, and discrimination are functions used by our society, because they have positive effects for the &#039;better&#039; group! So how do we break out of this system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turn to what Le Guin says in The Left Hand of Darkness: &quot;To oppose something is to maintain it. [One] must offer an alternative&quot; (153). A critique of the current system is pointless without proposing other options. From the very introduction of the book she describes the importance of &quot;the imagination&quot; (i). An alternative biology, interactions with other species, the general concept of a science fiction tale about the futureâ€¦ all of these are metaphors geared toward imagining different futures in order to change the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we&#039;ve already begun a good discussion on exactly what alternative Le Guin offers. In her world, &quot;There is no division of humanity into strong and weak halves, protective/protected, dominant/submissive, owner/chattel, active/passive (94). The total breakdown of the classify/compete/discriminate system does slow the society down in some ways â€“ Genly often describes the Gethenians as slightly slower, weaker, and less advanced (50, 103) â€“ but best achieves Le Guin&#039;s ultimate value of civilization (something like &#039;the open trade of ideas, techniques, material goods/technology, and culture&#039; based on pages 34-35, 103, and 137-138). Maybe &#039;achieves&#039; is the wrong word. I think Le Guin is offering this future with hope, painting it in a good light. However, the &#039;good&#039;/&#039;bad&#039; judgment here is definitely process-oriented, not result-oriented, as based on 50, 102, and 259.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. S. Final reason I love this book? Le Guin gets special relativity right. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gender Pronouns in The Left Hand of Darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/141</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout her novel, Ursula LeGuin mainly uses the masculine set of pronouns, he and him.  This seems strange for a novel set on winter, an androgyne world.  Why did LeGuin not create her own set of gender pronouns for use in the novel?  Couldn&#039;t the use of such words lessen the bias that the reader had to a specific gender?  LeGuin had many reasons for her choice of pronouns, and use of he as the main pronoun helps rather than hurts the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reason for the use of he instead of she is to counteract her natural bias.  The left hand of darkness was one of LeGuin&#039;s first books.  Her skills as a writer had not matured yet, so, writing characters as a specific gender was difficult.  Just as in science fiction written by men with women heroines, science fiction about men written by women tends to trivialize the parts, an characterize them as stereotypes rather than characters in their own right.  Worse than that, especially with characters written in first person, they may take on some of the traits of the writer.  This leads to male characters appearing female.  In the first chapter, Genly appears female, because that was how he seemed written.  The use of male pronouns however, quickly disabused me of that notion and allowed me to think him equal, and a more gender balanced character.  Estraven, written as an androgyne, appeared completely male in the first part of the book.  This was helped by the usage of the male pronouns whenever referring to him.  However, when LeGuin started writing Estraven with first person narrative, he seemed more feminine.  This was mostly because he was written by LeGuin, whose traits seeped into her writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had LeGuin felt it necessary to invent a set of gender neutral pronouns, she would have.  She invented so many terms for use in the novel hat a few more would have been completely acceptable, and maybe even useful.  For instance, she coined the terms ansible, a term still in use today, Ekumen, and the days weeks and months of her fictional cultures.  The creation of a few gender unspecific pronouns would not have been difficult.  LeGuin had created most of her invented terms in Gethenian languages.  There were gender unspecific terms in those languages, so she could easily have pulled them out and stated that they were now used in English too.  But Genly never uses that sort of pronoun.  Instead he uses he or LeGuin writing uses he.  This is to draw attention to something specific about Homo sapiens, current life on earth.  Faced with a gender that is impossible to understand normally, the human response is not to categorize it as something new, but rather to try to pigeonhole it into something old that already exists.  Throughout the first part of the novel, Genly categorizes anyone he meets into a gender.  He has a landlady, the men in the government are well, men, and so on.  He is categorizing something that really should not be categorized in that way.  LeGuin is pointing out a fallacy in the human condition when she categorizes her androgyne characters with the pronoun he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even with all her reasons, the use of he throughout LeGuin&#039;s novel can lead to complications.  The novel has not always been interpreted as a feminist novel, even though igender equality is on of its main tenets.  In her novel Winter&#039;s King, she originally used he in instance of gender pronoun.  Later, she switched it to she in every case for dome parity.  Overall though, LeGuin did a good job of using gender pronouns in her work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Being Other in the Other&#039;s eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/140</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating interplay between light and dark, and the role of shadows in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot;  Perhaps most interesting is the concept of shifgrethor, a code of honor amongst the Karhidians, which &quot;comes from an old word for shadow&quot; (247).    There is also, among the Handdarata, a focus on the &quot;un&quot;--that which seems to be the opposite of what is.  In many respects, the Karhidians seem to be defined more by what they are not, by what is unseen, and by what traditionally is thought to obscure.  It is a society that thrives through the unknown, through the unspoken (&quot;Secrecy in Karhide is to an extraordinary extent a matter of discretion, of an agreed, understood silence--an omission of questions, yet not an omission of answers&quot; (287.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is just human nature, perhaps it is a result of the weather, perhaps it is a result of a society of kemmering, not static sex assignments.  Whatever the underlying reasons are, though, this shadow life is something that the primary narrator, Genly Ai, does not understand for the bulk of the story, and which separates him from the others around him.  Likewise, this keeps others from truly understanding or questioning him.  It is not until Genly and Estraven have been a long while on the Ice that this cold wall between them begins to break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the text, the reader is presented with Genly&#039;s arguably problematic gendered perceptions of the world around him, ascribing his own frame of reference to a people that defies and in many ways destroys that frame of reference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is also something deeply unsettling about Genly for the inhabitants of Winter.  There is King Argaven&#039;s political fear and distrust of Genly&#039;s differences (34-40), and likewise his physical differences are noted by other characters over the course of his story.  It is not until Estraven and Genly have escaped to the Ice, though, and a friendship based on sheer mutual survival begins to develop, that we get any insight into how Genly is perceived, not as The Alien Envoy, but as an individual who is different.  Estraven&#039;s comments on gender at this juncture are perhaps the most interesting in the entire novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven&#039;s comments on Genly fall into two categories: the physical and the spirit, as it pertains to the body.  When Estraven himself is in kemmer, he reflects on Genly, musing &quot;A strange lowgrade sort of desire it must be, to be spread out over every day of the year, and never to know the choice of sex&quot; (232).    This sentiment seems to get to the heart of the conflict between the two depictions of sex and gender.  Estraven, when speaking of &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; means choosing male or female, not being arbitrarily assigned to one for all of life.  This flux between physical states of being seems to hearken back to the predominance of shadows in the Karhidian culture.  The flux between being sexed and androgynous also bears with it a very strong cycle of emotion, with the intensity of sexuality while in kemmer, and the utter lack of a sex drive when not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet reading the phrase &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; as one Genly&#039;s breed of humanity, I first read it as &quot;the choice to have sex, or not have sex.&quot;  Were the phrase uttered by Genly instead of Estraven, this would be a valid interpretation, as the Gethenians are as captive to their expression of sexuality by time as we are by sex assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven also ties Genly&#039;s sex to his physical and spiritual (not religious, but of the spirit) abilities.  He says &quot;There is a frailty about him.  He is all unprotected, exposed, vulnerable, even to his sexual organ which he must carry always outside himself; but he is strong, unbelievably strong.  I am not sure he can keep hauling any longer than I, but he can haul harder and faster than Iâ€¦To match his frailty and strength, he has a spirit easy to despair and quick to defiance; a fierce impatient courage&quot; (227-8).  Given Genly Ai&#039;s fairly constant comment on the slowness of life, evolution, and time on Winter, Estraven&#039;s understanding of Genly is particularly profound.  He has seen in an example of one what that one could not understand in an entire world.  Yet even this understanding of Genly&#039;s spirit is seen through the filter of the Gethenians.  Where Estraven sees frailty and physical vulnerability, our society has placed virility and strength.  Even when there is a deep personal connection between individuals, they are both still coming to one another from such different perspectives as to never be able to truly understand one another.  Though Genly spends much of the end of the book speaking of the universal human spirit, of &quot;serving Mankind&quot; (293), not just one nation or race, there are still deep differences between the races.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most telling indicator of the split between the Gethenians and Genly is that Estraven, in his times of deep emotion, of mind-connection, and in death, returns Genly&#039;s love for him by displacing his brother, Arek, onto Genry Ai, particularly in the mind-connection, where it is impossible to tell lies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might paint an initially bleak picture of the hope for understanding between Peoples at first glance, in between the arguments, running as a thread throughout, is the desire and hope for understanding.  Though this understanding might be doomed to be imperfect, on both sides, there is the effort, and the emotions created are very real.  We may never be able to walk in the Other&#039;s shoes, but there is the hope of walking along side him, and recognizing that he too must wear shoes, different though they may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much to think about when ur stuck in the ice...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/138</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still interested in what happens in this novel in terms of race, and the representation of racial issues in the future.  We might of tried to touch on it in class, but the overwhelming struggle over the meaning and the philosophy of gender in society was definitely something that took over.  It clearly has for almost all readers of the novel, down to the feminist writers who proclaimed that Le Guin&#039;s use of the male pronoun was the number one most anti-feminist act of all time.  I&#039;m not sure how many people shared my first impression, that race is something of a stagnant, bypassed, non-issue; but as we&#039;ve seen from Starship Troopers, race can be expected to take on a number of different appearances and undergo a number of different transformations in its manifestation in any brave new sci-fi world.  So I was/am suspicious that more is going on here in terms of racial politics than meets the eye.  I&#039;m of the opinion that talking about gender separately from race is inherently problematic, since all aspects of identity (but I would say these two in particular) are inextricable from one another.  They all intersect.&lt;br /&gt;
	Since one of the things that third-wave feminist literature (of member of which group this novel is ostensibly a part, according to its retrospective classification by people other than Le Guin) is reacting to is the failing of second-wave feminist literature to extend a critique of gender to other social structures, I tend to presume a consciousness in the work of the ways in which gender cannot stand alone from an issue like race.  But where do we see this in the work?&lt;br /&gt;
	On the one hand we certainly have some of the Star Trek &quot;federation&quot; model of race-overcome in Le Guin&#039;s universe, at least in the abstract and far-off body of the Ekumen.  Genly&#039;s elegant turn of phrase is not unfamiliar: &quot;we come all colors&quot; (39).  Genly himself is (to me) a typical Le Guin protagonist in that he is revealed to be dark-skinned, presumably of African descent, several pages into the novel.  Surprise, he&#039;s not Caucasian!  I think one of the passing comments in class was very accurate: Le Guin does do a certain recognizable amount of messing with what she knows are going to be the reader&#039;s assumptions, and revealing them to the reader in such a way as to make us unable to deny the systems that inform our reading of any text.  It&#039;s interesting to me here that Genly&#039;s race is one of the &quot;unsettling revelations&quot; she chooses to make, in a style similar to that in which it was casually dropped in that &quot;...even in a *bisexual society* the politician is very often something less than an integral man...&quot; (20).&lt;br /&gt;
	On the other hand, we still have what seem to be remnants of bizarre racial stereotyping worked into the novel, though in some cases I think I&#039;m willing to put it down to less-than-conscious decisions by the author.  I&#039;m not the only person to notice the Gethenian specific inability to differentiate between the &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds, or the Chinese-imperialist-style royal city-within-a-city (as evidenced in various places on the blog so far).  Bizarre referencing of &quot;oriental&quot; stereotypes, it feels like.  These are only a few instances of several when I felt a correlation between a familiar stereotype and Le Guin&#039;s fleshing out of the people of Winter in detail.  There&#039;s also the King&#039;s fascination with not only Genly&#039;s &quot;sexual perversion&quot; but his skin color, which is a troubling icon of difference to the King, alongside Genly&#039;s maleness.&lt;br /&gt;
	It&#039;s also important, I think, to keep in mind the *literal* presence and intersection of race and gender here.  To Genly Ai and the world he represents, the people of Winter are literally a different *race* of human.  The manifested differences in gender and sex, as well as various other less-novel physical traits of the Gethenians are in this way categorized as *race* differences. It&#039;s just an interesting thing to try and pick apart, since the Ekumen feels in many ways like a believable future for humanity.  Race isn&#039;t actually easy to define now, and I could easily see it undergoing a transformation of meaning and definition faced with a new and changing universe.&lt;br /&gt;
	On a slightly different note, I enjoyed the book immensely, especially since its purpose seemed to be to disrupt the reader.  I think I love this book simply as an exercise in breaking down societal givens, rather than a treatise on the inherent nature of man (human) or an attempt to solidify any one problem with modern society by reflecting it in dystopia or utopia.  It&#039;s open-ended, and though we see through Genly Ai&#039;s eyes, it is much easier to experience the world with a sense of wonder and perhaps discomfort that feel much easier to separate from the protagonist&#039;s own rationalization of the world than say, The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, in which we cannot seem to escape Offred&#039;s head and social isolation.  Interesting, since both main characters narrate their own stories precisely as stories, and both tales are conceived of as direct reports which stand as evidence for a past, unreachable experience.  I can&#039;t seem to grasp at why that is, except perhaps that the literal unseating of a gender (or sex?) dichotomy is the more novel to us, the more confrontational and the newest frontier to the reader themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Weather Versus Ambisexuality in The Left Hand of Darkness</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/137</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ursula Le Guin, though she makes a big fuss out of the &quot;thought-experimental&quot; nature of her novel, and explicitly says that she&#039;s not trying to make a political statement such as &quot;we damned well ought to be androgynous&quot; - but even so, she seems to intentionally pad levels of ambiguity â€“ maybe even excuses, plausible deniability â€“ into any possible &quot;message&quot; of her novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest features of Gethenian society that seems to contain a hidden moral supposition is this: &quot;they [do] not go to war&quot; (48). The clarification: &quot;they behaved like animals, in that respect, or like women&quot; (48) â€“ the mention of women especially hints that Gethenians are incapable of going to war because they are too feminine, and women don&#039;t go to war. (Personally, I don&#039;t take that for granted, but for the sake of argument, I&#039;ll let it go.) The problem is that their peculiar androgyny is not the only defining feature of Gethenian culture â€“ they also live in probably the coldest environment among the novel&#039;s known inhabited planets. It is a well-supported theory in life outside this novel that geography and environment are determining features of culture (see: &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;); and that makes it believable that the Gethenian inability to mobilize is the result of their weather. Consider: going to war is an enormous undertaking; oftentimes in the past, wars had to be postponed during winter months. Part of what made Hannibal an amazing general is that he managed to cross the Alps, which are snowy all year round, and even then his army suffered massive losses. The Gethenians would have to face that sort of weather everywhere, almost all the time; war would be a massively wasteful, unproductive undertaking for them, in comparison to our wars (and that&#039;s assuming that real wars are productive!). It&#039;s impossible to rule, therefore, that their androgyny is what makes Gethenians unwarlike; but it&#039;s also impossible to rule out that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within the novel, &quot;it seems likely that [the Gethenians are] an experiment&quot; (89). But what kind of experiment are they? If they were meant to be set up in opposition to other humans, then the experiment is critically flawed, because there is no strict control â€“ there are two variables, ambisexuality and extremely cold weather. For a realistic scientific experiment, the constraints are too loose, for the reasons I&#039;ve already spelled out. However, the idea that Gethenians exist on account of &quot;human genetic manipulation&quot; (89) is a convenient one for avoiding difficult issues such as proposing that such an evolution from humans is possible, likely, or natural. Otherwise, one might suppose that Ursula Le Guin was suggesting that humans would eventually become this way; or that humans could just have easily turned out this way. But instead, she sets down the opposite notion: that this sort of thing is nigh-impossible, and exists by mere contrivance. She calls attention to the falseness of the situation in such a way that it seems to discredit value judgments of any kind. The Gethenians are not explicitly better or worse, by any standards, than normal humans; they are just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this sort of thing is all over the novel. It&#039;s almost as if Le Guin knows she&#039;s treading on sensitive ground here, and so she restrains herself from making any claims that could be construed as outrageous. Whether in doing so, she undermines the meaningfulness of her novel or allows it to be all the more insidiously thought-provoking is anyone&#039;s guess.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ekumen and Religion?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/134</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Warning: I am feverish and have induced a headache from a superfluous amount of coughing, so I apologize if this entry is kind of wonky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first was reading The Left Hand of Darkness, I didn&#039;t really give the word/concept of &quot;Ekumen&quot; much thought.  A little bit later in the book, however, a derivation of the word was given as &quot;Ekumenical.&quot;  This jumped out at me and reminded me of the word, &quot;ecumenical,&quot; for which I (courtsey of OED) will provide a definition: belonging to or representing the whole (Christian) world; general; universal, Catholic; belonging to the whole world; universal, general, world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Ursula Le Guin is an atheist, I believe that the portrayal and role of the Ekumen as the Catholic Church is one that is subject to criticism or satire.  The narrow-mindedness of Catholicism is represented through the narrow-mindedness of the Ekumen&#039;s envoy, Genly Ai, who cannot quite grasp the lack of opposites on Winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ekumen, according to Genly, seeks &quot;the enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God&quot; (34).  I thought it really sounded like the Catholic Church when, on 136, he explains that the Ekumen is not a government, though it may share some similarities to one: &quot;It is an attempt to reunify the mystical with the political, and as such is of course mostly a failure; but its failure has done more good for humanity so far...It is a society and it has, at least potentially, a culture.  It is a form of education...it&#039;s a sort of a very large school...in another aspect it&#039;s a league or union...possessing some degree of centralized conventional organization.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get the impression that the Ekumen is preoccupied with progress.  It is very much concerned with economical profits and gains, and only invites worlds to join if they are sufficiently enlightened or open to enlightenment (both religion-wise and technologically).  While some aspects of the Gethenien world are antiquated (Karhide is described as being  in a &quot;dark age&quot; [115]), others are not.  Orgoreyn is more industrialized, with standardized clothing.  Genly observes that &quot;This, now, looked like a country ready to enter Ekumenical age&quot; (115).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s interesting that in Christianity, it is God who created binaries.  He first made Adam, then Eve, a female counterpart.  Everything comes in opposites and in pairs.  The ambisexual/ambigender? inhabitants of Winter are supposedly the result of some experiment conducted by previous colonists.  This dualism and subsequent lack of binaries, though created by humans, seems to be better (in some respects) than the world created by God (no rape, no war, everyone gets pregnancy leave from work....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the random bits of Gethenien folklore or mythology, I felt, read like stories from the Bible.  With the story about the Therems and the ending of the book, I got the impression that Estraven was kind of like the prodigal son.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thing I thought was interesting: The drink called &quot;lifewater&quot;...I don&#039;t know if LeGuin knows this, but &quot;whiskey&quot; (uisge beatha) in Scottish Gaelic translates as &quot;water of life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Left Hand of Darkness Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/128</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that was touched on in class recently was the way in which Genly Ai often characterized the ways the Gethenieas acted around him. Particularly interesting to me were the ways that appeared derogatory towards woman, and what this conveys about him and the &#039;Ekumenical&#039; society he comes from.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first that caught my attention appeared on page 48-9, when Genly is describing the Karhiders&#039; absence of war.  He says that, &quot;They lackedâ€¦the capacity to mobilize.  They behaved like animals in that respect; or like woman.  They do not behave like men, or ants.&quot;  In this comparison, he act in a similar manner to Starship Trooper&#039;s Johnny, placing woman on a level seemingly below men when it comes to being able to fight wars.  This is on an even larger scale though; whereas Johnny discredits them as not being infantry or front-line fighters, Genly appears to not seem a woman capable of mobilizing towards war at all.  Similarly, near the end of the novel (pg 299), he describes the first person he meets in the Estre Hearth as so silent that, &quot;no girl could keep so grim a silence as he did.&quot;  This is an oddly conspicuous comment, especially with so little basis in why he would think this way. This little off-hand remark helps lets us infer much about Genlys background.  Later in the novel, Genly confesses to Estreven that he understands very little about woman at all, inferring some trouble he may have had in the past in relationships or meetings with woman in general.  He has his own perception of woman from is own experience, not some grandiose utopian notion of equality or acceptance.  Does this reflect then more on his personal experience, or on the nature of the Ekumen he comes from?&lt;br /&gt;
	In my opinion, the fact that he makes these observations makes the society from which he comes from much more believable as a human future.  At first, at least to me, the Ekumenical system he is from seems overly optimistic.  A large, constantly expanding society with sizeable gaps in technology among several different races, even those with a common genetic background, seems unlikely to be so peaceful, and this makes it unbelievable to me.  Were it not for Genlys infrequent, not-so-PC references, I would have a lot of trouble connecting to the society as a whole.  The references themselves are what make him a human, imperfect and opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll pass on this reading response. I guess &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; just doesn&#039;t strike my fancy. It could also be lack of sleep. I KNOW I&#039;ll have something to say about &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood,&quot; so it&#039;s OK.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gethenians and Bugs</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I had been pondering in class, but didn&#039;t really get around to talking about was a comparison between the Bugs of Starship Troopers and the Gethenians.  I was considering how we responded very differently, as did the protagonists, to the bugs and the Gethenians and what some of the factors are that go into that.  In class we were describing the Gethenians as so very different from us, but at the same time, according to Le Guin&#039;s constructed biological family tree both the people of Terran and the people of Gethen were descended from the same people of Hain, and Genly can &quot;pass&quot; as being a native of the planet, if a slightly strange one.  (That also brings up the idea of &quot;passing,&quot; which is an incredibly loaded discussion both in considering race and gender/sexuality, but I don&#039;t have the stamina or inclination to go there right now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bugs had a similarly binary sexuality, even though separated by caste, so there were the drones and warriors - who we assume are male - and then the queen, obviously female.  Perhaps it is that the Bugs were so much like insects that we barely compared them to ourselves, but it struck me as strange that we mentioned how different the Gethenians were when Estraven states that from a visible standpoint, and even in some cultural aspects, they&#039;re extremely similar, it&#039;s the inner biology that so very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if this makes sense to anyone else, but it stuck out as a thought during discussion today that we seemed more comfortable with the idea of an insect race of aliens with identifiable and stable genders that we can clearly categorize and compare to something familiar.  And we seemed highly uncomfortable with the idea of this fluctuating gender and the accompanying foreign changes that result from it in society, even though solely by physical appearance the Gethenians should have been so much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d be happy to hear any thoughts, as mine aren&#039;t really formed into a single cohesive argument at all.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;
