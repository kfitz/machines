 <title>Slow River Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/242</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest questions of morality I saw (and the class talked about) was how Lore never acknowledges the other side of the monopoly argument.  As far as she is concerned, since the van de Oest products are superior to the others, they have the right to dominate the market.  As the son of two educators from a middleclass family, this was about as opposite my thought patterns as possible. The grand revelation she has about her family&#039;s rise to monopoly was all focused on the corruption behind it, not on the nature of the monopoly itself.  This was even after all of her work with Spanner and at the water-purification facility.  The way that Hepple acts is nearly identical to the way the younger Lore reacts to the worker problems on the Russia job, and to her own mother&#039;s response to the families of the children crippled by mistakes in the purification systems.  Between having a peon-level job and having such a money-grubbing, careless boss as Hepple,  I would have thought she would come to revise her opinion of her family&#039;s methods at least a little.  But no, the fault was in Hepple not choosing the expensive superior brand, not the producer&#039;s fault in making the bacteria absolutely dependent on one set of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  After all of her time spent on money schemes with Spanner, it surprised me that she would be naÃ¯ve enough to never recognize how much of a chokehold this kind of production has on the market.  I would say that she believed that her family would never stoop so low as to extort their buyers unjustly, but the way she herself describes her family&#039;s instabilities and lack of empathy rules this out.  She is an odd mix of self-consciousness, guilt, and bewilderment, and only resolves to change at the end of the novel.  Even then, this change is more of an acceptance of the way she feels than an actual resolution to make change things.  I am not saying that this isn&#039;t a monumental step for her, but I just thought things would turn out differently, perhaps with a bit more of a wide-scale change in the world.  Having finally sorted out the true story, she finally decides to return to her family and money, but takes with her the woman representative of all of her struggles.  It just seems like everything worked out too happily for her.  Also, I would like to know more about everyone she left behind, specifically Tom, Kinnis, Cel, and Hepple too.  I was wondering if anything would happen between her and Tom, romantic or not, even with her prior sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>dependence and self</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/238</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The theme of dependence is dominant from the start in Lore&#039;s relationship with Spanner. She arrives &quot;naked and nameless in the city.&quot; (5) When she first encounters Spanner, she is lying on the gorund, utterly helpless. Spanner nearly leaves her, but finally decides to help. Then, as Lore goes back to Spanner&#039;s home, she realizes that she &quot;needed this woman, Spanner; depended on her, in a way that was shocking.&quot; (11) For Lore, a child of privelege, confident in her education and her ability, this is a very difficult situation to accept. It is made even harder by the fact that she quickly finds herself in Spanner&#039;s debt, and forced to agree to join in her illegal activities in order to pay that debt. Her dependence is brought home to her by the fact that, while Spanner does ask her if she is willing, in reality she has no choice because she has nowhere else to turn.&lt;br /&gt;
    As Lore&#039;s relationship with Spanner continues, her dependence on Spanner for everything, from a place to hide to her goals and purpose every day begin to conflict with the individual she was before. Just before Spanner begins to teach her to steal, Lore meets Hyn and Zimmer, two fences. At first she doesn&#039;t know what to say, but then &quot;her early training, the endless meetings with local and national dignitaries, took over.&quot; (83) Then though, she is reminded of her dependence on Spanner, and she seems to draw away from her training. Subsequently, the two go out to steal slates, and Lore is taking her cues on what to say and how to act from Spanner. She listens to the other&#039;s stories, and uses her tactics. Her training is now essentially useless, and her dependent state causes her to develop, in a way, a new persona.&lt;br /&gt;
    Eventualy, Lore does make her way out from Spanner&#039;s shadow. This takes place over a period of time, and of course involves her finally getting a job and her own place to live, and all the steps she takes to pay Spanner back. However, I think the whole process may have begun somewhat earlier, in a surprising way. When Lore and Spanner go into the porn shop under their flat, we see for the first time Lore beginning to assert herself. While they are in the shop, she keeps making derogatory comments about the quality of the porn - &quot;I can do better than that;&quot; &quot;I was doing better work than this three years ago,&quot; (173) and so on. And Spanner responds. Lore&#039;s knowledge and ability have impressed her, and clearly given her the idea to have lore make better porn. Of course, at this time in the story Lore is still very much dependent on Spanner. However, by finally going back to something from her past, something of herself that is valuable and unique, she takes the first steps in psychologically freeing herself from that dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Gray-haired Burden</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/233</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since it has not really been addressed yet, the question of race in Slow River is a very interesting one.  As someone else mentioned, the gender dynamic is a departure from what we have been reading because Griffith creates an arguably homonormative environment where Lore&#039;s life is inundated with lesbian friends and even an uncle with a husband, demonstrating the total acceptance of gay marriage in this society.  As far as race, it is not an issue in any of the main or love interest characters.  The character of Paolo and the parts of the narrative of Lore&#039;s past that set up his identification are the most notable admission of the existence of non-White individuals in the van de Oest world.  In other areas of the novel, countries are mentioned where the van de Oest family has projects going on, including local labor disputes and the outcry after the Caracas affair.  But as far as being a central theme of the book, race is simply not as important to Griffith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this is perhaps done on purpose by Griffith.  Since we see the story through Lore&#039;s eyes and are repeatedly reminded of how her family operates, it may be a way to demonstrate the non-existence of Other to the van de Oest family.  While Lore did her best to educate herself and read about the biological intricacies of the family business, anything so outlandish as ethics or anthropological studies seem to have been left out.  As far as the corporation is concerned, the people of Caracas are relatively inconsequential to the long lasting goals of their remediation projects, and more honestly, their goals of protecting their monopoly by creating dependent bugs.  This lack of concern for fellow human beings is especially apparent in the character of Greta, who sells, and essentially destroys, her sister&#039;s life in order to secure the financial future of a particular project which is only a part of the family&#039;s business.  This forces the reader to understand in no uncertain terms that the family has not sought to inspire a significant moral compass in their offspring, as the pursuit of morals and the pursuit of insane wealth rarely seem compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the idea of race in the book, one might also consider the more general pattern of identifying people based on physical characteristics.  Socially, we are trained to read certain traits and assign people labels, slip them into categories based on the shape of a nose, the color of skin, or the size and shape of eyes.  Interestingly, the labels and categories do vary depending on country, but it seems to be more of an overarching theme of human nature to label and categorize.  The idea of the gray hair as a new symbol of wealth was an interesting choice for Griffith and seemed to be her way of hammering home the arrangement of priorities for the van de Oest family.  In some ways they become their own race (or they have just excused themselves from being labeled along with anyone else).  They certainly have their own laws, codes of moral conduct, recognizable physical characteristic, and financial authority.  It seems after muddling through these ideas that, like issues of gender, race is not a theme in Slow River in the way we have been examining it in past books.  However, the point of the van de Oest family is that they have made themselves an island, and all those apart from the island are Other, which as a concept certainly lends itself to an analogy of White Americans against the rest of the (specifically non-Western) world.&lt;/p&gt;
