 <title>Anal Play</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Point the first: eXistenZ equates its VR game with sodomy. Ted says he doesn&#039;t like to be penetrated; Allegra sexily lubes up his &quot;tight&quot; bioport before his &quot;first time&quot;; of course, when we get a look at the bioport, it looks like an asshole; then there&#039;s the really great bioport sex scene, in which Ted tongues Allegra&#039;s bioport, she responds with surprise, then arousal, then Ted, you know, fucks her in the bioport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this might be a somewhat less pressing question for the film and for the nature of VR games in general (it&#039;s in this context that we&#039;re putting eXistenZ in apposition to Snow Crash) since it&#039;s Cronenberg at the helm. Anyone who&#039;s seen Videodrome will remember the VCR-vagina that spontaneously appears in the middle of James Woods&#039;s chest, and how James Woods masturbates his VCR-vagina with a gun and then loses the gun in said orifice. It&#039;s weird and creepy and typically Cronenbergian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the stakes are somewhat different in eXistenZ. In this case, the anal nature of the bioport suffuses Ted and Allegra&#039;s discourse. For the first twenty minutes or so, any off-hand remark about Ted&#039;s gaming inexperience is also a prurient sexual remark, in which Ted is figured as the submissive (&quot;passive&quot; would typically be better, I guess, but seems less appropriate for describing the dynamics of these scenes) partner in anal sex--e.g., &quot;You&#039;ll see how natural it feels.&quot; Under other circumstances, such lines wouldn&#039;t have the same bizarre sexual charge that they do here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film has clear anxieties about the use of VR; in the final scene, Ted and Allegra accuse the game Evgeny of bastardizing reality. In a way, it makes sense that the sexual appeal of VR would be the sexual appeal of sodomy.  In Christian history, the typical reason for banning sodomy--which can include anal and oral sex, obviously--has to do not with how you do it, but why; sodomy opposes reproductive sex, which is regarded as the only good form of sex. In class, we talked a little about the seeming absurdity of wanting to accumulate Linden dollars--what&#039;s the point? is the standard take. Put value-intensively, one might say, why not do something *actually* productive? Instead, we could think of VR commerce as a sodomitical commerce. Whatever threat inheres in VR is the threat of the nonproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
