 <title>Religion is frustratingly necessary</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/358</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crake constructs a new genetically engineered human race to live more &quot;in harmony&quot; with the earth and each other by removing the human propensity for violence, meat-eating, religion, etc. etc.  Unfortunately, a lot of those are a more intrinsic to the human makeup than Crake originally guessed.  The Crakers are alone, in a world they can no  longer understand now that Crake has taken science away from them.  The only connection they have with the old world is Snowman, so naturally they go to him for answers.  Snowman becomes their guru, their demigod, who in turn raises Oryx and Crake to the status of gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake, through Snowman, provide a greater truth and reason for the Crakers than they can access with their own senses.  The three members of the old human race can answer questions for the new ones.  It is a natural, essential part of any conscious being, this need to find these answers.  I remember reading a Newsweek cover story when I was in high school â€“ which was apparently a long time ago, because I can&#039;t find the article anywhere on the Internet â€“ on the theory that the need for religion is hard-wired into our genes.  We can&#039;t help but want to believe in a greater power, though in the modern age that &quot;greater power&quot; can be science, as well as a god/dess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I suppose that the above claim is a hard one to prove, given that the only (proven) conscious beings we know about are us, and having a sample size of one is not a particularly accurate way of drawing conclusions.  However, a being that does not want to find answers to the unknowable world around it cannot possess curiosity, and a being without curiosity will not learn and will not have any new thoughts, and a being that does not think and learn can hardly be conscious.  So, as someone said in class yesterday, the only way Crake could have defeated the need for religion would have been to replace humans with a new race of monkeys.  So, conscious beings need answers. Since the Crakers do not have hard science to provide these answers for them, they have to start back where the ancients did â€“ with creation stories, fables, and myths, a primitive religion constructed around father and mother deities, Crake and Oryx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, religion comes along with a whole bundle of less savory things, as history has proven time and time again.  The Crakers will become more passionate about their deities.  As the religion becomes more and more complex, discrepancies will arise (look at how simple the original difference between the Sunnis and the Shi&#039;ites was), which will lead to argument, which because of the passion behind it will lead to hate, which will lead to war, with which comes the need to construct a hierarchy (someone has to win, which means that a whole bunch of someones will be better than a whole bunch of other someones).  And, we&#039;re back where we started, basically, except now there are a whole bunch of little herbivores running around destroying each other, and the world with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy&#039;s life pre-apocalypse serves as a way to remind us of how difficult, how impossible, it is to live without some kind of higher power to look up to.  For a child, their parents are the end-all, be-all â€“ I know when I was a kid, at least, whatever my father said was absolute truth, and anyone who said otherwise could go suck it.  (I don&#039;t think I would have phrased it in exactly that way when I was seven, however.)  Jimmy&#039;s parents are too transparently flawed for Jimmy to be able to look up to them, to be comforted in the knowledge that they are looking out for him and protecting him always.  The accounts of his early childhood are saturated with pervasive feeling of loneliness, reminding the reader of how natural that need is, and how desolate it feels to be without it.  When the childlike Crakers ask Snowman for answers, therefore, it is all the more understandable for the reader.  It&#039;s nice to feel like there&#039;s some sort of reason and plan behind all this nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS I hope that grace days count for the blog, too, because I totally used mine for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m taking my second pass on Gibson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, how awesome is watching Battlestar Galactica for class? I&#039;m definitely not going to make it through four seasons, but I&#039;m pretty hooked...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Identity and Relationships in Pattern Recognition&#039;s Online Space</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/334</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought one of the most interesting bits of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; was the way people&#039;s online friendships worked out - what with Parkaboy/Cayce and Judy/Taki eventually hooking up in the real world based on affections that were developed almost exclusively through online chatting. Obviously, this stuff says a lot about how Gibson sees the world of 2002 and the relation of technology in it to human interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cayce&#039;s dealings in cyberspace mostly take the form of posts on a publicly-available bulletin board, though she also engages in email. But the way Cayce uses that bulletin board is fundamentally different from the way Case interacts with others online in Neuromancer. That&#039;s because of the nature of the medium. Cayce, like most denizens of the modern web, can&#039;t converse face-to-face with her bulletin-board friends: she doesn&#039;t video-chat, so she can&#039;t sense people&#039;s body language, and she doesn&#039;t even have much idea who most of the people are outside of their commentary on the footage. Even though people have begun to develop communities and human relationships in cyberspace, these relationships and communities consist mostly of exchanges of text. People&#039;s identities are easily obscured, but - in &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; â€“ the relationships they form are nonetheless legitimate and meaningful, often more powerful than predominantly in-person relationships. The deep friendship between Cayce and Parkaboy is the most prevalent example, but perhaps the most intriguing such relationship is between Judy and Taki. Originally, Musashi (Darryl) and Parkaboy are just using Judy as an image to weasel information out of Taki, but when she and Taki start actually talking with each other, &quot;She&#039;s mesmerized by the extent (she says the heartbreaking purity) of Taki&#039;s passion for her&quot; and begins to think &quot;that the love Taki has to offer her is the love she&#039;s waited for all her life&quot; despite &quot;the fact that she knews Taki things she&#039;s a petite Japanese college girl, and that Darryl is translating for her both ways&quot; (232). Gibson uses the book to comment that people are increasingly text-oriented, and the inability to prejudge people in the textual realm based on their race or appearance allows new kinds of relationships to exist, such as the love between Taki and Judy that subsists â€“ at least, initially â€“ on the basis of emotion and writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, that relationship seems to ultimately work out despite the problems it faces initially, as one of the final emails applauds &quot;her enthusiasm for the city (and her boyfriend!)&quot; in Tokyo (364-365). In the world of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt;, not only is it possible to fall in love with someone just by exchanging emails, and ultimately to meet the person in real life â€“ but those relationships seem better than the relationships characters otherwise end up in â€“ as evidenced by the way Cayce ends up with Parkaboy instead of Damien, who is still muddled in a difficult relationship with the daughter of the man funding his documentary project. The happy resolutions point towards a general optimism about humans&#039; ability to adapt to such a text-based culture - maybe even a belief that such a world is better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>recognizing names</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/326</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I found interesting about Pattern Recognition--especially as it includes a world of screen names--is the use of names. Obviously we touched on Cayce in class, but only briefly. What struck me most about Cayce was that, just before she explains the pronunciation of her name, she actually tells Voytek, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; (Gibson 32). Never having actually read Moby Dick (my high school was rather terrible), I would have just been confused by this statement except that in another of my classes, we just recently read a different novel with a very similar reference. For those of you in the dark, like I was, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; is the first line in Moby Dick. What we immediately know about Ishmael--and Cayce?--is that he is a survivor of the story he is about to recount. I suppose this is encouraging as far as Cayce is concerned because her story is told in present tense, as if it is all happening *right now*. The idea that she will survive the events of the novel, whatever they may become, is nice to note. The other interesting thing about this line is that, from the way it is phrased, the reader can never know whether or not Ishmael is the narrator&#039;s real name. This certainly ties into the idea that &quot;Cayce,&quot; according to her, should actually be pronounced &quot;Casey,&quot; but she says it as &quot;Case.&quot; This, coupled with the fact that the only other Gibson I&#039;ve read featured another Case as narrator (interesting pun), adds to the ambiguity of her actual name. To go even further, it can be said that no one has any one true name, as the nature of names is that they are ambiguous: is our narrator Cayce, Cayce Pollard, or CayceP? And those are only the names we are given in the novel--we aren&#039;t told her middle name (unless I missed that somewhere), and she might have other nicknames as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Cayce is not the only name of interest in Pattern Recognition; certainly the title suggests the reader will be looking for connections and importance in all names (as well as other things). We are very briefly introduced to Parkaboy on page four, the name not really fitting with his description later on as &quot;a man with reddish, receding hair, combed straight back,&quot; who purposefully describes himself as a &quot;middle-aged white guy&quot; (337). His &quot;real&quot; name is Peter Gilbert, which does seem to fit this description better. Interestingly, however, &quot;Parkaboy&quot; appears very fitting to his online personality, the way he writes in emails and forums--kind of silly but with a solid intelligence behind it. It makes me want to think of the physical person as Peter Gilbert and of the personality as Parkaboy; yet of course, they are one and the same. It does show, however, that if we were left to pick our own names, we might pick names that more accurately fit who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is Hubertus Bigend, who seems to fit his name in some perfect way: &quot;a nominal Belgian who looks like Tom Cruise on a diet of virgins&#039; blood and truffled chocolates&quot; (7). His girth apparently fits his name, though he either does not see the humorous connection or (more likely, given pattern recognition) he refuses to acknowledge it. Cayce also knows Bigend as a &quot;Lombard,&quot; &quot;which Cayce had at first thought might be a reference somehow to his Belgian-ness, until learning, upon finally asking, that it was Margot&#039;s acronym for &#039;Loads of money but a real dickhead&#039; &quot; (57). In this case, of course, the name is quite applicable, and once again goes to show that names made up later in life better portray the person than names given at birth (though Bigend&#039;s name comes close to this). This does point out the problem with trying to give associations to people&#039;s names in novels--for a character&#039;s name to mean something about him or her, it actually must be a name that would not be theirs in reality. What I mean is, in the real world, names don&#039;t usually say something about a person&#039;s character, the way they often do in a novel. Thus, the more &quot;realistic&quot; a novel is, the less the names will mean. How disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition: An Outsider&#039;s Viewpoint</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/320</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world of billboards and ad spots, and more to the point, a world of product placement, growing ever more subtle, as demonstrated by Trans in Pattern Recognition, it seems that there&#039;s no way to understand Western culture without being so thoroughly exposed to advertising that corporate mores don&#039;t draw one in to a world where one is an object of the market.  Who then, has the ability to objectively observe markets in action without abstracting them to the degree of economics?  My answer, obviously, is that Cayce, with her absurd sensitivity to trademarks, logos, and anything chic, is the ultimate outsider amidst the commercial world she physically inhabits.  She has the equivalent of a sixth sense, which allows, yea, motivates her to note and avoid that which is intended to implicitly draw her into consumerism.&lt;br /&gt;
	Yet, even with an effectively superhuman ability to avoid marketing, Cayce has to go through an amazing amount of work to maintain her position on the outside.  Her clothes, no doubt difficult to acquire, giving her specifications, must be trimmed and filed carefully (and sometimes confusedly), until they gain the status of CPUs.  Her home, as we hear of it secondhand, is nearly ascetic.  It&#039;s difficult to obtain creature comforts without the logos that mark them as luxurious.  And her outsider status marks her as an outsider.  Her anti-fashion statement may appear indie, but doesn&#039;t blend into any particular culture, and would probably impede any effort she made to gain status in any particular sphere.  It seems that her separation from any one structure, any culture, makes power irrelevant to her world.  She certainly responds negatively, or at best, ambivalently, to any situations where any power differential is imposed on her.&lt;br /&gt;
	Perhaps as an outcome of her separation from the world around her, Cayce can see patterns in the mobs around her.  Her ability to spot emerging trends goes beyond her benevolent pathology to a type of pattern recognition that, while related to her allergy, is consciously cultivated, and at which she also clearly excels.  My question is, then, what would it take for any member of Pattern Recognition&#039;s audience to stand far enough above the fray to note the patterns as Cayce does?  Or is that only a divine perspective now?&lt;/p&gt;
