 <title>Gethenians and Bugs</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I had been pondering in class, but didn&#039;t really get around to talking about was a comparison between the Bugs of Starship Troopers and the Gethenians.  I was considering how we responded very differently, as did the protagonists, to the bugs and the Gethenians and what some of the factors are that go into that.  In class we were describing the Gethenians as so very different from us, but at the same time, according to Le Guin&#039;s constructed biological family tree both the people of Terran and the people of Gethen were descended from the same people of Hain, and Genly can &quot;pass&quot; as being a native of the planet, if a slightly strange one.  (That also brings up the idea of &quot;passing,&quot; which is an incredibly loaded discussion both in considering race and gender/sexuality, but I don&#039;t have the stamina or inclination to go there right now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bugs had a similarly binary sexuality, even though separated by caste, so there were the drones and warriors - who we assume are male - and then the queen, obviously female.  Perhaps it is that the Bugs were so much like insects that we barely compared them to ourselves, but it struck me as strange that we mentioned how different the Gethenians were when Estraven states that from a visible standpoint, and even in some cultural aspects, they&#039;re extremely similar, it&#039;s the inner biology that so very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if this makes sense to anyone else, but it stuck out as a thought during discussion today that we seemed more comfortable with the idea of an insect race of aliens with identifiable and stable genders that we can clearly categorize and compare to something familiar.  And we seemed highly uncomfortable with the idea of this fluctuating gender and the accompanying foreign changes that result from it in society, even though solely by physical appearance the Gethenians should have been so much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d be happy to hear any thoughts, as mine aren&#039;t really formed into a single cohesive argument at all.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/53</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, this novel seems to extol the virtue of the military.  All of the characters who we are supposed to respect do at some point come to the conclusion that all real men are military men, that it makes sense that one can only be a citizen after completing a term of service.  Dubois believes this from the beginning.  He drills the idea of the importance of civic duty, and of violence into his students during History and Moral Philosophy: &quot;breeds that forget this basic truth [that violence settles most anything] have always paid for it with their lives and freedom&quot; (27). Even Rico&#039;s father, initially the most vocal anti-military character in the book comes to the realization that before the war he had been simply a &quot;producing-consuming economic animalâ€¦&quot; but, by joining the army, he was going to become a man (180).  The M.I. are portrayed as the best military outfit the world&#039;s ever seen: impeccably trained, highly efficient, and passionate.  Such traits are admirable in any context, one doesn&#039;t need to approve of military training to be impressed by their performance.  As an opponent of war, I am not typically moved by romanticized portrayals of military life.  But I was impressed by Rico&#039;s description of life as a member of Rasczak&#039;s Roughnecks.  He says, &quot;they didn&#039;t wear [the skulls] because, in Rasczack&#039;s Roughnecks, it didn&#039;t matter in the least how many combat drops you had made, nor which ones; you were either a Roughneck or you weren&#039;t--and if you were not, they didn&#039;t care who you were&quot; (147).  The fraternity he describes in the passage actually appealed to me (though it is noteworthy that this is a fraternity in a fairly literal sense: no women allowed).  That even I can be made to respect, and even approve of, this army certainly seems to imply that this book glorifies of the ideals of a military class.  However, there are ways that Rico acts which suggest that the military is not as glamorous as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico mentions on multiple occasions how proud he is to be a part of the Mobile Infantry.  &quot;We&#039;re all volunteers;&quot; he says, &quot;we&#039;re M.I. because we want to be, we&#039;re proud to be M.I. and the M.I. is proud of us.  If a man doesn&#039;t feel that way about it, from his callused feet to his hairy ears, I don&#039;t want him on my flank when trouble starts&quot; (115).  Though this is all fine and well, Rico seems to have forgotten that he&#039;s not M.I. because he wanted to be.  He didn&#039;t even make the conscious choice to enlist at all.  When he tells Carmen he&#039;s going to enlist he admits: &quot;I hadn&#039;t made any decision; my mouth was leading its own life&quot; (29).  But even once enlisted, M.I. wasn&#039;t his first choice, it was his last.  He&#039;s only an M.I. because he flunked the test for every other military position.  I found the fact that he ignores his real motives for joining the M.I. (desire to impress a girl, an inability to perform any other function), or perhaps has forgotten them completely, slightly disconcerting.  Similarly strange is when he &quot;goes career&quot; on a whim, giving it about as much thought as he did his decision to enlist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found more shocking was just how desensitized to violence Rico becomes as the novel progresses.  He describes the difficulties involved in training in the Rockies, how tricky it is to navigate mountains in the powered suits, and to drive the point home he explains &quot;we had three major casualties in suit practice in broken country, two dead and one medical retirement&quot; (129).  And then he moves on, describes climbing the mountains without a suit.  There&#039;s no emotion attached to these deaths, they&#039;re just numbers.  Again, at the end of training: &quot;we graduated 187--of the others, fourteen were dead (one executed and his name struck) and the rest resigned&quot; (136).  These deaths are statistics, nothing else.  At one point, he divides attrition into two categories, casualties and &quot;refusal to enter capsule,&quot; all lumped together, equally remarkable (135).  The fact that some people refused to drop is actually discussed more.  And it&#039;s not the case that Rico was always insensitive to violence, he fainted at the beginning of training, partway through a flogging of a fellow officer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you can argue that Rico&#039;s split second decision to join the military, and then to devote his life to the service goes to show that in his heart he knew it was the right thing to do; as he learned in History and Moral Philosophy, civic duty simply is the epitome of responsibility.  Furthermore his conversion to the cult of the M.I. possibly evidences that the M.I. really are just an incredible group of individuals.  And his ability to stay cool in the face of death is perhaps simply proof of the competence of the M.I.  But to my mind, it&#039;s hard not to see these as evidence that the military is not all good, as the medical man implies as he examines Rico, service changes men for the worse.  Though clearly it would be difficult to argue that Starship Troopers is actually advocating the dissolution of the military, does the novel actually portray armed forces as perhaps less than ideal?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Some thoughts on Neuromancer, more.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/50</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It took about two-three chapters, but I realized that I had already read Neuromancer before.  I finished the book, and I enjoyed it.  Both the first and second readings were enjoyable.  But one of the things most enjoyable to me was just like in Starship Troopers, and a number of other great Sci-Fi books, things happen behind the novel that prop it up.  Never is it said explicitly in the novel that there was a World War, or some kind of culmination of the cold war.  I inferred that from the Screaming Fist incident with Corto that at least some sort of conflict occurred.  Clearly the world is a much different place than otherwise it should be.  This kind of thing makes me enjoy a novel more, because I can imagine a sequence of events that could lead to the events of the novel.  The extension of BosWash into BAMA, the sprawl, isn&#039;t even that hard to imagine, and does seem to be the way the megalopolis is headed.  Lax laws in space could lead to something along the lines of Freeside, where laws can be taken on by the owners rather than some sort of governmental entity.  This is sort of a segue, but it also reminded me of The Postman.  The Postman is one of my favorite books of all time, and also used allusion to great advantage.  Never does on find out what exactly happened to cause the post-apocalyptic world that the protagonist finds himself in, or what the rest of the world looks like.  For all the reader knows, it could be flourishing.  But it doesn&#039;t make that large of difference because the story does not involve anything out.  Both, or even all three stories, decide to focus on one person and leave out a lot of information that would be informative, but not necessary to the story.  It lets the reader fill in the holes.  That is my favorite kind of book.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response to Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/45</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Response To Heinlein&#039;s Starship Troopers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always like Sci-Fi.  I don&#039;t know why I did originally, it was just something my mother got out of the library, and I would read it, having no other choice of something to read.  As I got older though, I grew pickier about my sci-fi.  I grew away from Space Westerns, and started liking more &quot;speculative fiction.&quot;  Of course that didn&#039;t mean that I didn&#039;t still enjoy Space Westerns, just that I thought of them more as fluff.  That&#039;s why I enjoy Starship Troopers so much.  Not only is it such a good piece of speculative fiction, specifically with its all volunteer army, power suits, and a voting populace completely consisting of veterans, but it also has a number of scenes that make my inner fan boy squeal with delight.  The first scene about destroying property on the Skinny planet makes for a great read about a &quot;bad ass marine.&quot;  More importantly to our class, was the scene at the end of the Skinny planet on pages 17-20.  While the mobile infantry are taking care of their own, up in the sky, a woman pilot makes extremely difficult computations on the fly and manages to save their retrieval boat, even though it launched late.&lt;br /&gt;
	Situations like this show Heinlein&#039;s respect for women in the context of a world that draws on the 1950s.  Women make the best pilots, Heinlein says.  They have better reflexes and are able to make the snap decisions that lead to becoming good pilots.  Women have a very important role in the novel.  The Mobile Infantry would be nothing without the ships that brought them to their combats, and this is alluded to throughout the novel.  The navy, and the women, are working constantly on the ship, bringing Mobile Infantry men to their battles, where they fight for only the slightest amount of time, at least in comparison with the amount of time they spend on the ship.  There is the argument that the women pilots do not fight, which is essential in a male dominated society to gain respect, but every scene with a female captain involves the mobile infantry paying her the utmost respect.  The Navy also seems to do more than the Army.  While it almost falls under the radar, the story tells about how the Navy takes out far more bugs than the Army with their planet smashing guns.  In fact, the Mobile Infantry seems almost redundant with the weaponry that Heinlein says the Navy has.  The ability to rip a planet into pieces is far more powerful than the specialized surgical strikes that the men of the Mobile Infantry have.  Also, the job is almost as dangerous for the women pilots, as seen when two ships crash and kill all women Navy crew members.  So in conclusion, even though women can be seen as &quot;bus drivers&quot;, which is a relic of the 1950s time period, they are exalted bus drivers, ones that command most of the power.  In his own way, Heinlein gives women more power to women than men.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The difference between an MI man and a bug is...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/44</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m tempted to call this novel nostalgic, for all of its debatable purpose and philosophy.  Of course I wouldn&#039;t be the first to call it so, and part of the reason the jacket calls it &quot;The controversial classic of military adventure&quot; is the long history it has spawned of civilian readers being to some degree upset or suspicious of the almost fond way in which this future society of citizenship through military service is described; but still I had promised myself going in that I was going to try and find Heinlein&#039;s real philosophy behind the novel.  As it turns out, I&#039;m really feeling a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality from the book.  Is that surprising?  I think that even though you have characters like Mr. Dubois espousing the nature of the beauty of war and the enforcing of a moral system through punishment, sometimes Heinlein seems to be bringing out the very humanity he seems to find in such a system.  The first time I really felt this was in the passage, starting on page 80, that describes Rico&#039;s experience overhearing Zim and Frankel discussing their strong feelings of anguish at the punishment they had just ordered for Hendrick, and in the process describing the very reasons they had been forced, out of an absolute loyalty to the system, to act against these feelings.  Rico&#039;s response is his &quot;unsettling feeling that I had been completely mistaken as to the nature of the world I was in.&quot;  This isn&#039;t a passage the describes an undermining of the system, but rather a moment in which the main character experiences a epiphany about the significance and the actual (supposed?) underlying morality behind the value of adherence to a strict system for the good of the whole. Certainly Heinlein&#039;s career in the military (thanks Wikipedia) couldn&#039;t help but have informed this book, and certainly this is something that&#039;s been held against him by some critics.  As a civilian, though, I&#039;m as wary as the rest of you about such a rigid system like the one described by Heinlein (despite the humanity exhibited in private by some characters) in real life practice, and this book (though dated) certainly seems to try and nestle itself closely to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One classmate mentioned something about the tendency of Greek plays to include a character whose only purpose in the play was to expound to the audience about the philosophy the writer has attempted to embody in the play and his reasons for writing it to begin with.  Interesting to see that method popping up again here, in the form of mister (colonel) Dubois.  He doesn&#039;t just have one passage in which he seems to be lecturing not only Rico but the reader, but one of the most memorable surrounds page 118, at which point he begins to discuss mankind&#039;s cultivated &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals.&quot;  This is apparently the theory on which the entire society has been based, a society in which Citizenship (which means more than just suffrage) is awarded to those who voluntarily perform military service, and in which the MI are the most deserving, the most understanding of the morality they are upholding and the honor which they claim because of it.  Everyone, the recruiter, Dubois, Rico, Zim, Ace is proud of the MI legacy and seems to belong to a club of understanding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet there are the bugs.  They are unafraid of defending themselves, they are willing to sacrifice all in the name of the whole.  In many ways they embody the &quot;noblest fate&quot; described by Dubois, throwing themselves relentlessly into war and in front of their home.  And yet humanity, for all its rigid belief of sacrifice for the whole, does not recognize this. Sure, they&#039;re bugs, but if they were evaluated by the same system as the soldiers evaluate themselves, wouldn&#039;t their be something that would have to be said for bug morality and bug civilization?  Dubois mentions in passing that humanity is &quot;even developing an exact method for extra-human relations.&quot; (118)  Because humanity&#039;s method for inter-human relations is restricted to humans.  Yes, here I can see it: the potential for problematic reading of Heinlein&#039;s universe as one in which different systems of evaluation for different beings goes unquestioned.  How different to the beings have to be before they lose a place in the human system?  The &quot;Skinnies&quot; aren&#039;t anything like the bugs.  And yet humanity has put them in the same moral place: far away from itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>observations on the status of women</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/42</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I ended up coming to this text from a general feminist perspective, since the dominant voices in the story are obviously male, and women are only seen in scattered instances, both inside and outside the military system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Heinlein doesn&#039;t seem to hold the view on women that I expected him to express, which was of the &quot;all women are objects, good for nothing but cooking, cleaning and sex&quot; variety. Well, at least he doesn&#039;t hold it to an absolute extreme. Starship Troopers was first published in 1959, just before the sexual (and political) revolution of the 1960s; the ideal feminine image was likely still that of the happy homemaker.&lt;br /&gt;
There are some scenes that do support this misogynistic view of women. For example, on page 27, Johnnie and his friend Carl run into another friend of theirs, Carmencita Ibanez, on the way to the military recruiters&#039; office. She announces that she is signing up to become a pilot, and Johnnie remarks to himself: &quot;Fact was, little Carmen was so ornamental that you just never thought about her being useful.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are also treated as a form of visual entertainment, as Johnnie describes on pages 125-126: &quot;I stood around and gawked...at girls. I hadn&#039;t realized how wonderful they were. Look, I&#039;d approved of girls from the time I&#039;d first noticed that the difference was more than that they dressed differently.&quot; Oh, okay; so as soon as the girls became sexually fascinating it was easier to &#039;approve&#039; of them? Do they need that &#039;approval&#039; in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Military women seem to be a partial exception to this view. It is acknowledged in several instances that women make the sharpest and most creative pilots, such as Captain Deladrier, who is clearly in a position of some authority over the men on her ship. She is ultimately responsible for the success of their missions at the beginning and the end. When Johnnie notices that Carmen has shaved her head for the Navy, he expresses a deeper respect for her: &quot;It does serve to set a Navy girl apart from civilian chicks; sort of a lodge pin, like the gold skulls for combat drops. It made Carmen look distinguished, gave her dignity, and for the first time I finally realized that she was an officer and a fighting man---as well as a very pretty girl.&quot; Of course, this also implies that the only way that women can obtain some dignity is through military service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is something I wanted to open up to discussion. Are the views of women expressed in this book predictable and in line with the military perspective? Does Heinlein seem to be emphasizing the inferiority of women? or merely subjugating all his characters to the mighty military machine that he praises so much? Etc?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Individualizing Civilians within the Federation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/40</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While the bugs are all kinds of huge in the movie, I was surprised at how little they actually figured in the book.  The entire book I kept waiting for the epic bug fights, as my previous introduction to the story had been through the second half of the movie.  A third of the way through the book, Rico gets out of boot camp.  The bugs aren&#039;t even mentioned until the halfway point.  For all that there is commentary about the evil commie hive-mind bugs, I found that they had virtually no importance in the novel.  The book never truly ends, and the bug war certainly doesn&#039;t.  Rico has had time to make it to Lieutenant, and it&#039;s still the same war against the same enemy with heated combat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federation strikes me much more as a war industry than a political force.  It doesn&#039;t matter who the enemy is, it just matters that there is an enemy, and that it is very different from humanity.  At this point, there is an implication that the entire world and its numerous extra-planetary colonies are all under one government, one nation.  Yet throughout the text, you have these small moments of the acknowledgement that earthly nationalities still exist, almost subversively.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rico&#039;s father rails against Rico joining the Federal Service, his comment of Mr. Dubois is &quot;Hmmph, a silly name--it suits him.  Foreigner, no doubt&quot; (23).  Throughout the text, there is the implication that there is but one government, one nation, under the Federation, and one official language, English.  How there can be a foreigner, then, if this is truly the system, is quite the puzzlement.  Given that the military is the one that clumped the entire world together, and has since maintained order with an iron fist, it seems logical that civilians have not had the sense of home and tradition and personal heritage taken away from them because they still have an individuality that implies a personal history.  This individuality is stripped away from those who enter service with the Federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Service, though, has some sense of national heritage, as is seen with the band that plays on marches.  Rico always talks about the origin of the music when he talks about the band, be it the Scottish bagpipes that somehow grew on him, or French revolutionary nationalistic songs like Marseilles (94).*  There are also many ethnically specific, or at least evocative, names throughout the text, which creates a small attempt by civilians to maintain personal pride and heritage.  Juan becomes Johnnie, though, showing how the military environment, with its Standard English, further seeks to strip away personal identifiers and pride in and loyalty to something other than the Federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a strong sense of a division between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres throughout the book.  At boot camp, Zim adopts a completely different persona when fighting Shujumi.  There is a strange highlight on the art of the martial art, with a step away from the martial.  Attaching on to this, Heinlein creates a history, written during the Cold War, in which the &quot;Russo-Anglo-American Alliance and the Chinese Hegemony&quot; (113) are the two sides in the final war before all the world&#039;s government and law-enforcement systems break down, sometime in the late XXth century.**  What I found most striking here was that Heinlein rearranged the alliances of the Cold War, putting bitter enemies together, mixing communism and democracy.  Perhaps Heinlein was attempting to subtlety underscore his belief that neither system worked well enough.  What struck me most about this, though, was the construct of the East versus the West.  While both sides fall to shambles, the West ultimately wins, in that it is in Scotland that the Federation first begins to form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know exactly what Heinlein is trying to do with this.  The best I can come to making sense of this is through the scene with martial arts.  Yes, Rico mentions later that Shujumi serves as the group&#039;s martial arts instructor, but there is never again a point when it is explicitly used.  Zim learned from Shujumi&#039;s father, whom Shujumi also trained under.  Zim wins the fight.  Is the message, then, that only when you have consumed all the cultures around you, form their fighting styles to their music, can you truly &quot;win&quot; at anything?  The Federation maintains power by being the only governing body in the world, quite literally.  To do so, they have had to consume all of the world&#039;s cultures.  Is, then, part of the failure in the war against the bugs a result of their inability to learn from the bugs?  Rico mentions that the brain bugs, though captured, prove to be of little use, as they die so quickly after capture.  Or is this lack of understanding of the bugs, the inability to communicate or compromise, and the resulting war necessary for the continuation of the Federation, and thus in some way propagated by the Federation?  I&#039;m not suggesting some crazy paranoid conspiracy plan, but what I am suggesting is that Heinlein&#039;s stance in this book is that war is a human necessity, and that the lesser of the evils, that which is better for the group, is to fight against that which you cannot understand, rather than fight amongst those who you choose not to understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Interesting tidbit!  Apparently banned at various points in French history and has words like citizen running amok in it.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Perhaps XX instead of 20 is meant to indicate that we are so far in the future that Arabic numeral fail us, we need the oh-so-classy, complex Roman numerals for that might that is the World?  Or maybe it&#039;s meant to harken back to the Roman Empire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Completely unrelated, but stuff I thought was fascinating: the bugs in the text are never given much size definition, but the queens are thought to be the size of large horses, which seems inconceivable to Rico, so presumably they&#039;re meant to be rather smaller than those awesome goo-filled guys in the movie.  This seems important, but I haven&#039;t fully sorted out for myself just why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****Other thought--Rico refers to Zim as an &quot;invincible robot&quot; (85), the MIs are forever being called apes, and &quot;[Sergeants] don&#039;t have mothers. [â€¦]  They reproduce by fissionâ€¦like all bacteria&quot; (50).  These MIs sure spend a lot of time not being human, then don exoskeletons to go fight intelligent bugsâ€¦   Something&#039;s up hereâ€¦  Alas, it is also 2am.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Truth, science and religion in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/39</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m a bit science and religion obsessed academically, but I think the discussion here could be fruitful. This really goes back to the class discussion about the &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals&quot; (p. 118). I think Riceguy20 is totally right to highlight  the quote &quot;Man has no moral instinct&quot; (p. 117) as really important -- through the instrument of Mr. Dubois, Heinlein constructs the ultimate &#039;science trumps religion&#039; universe. My interest derives also from Asimov&#039;s &quot;Foundation&quot;, in which a branch of mathematics called &quot;psychohistory&quot; develops that governs nearly every part of life (to certain scale/degree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present-day world, writers like Edward Wilson might suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
biological basis for morality&lt;/a&gt;, but even so we&#039;re still one step shy of explaining all subjects with symbolic logic. Repeatedly, such logic is the ultimate appeal in Starship Troopers. Assignments like &quot;Bring to class a written proof, in symbolic logic&quot; (p. 179) often follow many enormously important discussions in History and Moral Philosophy. This type of proof (or even just the suggestion that such a proof exists) seems to apparently putting the matter to rest; regardless of its controversial, political, and subjective nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this strike anyone else as a perversion of the humanities? Not everything  can be an &quot;exact science&quot; (p. 182) with one right answer. I cherish needing different models (yeah, there&#039;s some truth in looking at morals as deriving purely from nature and nurture; but I also find much meaning from considering some transcendental role), so it frustrates me that Starship Troopers describes a &#039;one right, proovable, answer&#039; world. Interestingly, your answers in such a universe are still going to depend on your initial assumptions... you can&#039;t prove everything. The biggest assumption made, that science works and teaches them Truth about the real world, can be neither proved or disproved, only debated and assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might science fiction like ST or Foundation disregard any need for non-scientific truth? Yes, the intended audience might be more familiar with science as authority, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s all there is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Perhaps the film isn&#039;t totally ridiculous...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/38</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Heinlein is not overly concerned with subtlety.  Perhaps fearful of some particularly dense reader missing his unmitigated support of the military, big government and capital punishment, Heinlein places only the thinnest of sci-fi veils over his long-winded political monologues.  This does not make it a bad read â€“ the plot is still compelling â€“ but when I reach the scenes of History and Moral Philosophy classes, I do want to throw something at him, as roseblack says.  This future world in which Johnny Rico operates has indeed been radically altered.  The military has risen in power and influence, technological advances are responsible for major military and social changes, and the increased globalization of Terra has resulted in cultural assimilation.  The film version, while truly atrocious when taken seriously, takes on a new and deeper meaning when read as an oppositional text.&lt;br /&gt;
As Heinlein portrays it, Rico&#039;s society is near perfect, or at least a great improvement on our own.  The new style of democracy &quot;insure[s] that all who wield it [the vote] accept the ultimate in social responsibilityâ€¦to wager his own lifeâ€¦to save the life of the state&quot; (184).  The Federation of the film, however, has definite fascist tendencies; they control voting rights, reproductive rights, and the media.  Significant segments are viewed through the Federation&#039;s media channel, heavily laden with World War II style propaganda and an almost sadistic celebration of executions and gore.  An authoritative male voice narrates, and in one advertisement asks &quot;Want to know more?&quot; over the sound of a crowd cheering at a death sentence.  They seem more to be hallmarks of a dystopia than a perfected society.&lt;br /&gt;
The main character, Juan Rico, is renamed John Rico in the film, the actor&#039;s blonde hair and blue eyes stereotypically Anglo.  It underlines the loss of ethnic and cultural diversity in Starship Troopers, something that Heinlein glosses over or even celebrates in his writing. In the book, Rico is from Buenos Aires but is still an English speaker.  He is part of the social elite, one of the richest of his peers, part of the hegemonic order that clearly adheres to a Western patriarchal society&#039;s ideals.  Globalization has destroyed all other culture&#039;s values.  The film highlights this in its transformation of Rico, indicating his adherence to our social order.  Further underlining this Western hegemony is the only Hispanic in the movie, a fellow member of boot camp who admits he is only in the military because his family does not have enough money to send him to Harvard, placing him in the same lower classes than the current stereotyped image of Hispanics today.  Religion, pretty much the most powerful divider throughout human history, has only the slightest presence in the book, meriting only a passing mention in the beginning that the same Catholic priest is sufficient for &quot;Moslems, Christians, Gnostics, Jewsâ€¦&quot;(4).  Even religion does not really matter anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
A final stake to the heart of the book is in the film&#039;s battle scenes.  Heinlein&#039;s military is at its peak of efficiency and power.  The M.I. are superhuman, well-trained killing machines.  In appearance, the film&#039;s soldiers are barely different from today&#039;s; the only improvement seems to be the increased presence of nuclear weapons, which are more just big bombs than the ultimate in death and destruction.  Soldiers run in disorderly swarms across the screen, firing indiscriminately, and poorly, in the general direction of the Bugs before beating a hasty, and often cowardly, retreat.  They come across as badly trained and just plain unequipped to deal with a threat, rather than the book&#039;s depiction of a dominant fighting force that has finally met its match in the Bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&lt;Insert witty title for my response here&gt;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/35</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In our Monday class, we touched on Heinlein&#039;s use of the History and Moral Philosophy teachers as voices of political commentary and social criticism.  As clumsy or obvious as that may have seemed, his choice to do this very much ties into the idea of Science Fiction as an unappreciated genre for commenting on society and our own culture by using distance, alien cultures and/or the passage of time to reflect from a simulated outside perspective.  The Freedman article definitely seemed like a stretch in some places, but both that and the Suvin were trying to highlight the place of Science Fiction in modern life and relate it to reality.  Much of the Sci-Fi that is readily available in the consumer market can be appreciated solely for its entertainment value and dismissed when one tries to wedge it into any kind of greater moral philosophy â€“ what comes to mind most readily being many of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books such as the Rogue Squadron series.  Interestingly, the original Star Wars movies are full of philosophy and commentary on the disconnection and contamination of the human mind.  Yoda comes up frequently in many non-Sci-Fi related theoretical discussions, at least in the mind of this nerd, because of some unexpectedly wise statements.  One that came to mind recently in a discussion of the body/mind conundrum was &quot;luminous beings are weâ€¦not this crude matter.&quot;  However, it seems that Science Fiction is often considered to be an entertainment genre and not worthy of greater study or dissection in order to assess a potentially richer commentary on our present society.  Certainly there are exceptions, for example, George Orwell&#039;s 1984 definitely can fit into the Sci-Fi category and is required reading for every school child.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, trying to return to a focus on Heinlein and his work, it was surprising, especially after watching the film as well, to consider the ideas of sexism.  While not considering myself an overly sensitive person, six semesters at Scripps teaches one to be aware of potential points of controversy from a feminist perspective.  Yet there seemed nothing overly offensive to women, nor anything to suggest that women had a limited place in Heinlein&#039;s concept of the future.  Heinlein, contrary to the movie version, does not include women in the M.I., but does not exclude them from the military in other areas, as was the case for all but nurses at the time he wrote the book.  At first his decision to have the women pilots shave their heads was confusing, but once explained it made perfect sense and highlighted some of the more ludicrous details of the film that separated from Heinlein&#039;s vision.  He also commented several times on the importance of women for morale purposes, simply their presence on ships boosted the interest of the men in fighting that much harder.  Knowing of his previous experience as a veteran himself, this was undoubtedly from deeply felt emotions of his own during that time and not intended to objectify or belittle women.  Perhaps it shows the absolute opposite, to elevate women and illuminate them as of great importance to society, the protection of the species and Man&#039;s necessity for a counterpart.  The concept of partnership was absent from the social hierarchy of the bugs, with the workers and soldiers being expendable and easily replaceable pawns for the Queen, or Queens, to dispose of as she saw fit.  The contrast of these two systems of procreation and gender roles served to point out the importance of Man&#039;s humanity, the value of the individual and the undying devotion to preserving the good parts of our society.  As a final side note, had the bugs had more &quot;human&quot; methods of relating to one another and perhaps possessed the ability to love, they would have been a much harder target to demonize and annihilate in the way that they were.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Signifying Absences: Amputation in Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/34</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(By way of a response) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The hand he had offered me was the one that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several amputees are featured prominently in Starship Troopers. This is not exactly surprising; the dangerous combat and training to which &quot;cap troopers&quot; are subjected result in frequent death and maiming. The specific mention of people&#039;s amputated limbs serves a couple different purposes that are immediately distinguishable: on the one hand (pun regrettably intended), there is the Fleet Sergeant Ho model, in which the amputated limb is a warning, a &quot;horror show&quot; (39); on the other hand, there is the Dubois model, in which a nonlimb is displayed prominently as a badge or marker denoting experience, sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is careful not to lay out these two alternate significances too schematically. Chronologically, the first amputee whom Johnnie encounters is Mr. Dubois, the History and Moral Philosophy teacher. Of Mr. Dubois Johnny recalls: &quot;He would just point at you with the stump of his left armâ€¦&quot; (25). Clearly, Mr. Dubois cannot fall under the &quot;horror show&quot; category--although Johnnie does claim that Mr. Dubois &quot;discourages&quot; his students from serving (23). However, it is somewhat misleading to say that Mr. Dubois is the paradigmatic example of the missing-limb-as-ultimate-badge-of-honor character, if only because Johnnie does not immediately recognize what, exactly, Mr. Dubois&#039;s missing limb means--that is, Johnnie does not know until much later exactly how much experience Dubois had, how much he sacrificed. When Johnnie is in boot camp, he receives a letter from Dubois, the signature of which bears a surprisingly high rank: &quot;We supposed (if we thought about it at all) that he must have been a corporal or some such who had been let out when he lost his hand and had been fixed up with a soft job teaching a course that didn&#039;t have to be passedâ€¦&quot; (91). Dubois&#039;s rank--Lieutenant Colonel--raises his status in Johnnie&#039;s eyes, such that Dubois&#039;s having taken a job teaching high school suddenly seems to him sort of heroic, rather than an easy retirement option; such that Dubois&#039;s amputated limb becomes not a mere ticket to a &quot;soft job&quot; but a distinguishing sign of &quot;honor.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading of characters&#039; phantom limbs is more immediately accessible both to Johnnie--and, by proxy, to the reader--when Johnnie reaches officers&#039; training: &quot;Most of the instructors, especially the officers, were disabled. The only ones I can remember who had a full complement of arms, legs, eyesight, hearing, etc., were some of the non-commissioned combat instructors--and not all of those&quot; (174). Johnnie&#039;s thinking at this point parallels neatly with the thoughts of his high-school self: &quot;At first I wondered why those obvious candidates for physical retirement and full-pay pension didn&#039;t take it and go home. Then I quit wondering&quot; (174). At first blush, &quot;Then I quit wondering&quot; sounds sort of like &quot;if we thought about it at all.&quot; However, in the later case, Johnnie recognizes in his instructors&#039; actions the &quot;virtuous&quot; tautology of military service; MI fight because they are MI, we are repeatedly reminded; so, too, Johnnie concludes, it can be said only that his instructors did not retire because they are not retirees. Point being, Johnnie stops thinking about their reasoning not because he doesn&#039;t care but because he recognizes the valor that inheres in these men&#039;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in the second model is the violence of war--the fact that necessitates or realizes amputation--actually implied. The second model is peculiar, too, because singular and short-lived: Fleet Sergeant Ho is the only given example of the Fleet Sergeant Ho model: &quot;A fleet sergeant sat at a desk there, in dress uniform, gaudy as a circus. His chest was loaded with ribbons I couldn&#039;t read. But his right arm was off so short that his tunic had been tailored without any sleeve at allâ€¦and, when you came up to the rail, you could see that he had no legs&quot; (28). Although Johnnie says that &quot;it doesn&#039;t seem to bother&quot; Ho very much, it does make an impression on Johnnie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days later, Johnnie meets the same man outside the recruiting station, walking and gesturing with a full set of prostheses: &quot;I don&#039;t have to put on my horror show after working hours,&quot; he explains to Johnnie (39). Here, the second model collapses into the first; Ho congratulates Johnnie on joining the MI, shakes hands with him using a prosthetic limb, and Johnnie, only briefly &quot;horrified,&quot; never looks back.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Starship Troopers Critical Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/33</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering the points that the class made on Monday concerning the definition of Science Fiction, the way this novel presents the present psychology of chastisement and punishment outlined in the lecture given by Mr. Dubois to the History and Moral Philosophy class was very interesting. (pg 112-120)  Starting with an effective analogy given to Juan about the training of puppies and ending with an explanation as to why a nation based on &quot;pseudo-psychological nonsense&quot; and a &quot;glorifiedâ€¦mythology of rights&quot; cannot endure, he logically explains how such a society, our society, cannot be stable.&lt;br /&gt;
	The beginning analogy of the housebreaking of puppies is very effective in giving a rough example of what should be done to perpetrators of crimes.  After the act, the animal is scolded, his or her nose is rubbed in the &#039;accident,&#039; and then he is swatted.  This is contrasted to the gang action that was apparently very common in the earlier stages of the novel&#039;s history (and in our world today.)  He asserts that by not giving them the proper upbringing as children, more specifically by not including pain in the punishment of crimes, the basic learning instincts of humanity was not utilized, and thus no lesson was learned.  So, on subsequent crimes, when the maximum crime was inflicted, it would be similar to never swatting a puppy, then shooting it after it&#039;s still are not housebroken as a full grown dog.&lt;br /&gt;
	A girl I the class comments on this, saying how she doesn&#039;t mind being swatted once in a while when compared to not being able to be outside at night.  This added point of view, the opposite of the modern idea, is a clever device.  Her ending comment, &quot;Why--that&#039;s horrible!&quot;, is a very human approach towards a seemingly inhumane way of thinking.  That is, that of increased, violent punishment as opposed to psychological therapy and understanding.  The idea is that the wrong way of thinking, our modern way, is &quot;half fuzzy-headed wishful thinking, half rationalized charlatanry.&quot;  Dubois asserts that, &quot;Man has no moral instinct.&quot;  This is an extremely nihilistic statement, proposing that not only is man no more than a highly trained animal, but also has no overarching moral sense, like that bestowed by divinity.  After this he goes on to propose that there is no morality, just an elaboration of the instinct to survive.  This is what brings him to the crux of his argument, which are the imperatives of survival that surpass that of the individual, and the loss of this in the old society.&lt;br /&gt;
	This includes the survival of family, children, and higher.  In the novel culture especially, the importance of the nation, planet, and even species are placed in higher regard.  By examining the problem faced by the individual in why one feels the need to place one&#039;s wellbeing on the line, one can tell how far up the moral ladder one can go.  Whether one is capable of giving one&#039;s life for a cause as lofty and obscure as &#039;the good of mankind.&#039;  The street gang members only reached the level of simple gang obedience; the never were taught or learned to look any higher.  Thus, any attempt to appeal to their morality or better natures is completely useless since there is nothing to appeal to.  They were given every opportunity and every benefit of the doubt, when in truth, says Mr. Dubois, they should have been punished immediately.  That was the major difference; instead of punishment, duty, and morality, they were taught they had rights.  Each juvenile that was pampered, that was not taught right from wrong and had it proven by instinct, was the result of the moral failings of an adult above him or her.  They championed rights they lost all sense of duty, to any level of society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The saving grace of the Starship Troopers movie</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that I thought was very clever in the Starship Troopers film was the use of mock-newsreels to set the stage. Not only are they an interesting throwback to older wars, but they&#039;re so over-the-top in their obvious propaganda that they really drive the point home of just how entrenched this society is in its culture of &quot; citizenship &quot;. Scenes like the enlistment ads with the soldiers showing their weapons to little children, graphic depictions of the bugs&#039; carnage ( albeit with certain parts covered with Censored logos ), and kids joining the war effort by stepping on earth insects may seem overly exaggerated, until one realizes that even this kind of propaganda can be profoundly effective in the right climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially the scenes of the kids stomping on Earth bugs. That was profoundly disturbing to me when I considered that the bugs those kids were killing ( under their parents&#039; explicit approval ) were harmless. Harmless, but still a scapegoat, an allegorical stand-in for real life minorities that happen to be associated with their country&#039;s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s scenes like this that help convince me that the Starship Troopers film was indeed a clever parody of the novel, though all the obligatory Hollywood garbage ( giant firebreathing CGI monsters, romantic subplots, dying soldiers lasting just long enough to give a melodramatic passage, etc. ) could easily convince me to be more cynical about it. Still, I&#039;d like to think that the director really did have a purpose that got lost through all the executive meddling...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The only thing to do with a &#039;cult favorite&#039;: SEQUEL!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/30</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Because in Hollywood-speak, &#039;a horrible movie&#039; is called a &#039;cult favorite&#039; and sequels rule the universe, Sony Pictures in 2004 put out &#039;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation&#039;, a &#039;rapid-fire sequel to the cult favorite, [in which] the Federation&#039;s best Mobile Infantry unit goes back into action against the Bug horde.&#039;  A straight-to-DVD masterpiece!&lt;br /&gt;
And, according to imdb, they&#039;re making a THIRD one starring the original Johnny.  Really?  Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad photoshopped poster is worth a visit.&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>WTF, Paul Verhoeven.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/26</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently 4 minutes and 15 seconds into the movie Starship troopers, and I am absolutely sure that is has the worst opening sequence I have ever witnessed.  Perhaps it is because I just recently saw Cloverfield, which went a little too far down the documentary/shaky-cam road, but the little sequence &#039;on the battlefield&#039; was RIDICULOUS.  Let&#039;s even put aside the fact that a trained soldier continues to talk to the camera even though a Bug has (not sneakily at all) come around the corner and is about to snatch the soldier up in his semi-CGI, animatronic-looking maw.  Let&#039;s put aside the fact that the soldier takes time to shout over the sound of gunfire and comment, in melodramatic terms, on the aesthetics of the planet he&#039;s landed on.  We are evidently supposed to believe that the camera is being held by someone on the news crew, unarmed.  SO WHAT IS HE DOING??  The Bug comes roaring around a rock and bites a few soldiers in half, and he just stands there, evidently intelligent enough to aim the camera into the action but not intelligent enough to remove himself to a safer location (namely not one within arm&#039;s-length of the Bug).  He also has the steadiest hand I have ever seen, capable of smoothly swinging from Bug to shouting soldiers and back again.  He can apparently do this even while running; perhaps this is why he appears to be moving no faster than a brisk trot.  Once this faceless, brainless camera man has been put out of his misery by the Bug, his camera falls to the ground, allowing Rico to crawl toward it, his blindingly white teeth clenched prettily in pain and his eyes still open slightly, as if he is checking to make sure that he is still in frame so his bravery can be appropriately documented.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that came out more like a rant than I intended.  I apologize.  Please look to &#039;to whitewash or not to whitewash&#039; for a more measured and rational example of my response to Starship Troopers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Choice: Always a Hot Issue</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/25</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many things we discussed in class, there was one topic that intrigued me the most--perhaps because it was only briefly touched upon. Someone mentioned the apparent paradox that the enemy Bug society is pure communism and yet the human society considers that system ideal. Certainly it is intriguing that the M.I. are fighting against a system they have bought into. Consider the fact that people are only &quot;legal residents&quot; until they have served at least two years in the Federal Service, following their government&#039;s plans and putting the good of the nation before personal gain and safety. Only when they have overcome their individualism can they be a true citizen and thus gain the right to vote. The simple idea behind this is, of course, communism; each part must work to better the whole. Their society rewards the choice to follow communist ideals because they well know that communism makes a nation amazingly strong when it must fight. Of course, this is why it is so difficult to defeat the purely communist Bugs. The question is, if the human society considers communism ideal, what differentiates them from the Bugs? Are they not just as bad (or good, as the subjective analysis may read)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the difference is the choice, the completely voluntary decision to join the Federal Service. I say interestingly because choice is an individualistic ideal, while giving an affirmative to the choice presented will result in a dissolution of the self into simply a part of the whole. At the same time, this paradoxical nature of the choice maintains the importance of the individual, an idea that has always been valued in American culture and the belief that differentiates the humans from the Bugs. Indeed, the humans&#039; government as a whole appears rather human itself; it understands that the best option is to have a communist system when it comes to fighting a war, but at the same time, it wants its people to realize this on their own because they will make stronger, more passionate fighters. As humans, we naturally want something much more if we have chosen it (or believe the illusion that we have) than if we have been forced upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one question, however. Is the choice truly voluntary? It appears to be so, but the society definitely pushes its residents toward the &quot;right decision.&quot; Veterans can vote, usually hold better jobs, and appear to live more fulfilling lives. Also, at least in Juan&#039;s case, the conviction to join seems only to grow when authority figures question the certainty of the decision. Undoubtedly, there is at least a subconscious push toward joining the Federal Service. Perhaps that is why, as I believe Mr. Dubois mentions, there are too many unskilled or militarily incompetent people for whom random jobs must be created.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bugs in Starship Troopers as Nature, not Race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that it&#039;s a common trope in science fiction for ideas about divisions of race to be transplanted to racial boundaries â€“ as if the authors are saying, &quot;Look, if they can get along with wookies, why can&#039;t we humans all get along among ourselves?&quot; It&#039;s such a common device, in fact, that it becomes difficult to recognize when alien species are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent ethnicities. However, the Bugs from &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; may actually be something different â€“ for lack of a better term, I&#039;ll describe their presence as a force of Nature, not Race (with a capital R) in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the relationship between the humans of the Terran Federation and the Bugs doesn&#039;t resemble racial conflict â€“ the only interactions between the two are acts of destruction. Historically, racial conflict doesn&#039;t take the form of immediate, all-out war: the Europeans and American Indians were able to participate in trade and exchange of ideas before prejudice and hatred built up to cause the two sides to begin fighting each other; trade in slaves from Africa was facilitated at least by the cooperation of some leaders within that continent; even the American Civil War was not fought as a battle of &quot;black versus white&quot; at all. However, in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;, the two sides are not just completely at odds with each other militarily: the Terran Federation &quot;[understands] [the Bugs] as little as [it] [understands] termites&quot; (222). The Terran Federation doesn&#039;t even have the faintest idea what the Bugs&#039; motivation is for fighting or when it might be possible to declare peace â€“ they don&#039;t even really know how bugs live, other than the very basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bugs and the humans appears most obviously in Johnny&#039;s proof about war as a cause of population pressure: &quot;Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us outâ€“because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate&quot; (186). This begins to resemble the conflict between American Indians and Europeans, but in the case of the American Indians, as members of the same species, they ended up becoming somewhat mixed in with the European population that invaded â€“ no such thing is possible (as far as we can see) with the Bugs. The conflict is meant to be seen in a similar situation as that of the &quot;retarded&quot; wildlife of Sanctuary - &quot;When types that had evolved on a planet enjoying high radiation and fierce competition were introduced, the native stuff was outclassed&quot; (155). The humans and the Bugs in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t communicate, they don&#039;t intermarry and they certainly don&#039;t hold Thanksgiving dinners together before killing each other: they&#039;re opposing species from different environments, and when they come into conflict, it&#039;s kill or be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Responses to class discussions</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/23</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone in class on Monday had mentioned that in the MI, humans are the (vessel for) technology.  I think this is an interesting point, especially in conjunction with the developments of our current military.  The United States Army has been implementing robots in the Middle East to prevent unnecessary casualties.  Soldiers can now direct these robots, which can detect and disable mines and have the capability of firing back at any hostiles, with remote controls from a safe distance away.  There remains that element of human judgment, although in a much more diluted form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I had contemplated applying to West Point or joining RoTC; as for the use of this book by the various military academies in the United States, which was brought up in class, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scary thing.  Starship Troopers stresses loyalty to the government and to protection of the general population, as well as the concept of &quot;leave no man behind.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this book justifies violence in a way that makes sense (I&#039;m not saying I advocate it) and would mitigate the dissent of people who are against American troops in Iraq (namely those who harass soldiers or marines about &quot;supporting the war&quot;).  I pulled this particular quote because it reminded me of another quote (Was it Alfred Lord Tennyson who wrote &quot;Ours is not to reason why.  Ours is but to do or die.&quot;?): &quot;The purpose of war is to support your government&#039;s decisions by force...Not killing..but controlled and purposeful violence.  But it&#039;s not your business or mine to decide the purpose of the control.  It&#039;s never a soldier&#039;s business to decide when or where or how--or why--he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals...&quot; (63).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had watched the movie long before ever reading this book and I can remember my initial thoughts: Wow this movie must have been a low budget film.  After reading ST and re-watching the adaptation, I also noted that: 1]It&#039;s strange that most of the characters look/are white, but have retained their more &quot;ethnic&quot; names 2]Dizzy Flores is a female and 3]Women are allowed in the MI for the sake of gratuitous female nudity...?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Might Makes Right in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/22</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To continue a discussion begun in class today, what is the function of violence in Starship Troopers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note:&lt;br /&gt;
-Suffrage was available only to those who completed their 2(+) years of voluntary service.&lt;br /&gt;
-Those who wish to serve a term of service can participate in non-overtly-violent ways (as terraformers, technicians, logistics, and human guinea pigs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is violence the only way to gain merit in this society?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, we only see through the narrator&#039;s perspective, who quickly learns that &quot;The Mobile Infantry is the Army. All the others are either button pushers or professors, along merely to hand us the saw; we do the dirty work&quot; (p. 39). His account of transformation throughout boot camp resounds with descriptions of physical labor; along the way characters settle a multitude of  power struggles with hand-to-hand combat (e.g. introduction of sergeant Zim, the showerroom scene with Ace). Juan earns real respect only after his first drop, and his father&#039;s love is only clear when his father risks his own life as a member of the MI. Again and again it&#039;s the willingness to engage in violence (interestingly, success doesn&#039;t seem to matter as much) that &#039;separates the men from the boys.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this story sticks close to its moral that a man earns respect by demonstrating &quot;through voluntary and difficult service that he places the welfare of the group ahead of personal advantage&quot; (p. 182).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Test, and first response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/20</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whew, meant to do this earlier.  Well in any case, I don&#039;t read a whole lot of science fiction, but I thought ST was very interesting.  I agree that woman were placed on pedestals as something to fight for, but I did not get the feeling that they were any less important or empowered than the men were.  With all of the power, and yes danger included in the position of being a ship&#039;s captain, the woman captain have their fair share of the cake.  I think however that the purpose behind having the woman aboard did go beyond their abilities as pilots.  I remember a passage where Juan spoke of how the last voice an MI heard before the drop was the female captain starting the drop sequence.  This is somewhat akin to a mother&#039;s voice to her protected child, comforting them before sending them into a hostile world, and would be deeply comforting on some very basic, instinctual levels.  Perhaps then the woman serve not only as objects to admire, but also as &#039;mother&#039; figures on board, whether or not the MI&#039;s realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Test, and some thoughts.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/11</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;DOES THIS WORK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidding.  I just finished Starship Troopers, and was favorably impressed compared to the movie.  All I had remembered from the movie was a basic action movie set in space.  The book was clearly far deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, there seems to be a large amount of race and gender interplay in Starship Troopers.  Females being better pilots stood out from the beginning, and then there were numerous references to women as part of the reason why the M. I. fought.  Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come later?&lt;/p&gt;
