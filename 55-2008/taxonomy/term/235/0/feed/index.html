 <title>poetry &amp; language in &quot;stars in my pocket...&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/209</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something that I mentioned in class, but what particularly interests me about in Delany&#039;s book is the protagonist&#039;s relationship with poetry and carefully chosen language. I can&#039;t really even articulate it very well due to the sheer abundance of detail that is given, but poetry seems to be connected in his brain somehow with sex, desire, and a sort of ethereal musical harmony. This was the passage I found where it stands out the most: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The first sound came. (Why didn&#039;t he open his eyes?) I have heard some evelmi say that the untutored human voice is generally more pleasing to them in song than the trained one--even though they respect the training&#039;s intention. The rougher vibrations resemble the multiplicity of sounds from multiple tongues. What I heard first, by whatever part of the ear meters and measures and counts despite all conscious intention was...well, as clear as any pattern I&#039;d heard that many times...dactyl, spondee, dactyl, trochee...&quot; (pp. 254-255)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long passage, I know. I noticed that dactyls, spondees and trochees are different syllabic combinations used in formal poetry. What I got from my first glean of this passage was a deep-rooted desire for order and organization. The multiple vibrations resonating in harmony, the counting and metering of language, and his appreciation of poetic formality might be ways of finding sanctuary, by pretending that there is order in the midst of chaos, maybe? Ironically I sympathized with him because I was looking for some order in the chaos of this book! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a certain tactile quality that he recognizes in language and speech. shown by the images of tongues and vibrating voices. Sex has been so distanced from humanity in this book that it&#039;s possible that he&#039;s trying to re-connect them again, by reconnecting his words with his body. Anyway, I feel like this is a rambling mess, but I&#039;m curious to see what you all think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Detail in Delany&#039;s world</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/205</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part about Samuel Delany&#039;s Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand is the immense amount of detail he puts into his world.  In the introductory passage about Rat Korga, the amount of back-story in the world is simply incredible.  At first, the novel merely hints at interesting events, polar research stations, and the q-plague.  But when Korga is bought illegally and hooked up to General Information, the amount of work Delany has put into his world really shows.  Korga is soon asked what the four largest geosectors on the world are.  He answers perfectly, with four names that actually sound like they fit into the world he is on.  Next, the four smallest.  And yet again, Korga answers with names that fit into the world.  &quot;Hebel-E&quot; is my favorite, because it suggests something behind that strange hyphenated E at the end of the word.  The four names weren&#039;t merely random made up words; they seem to have some though behind them.  That really helps Delany&#039;s world come to life.  Next come the books that Korga reads.  He reads over 50 books, and to most authors that would be enough to say.  Delany on the other hand names almost all of them, and names that seem to make sense for the planet they live on.  Two are named a variant of sand, one after wind.  Each of the books has some sort of blurb given about it as Korga assimilates its text.  Here the sheer though Delany puts into his back story is amazing.  Not only does each novel fully realize itself, it also makes references to other authors and novels that Korga read, in a way that doesn&#039;t seem contrived.  When these books that Korga read fit together, they bring forth a life on the world that seems far stronger than that seen through the rat so far.  Delany is a master at giving hints of back-story, which fit in well with the story and keep the work entertaining.  Later on, he uses GI and Vondramach to do the same thing, fill in holes of information with interesting tidbits.  In the process he creates a very vibrant world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sygn and Family</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/203</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What acts and thoughts in day-to-day life separate a member of the Family from the Sygn? To begin with, one must make an attempt at determining the particular values of each faction. Keeping in mind the potential bias of the Sygn-affiliated narrator, the Family centers around the &quot;father-mother-sonâ€¦basic family unit&quot; (119). At the same time, the narrator emphasizes that the particular family structure itself matters less than the accompanying power structure. For an example, she suggests, &quot;in the Family structure, the parents are seen to protect and enclose the children, to protect them from society&quot; (120). The Sygn paradigm contains a multitude of alternatives, including the Dyeth&#039;s stream structure, in which &quot;the children are the connection between the parents and society&quot; (120). Sygn culture is about diversity of belief and liberal acceptance of differences â€“ even the Sygn itself has no set symbol, spelling, or pronunciation (97). In contrast, the Family can be characterized by a lack of flexibility. Their children are a representation of their entire way of life â€“ both need protecting from the countless alien alternatives existing in this vast universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Chris West offers really interesting insight into these issues in his article, &quot;Perverting Science Fiction: Thinking the Alien Within the Genre.&quot; He suggests that a key differnence between the Sygn and Family can be found in that &quot;the dominant culture on [the Sygn] section of their world does not subscribe to compulsory monogamy, nor to compulsoty heterosexuality, nor does it turn its face from interspecies liaison&quot; (West 108). Why does the sexual take on such an important role? To Family members, Sygn sexual behavior fails to protect their family&#039;s identity. It would already appear easy enough to lose one&#039;s identity and history in this universe of seemingly limitless people and information; promiscuous sex (and the associated risk of children outside of the protective Oedipal family structure embrace), homosexual/interspecies sex (and the abandonment of persuing children) further the threat to the fundamental unit of the Family worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, how does the issue of identity function within Sygn culture? Clearly this issue is the primary driving force of all Family interactions, as the control of information and contempt for the above-mentioned sexual behavior both derive from the same culture-propagation instinct. But does this exist within the Sygn? The narrator often discusses her ancestors and the Dyeth history. Historical cultural knowledge seems to be prized and is made readily available through the Web. Historical figures, Vondramach in particular, create context in which the characters interact and provide insight into the issues faced (so that history won&#039;t repeat itself? E.g. Availability of the rings for Rat Korgaâ€¦). A Sygn point of view, while inclusionary and adaptive, does seem to preserve some sense of appreciation of the past. The difference remains centered around how the two worldviews imagine going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possibility of a mixed-race president and multiracial people as the fastest growing race in the country, I think the implications for contemporary American politics are huge. Instead of obsessively persuing a return to life &#039;the way it was,&#039; the Sygn encourage moving forward toward cross-racial and cross-cultural interaction while remaining grounded in an understanding of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sorry Delany, I&#039;m Taking a Pass</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/202</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose the &quot;Joyce of science fiction&quot; review on the back should have been a warning, but I really thought I could make sense of this book. Maybe Cyteen will make up in clarity what it clearly lacks in brevity...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the end of days</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/200</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the conception of the Apocalypse in Samuel Delaney&#039;s Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand the most interesting part of the book.  Delaney&#039;s idea of how worlds end is so different from other books and from popular thought. For one thing, it is not really an Apocalypse, an end of days â€“ life, and culture, goes on even after a world has been destroyed by that enigmatic thing, the Cultural Fugue.  Secondly, the world does not end by asteroid collision, or by a trigger-happy country with too many nuclear warheads but by information, and by culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters are a little fuzzy in explaining exactly how information and culture destroys worlds, but it does not sound nearly as flashy.  The closest anyone gets to defining what constitutes a Cultural Fugue, that I could find at least, is when Marq Dyeth says Cultural Fugue happens when &quot;the socioeconomic pressuresâ€¦reach a point of technological recomplication and perturbation where the population completely destroys all life across the planetary surface&quot; (66).  Frustratingly vague for a reader who does not know when the critical point of &quot;technological recomplication and perturbation&quot; is generally reached, and how exactly the population destroys itself.  Would a nuclear holocaust fit under the umbrella of the Cultural Fugue?  Even if it does, it is presumably not the only way, so what other dastardly ways does life have of snuffing itself out?  Are they ways we have not even conceived of yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how exactly life ends, the general threat has been deemed to be information.  Exactly how one deals with such a threat is a major point of difference for the political movements of the worlds, but no one seems to deny that it does pose some kind of a threat.  In the prologue, the Rat&#039;s owner describes the boundless knowledge of General Information, then goes on to say: &quot;Can you imagine?  Living in a world where, if you want to know something â€“ anything, anything at all! â€“ all you have to do is think about it, and the answer pops into your head?  That&#039;s supposed to be how it works.  Even our Free-Informationists are scared to go that far.  They think we&#039;d slide over into Cultural Fugue in a minute!&quot; (24).  People need protection, not from guns or bombs or meteors, but from knowledge, which seems so innocuous in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is that the Apocalypse (I&#039;m not sure what else to call it) is something definite, a real threat that has actually happened in the recorded past and will definitely happen again, somewhere, in the future.  It is not some vague threat that may or may not ever happen.  In addition, the concept of the end of the world is not quite so catastrophic in Delaney&#039;s universe.  If one world ends, there are more around to continue.  They are there to take in the few survivors, mourn the dead, and carry on culture and society.  If my planet were to implode in Cultural Fugue, I wonder whether I would be reassured or annoyed that somewhere in the known universe, everyday life is toodling along, unconcerned with my death.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stars in my Pocket response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/197</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects I found in Stars in my Pocket like Grains of Sand was the difference between modern hunting and the &#039;dragon hunting&#039; between pgs 239 and 257.  At first, hunting in the deserts of Velm appears very similar to our human hunting; leaving for a wilderness area, using large &#039;weapons&#039;, receiving advice over territory or placement from an experienced hunter, and eventually finding and firing at the prey, taking something from the prey in the process. The first major difference here is the wanted result.  While real-world hunters seek to kill the prey as fast as possible and in good enough condition for food, skinning or other purposes, hunters on Velm desire to get a glimpse into the mind of the prey for a time and experience all of its senses.  Instead of taking and using for personal, material comfort or pleasure, the Velm hunter shares the preys&#039; experience, and leaves the creature untouched and completely unaware of the hunter&#039;s intrusions.&lt;br /&gt;
	Neither act is necessary; we have an abundance of food in the USA, and the inhabitants of Velm have many alternate sources of entertainment. Yet, both peoples still do it, and on a fairly common basis.  The Earth style of hunting creates a moral conundrum for the people, but has a more distinct purpose and culture behind it.  Hunting is one f the earliest arts that humanity ever developed; we started as nothing more than hunter-gatherers before tribal society emerged.  Later, at any stage in our progress before agriculture could be instated, or any time we expanded outward to new territory, hunting was a primary means of support.  In short, hunting was an integral part of our humanity, though today it may not be as important as in the developmental periods.  Unfortunately, we are missing one important piece of information:  while our form of hunting was at one time essential to survival in the pre-modern USA, we do not know if the Velm mode of hunting was ever crucial to evelm and/or humans on their planet.  The culture behind hunting is hinted at in the last part of the chapter (pg 251-257) when the narrator goes into depth explaining the importance of Singing after the hunt, but it still appears to be more for entertainment or art than survival.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think the major point here is that we still kill even having moved past the kill-for-food stage, which is both harmful and unnecessary.  We claim it is part of a great heritage, an art that should not be lost; yet with how destructive it is to the prey, is it really justified?  Should entertainment or tradition (since there is no longer necessity) come at such a cost?  It is through these differences between our planet and Velm that the key criticism of our ways appears most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Random thoughts on subscripts...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/193</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was browsing the blog and felt like I would try and comment on dragongrrl&#039;s note about hoping someone comments about the subscripts. My initial reaction was that they seemed a bit silly. As though Delany was somehow trying to make the novel look more scientific by adding subscripts in like one would add subscripts to variables or chemical equations. I was a bit disappointed by this, but as the story went on I came to understand that use of subscripts was an interesting was to differentiate between the type of relationship a person has with her different occupations. (Also, I couldn&#039;t get the subscripts to actually be subscripts, but oh well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the use of the subscripts was interesting basically because to me it seemed to imply different levels of connectedness between the person and their occupation. The first level was just what we would think of as a job. The place we go each day to make a living. For Marq, work1 was her job as an Industrial Diplomat, traveling about and getting various jobs completed.  When the students are introduced, it is mentioned that two of them have jobs1 as evelmian ethnologists. The relationship between an occupation1 and what we would consider an occupation seemed fairly straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was Marq&#039;s job2. I&#039;m still not totally sure what this was but it came across as something much more intrinsic than her job1 as an Industrial Diplomat. It almost seemed to me as though this was something that Marq had been expected to do for all of her life.  My impression of this comes from a part on page 108 when Marq is talking to Alsrod about how she has been trying since childhood to get the statue of Mother Dyeth to turn on. According to Alsrod, Marq was just doing part of her job2.  This mention of her job2, as well as other mentions, made me think that this occupation2 related in some way to an understanding of her home and family as well as a passing on of that knowledge. For instance, orientating the new students was considered Marq&#039;s job2, rather than job2 and the orientation sessions are referred to as sessions2 (191).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there was a certain level of occupation that each person had which was more intrinsic than what we would normally consider a job was quite interesting. People seem to have a job2 which they are expected to work towards for their entire lives, perhaps indicating that one&#039;s occupation2 and self are more closely connected than what we might normally consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a third level of job. Marq mention that her hands are &quot;of a fairly small, somewhat hairy fellow who only uses them for manual labor one job2 out of three&quot; (201). Unfortunately for me I didn&#039;t write down any other mentions of this third occupation although I think there was one place where a job3 was referred to.  My question about this job3 is; what could be deeper to Marq than her job2? Her job2 already seems to be an essential part of her character and something she has been doing her whole life, so I am curious as to what could be even more a part of her than this.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Planets in my mind</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/192</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects of Samuel Delany&#039;s &quot;Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand&quot; was the notion of proportion.  Certainly, the title is a powerful contributor to this theme.  Comparing stars, massive balls of matter whose energy and size are beyond the comprehension of the human mind, to the matter which causes the lining of pockets to be uncomfortable, conveys the basic disconnect in the perception of proportion in the book.  The descriptions continuously challenge the reader to conceptualize reality on a different scale than daily life promotes.&lt;br /&gt;
	This challenge comes primarily in the form of the perception of size.  The universe presented contains six thousand plus worlds where humans have settled, and the majority of those worlds contain on the order of hundreds of millions of people.  This alone stretches the ideas of the proportional significance of humanity.  As the world is today, it is difficult develop a notion of the whole of humanity.  While I can understand the world as it is in terms of nations and social classes and environmental surroundings, any sort of categorization applied to such diversity over hundreds of light-years seems like it would break down in my mind.  Yet, humanity has apparently adapted to the change in scale of the medium across which it operates.  For example, Vondramach is a historical figure which shows the new potential for a megalomaniac.  Her influence was on a completely different scale than what people are familiar with today.  She controlled multiple planets, and somehow managed to gain notoriety throughout all of humanity, years and years after her death, as dispersed as it was.  The magnitude of that kind of personality is incomprehensible.  How can a single person have such a large effect on a system which I can barely comprehend?&lt;br /&gt;
	This difficulty with size also appears in the discussions of cultural fugue.  This disease/cultural state, is described early in the book as the series of events which leads to the elimination of all life on planet.  When we first see Marq, he is performing his duties as an industrial diplomat on a planet inhabited by a strange gooey people, they ask him whether their planet is at risk for the cultural fugue, as if it is some natural disaster, with cause beyond their control.  They seem like they are no more able to control it than we are able to control global warming.  Yet, their fear doesn&#039;t seem to be based on a scientific correlation, but on some pre-established notion of how planetary life-cycle.  I believe this is also a reflection of the different proportion of perspective in this new universe.  Rather than analyze the problems of any individual world within it&#039;s own context, worlds are diagnosed the way the human body is.  All six thousand provide a larger context such that an individuals planet&#039;s problems no longer have the same significance, and can be compared qualitatively to the problems of others.  This leader asking whether her planet will experience the cultural fugue is like someone with poison oak and a cold asking the doctor whether she&#039;s got the bubonic plague.&lt;br /&gt;
	Truly, I think that the issue of the cultural fugue is the most disorienting aspect of the story.  Aside from the popular treatment of the issue, the destruction of all life on a planet is something incomprehensible, even to the characters of the story.  This issue is represented in the issue of survivors.  Marq latches on to the idea that there MUST be survivors of the scorched planet Rhyonon, but encounters difficulty in conceptualizing what that means.  Japril challenges him to think about what a survivor means in the context of an entire planet, saying, &quot;When a world is destroyed â€“a whole world, Marq--there are so many fuzzy edged phenomena,&quot; (149).  A planet is so large, and has such extensive influence, that to give the disaster any defined borders is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>un-gendering pronouns</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/191</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(Note: when writing &quot;employer,&quot; I did want to have the subscript 1 [I hope someone talks about this] but it didn&#039;t copy over to the blog and I don&#039;t know if/what html coding would do this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we started to discuss on Monday, one of the most intriguing and often startling things about Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand  by Samuel Delany is the use of &quot;she&quot; as the default pronoun for both male and female humans and nonhumans--collectively &quot;women.&quot; The first problem this presents, of course, is confusion for the reader, because the reader does not live in a world where this usage is the same. I was quite confused especially when in the beginning Marq is talking with her (I will attempt to discuss the world in its own terms) employer on Nepiy and calls both her employer and her employer&#039;s human friend &quot;she,&quot; while they call each other &quot;he&quot; (62). Eventually the reader finds out that &quot;she&quot; refers to anybody, while &quot;he&quot; refers to an object of sexual desire--both regardless of the biological sex of the woman in question. One thing this does is effectively remove cultural gender and renders differences in sex basically meaningless. In doing this, Delany shows how unnecessarily important gender is to our society--the reader constantly wonders about the gender of each individual character mentioned because it is rarely given, and when it is, it is given late in the introduction. Not only does this point out the problematic fascination for identification but it shows that a society can work fairly well without the constant identification we have. Interestingly, the step from modern society to the world(s) in Stars is not unlike the transfer from permanently gendered words in romance languages like Spanish to English which has mostly neutrals. The difference, of course, lies in the language of Marq&#039;s society. They use the same gendered pronouns we have today to talk about other women, but their meaning has completely changed. &quot;She&quot; doesn&#039;t mean a female woman, &quot;she&quot; means any woman. &quot;He&quot; means a woman to whom the speaker is sexually attracted, not a male woman. &quot;Woman,&quot; itself, has replaced the word &quot;person,&quot; which is quite helpful in the society in Stars because it can refer to any species, while &quot;person&quot; refers simply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another effect this new use of pronouns has on the society in Stars is the way sexuality is viewed. Intriguingly, male homosexuality seems the norm, not a deviation, in this society. Whether or not this is true, the appearance of it comes from two places. First, the first-person protagonist, Marq, is a homosexual male woman, so it is discussed in a very natural way. Second, the object one woman&#039;s desire is always &quot;he,&quot; and therefore male in our eyes, and thus the original woman is considered &quot;he&quot; in the eyes of the other; to the reader, this makes all sexual relations appear to be between male women. There is still, obviously, a variety of sexual preferences in the world of Stars, and (at least on Sygn worlds) sex in general seems a very free idea. No one particularly cares what or how much sex other women have. The argument could be made that by removing gender from the language helps create this general tolerance in the culture of the types of sexual relations that occur. Not only does this blur the lines of homo- and heterosexuality, but the language used in essence removes the reproduction aspect of sex (&quot;sperm and egg,&quot; as Marq puts it) and leaves sex simply as a pleasurable act. There are many other techniques this society uses for reproduction, as evidenced by the great variety of genes that make up the members of Marq&#039;s family, or stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note about the language usage is something that was briefly mentioned in class but not discussed: Why did Delany pick the female as the neutral, default term? Considering Le Guin&#039;s choice of the opposite and the way we often write, this does appear strange. Likely, Delany wanted to point out how neither term, to us, really is neutral--because if they were, why would we complain about using the female as the baseline? It was startling to read a book written this way, and I often found myself replacing &quot;women&quot; with &quot;men&quot; because I&#039;m used to understanding groups of people in terms of the so-called neutral male status. What&#039;s even more intriguing to me is something that we discussed Monday night in my neuroscience class that I&#039;m not sure Delany knew: the baseline sex for humans is indeed female. Human fetuses, until about eight weeks old, have two sets of possible genitalia--one of which ends up disappearing, the other of which grows into either male or female sex organs. At about eight weeks, if the fetus is genetically male, the Y-chromosome sparks the growth of male gonads which release testosterone and prompt the growth male genitalia. If it is genetically female or, for some reason, this testosterone release is never initiated, the fetus will become a female baby--whether or not it should be male based on its genes.&lt;/p&gt;
