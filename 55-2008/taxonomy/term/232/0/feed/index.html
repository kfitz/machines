 <title>Hopkinson&#039;s Anti-Posthumanism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/291</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a topic we talked about a little in class today, but since my paper is on posthumanism, I&#039;m having a little trouble thinking about anything else, so I&#039;m going to go for it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;
To my mind, this is one of the most anti-posthumanist novels we&#039;ve read thus far in the class, which I find most interesting considering just how little the novel exposes us to advanced technology, since most of the storyline takes place in the primitive society of New Half-Way Tree.  Hopkinson does a little bit of the typical anti-transhumanism presentation in the obvious perversity of a theoretically positive advance. Generally speaking, I get so caught up in the storyline of a novel that I have a hard time picking up on subtle undertones, components of a universe that are overtly presented as positive, when really maybe we&#039;re supposed to see them as nefarious.  I have the worst time with unpleasant technological advances, because my first inclination is to think of technology as progressive.  But when Ione realizes the sheriffs are arresting Antonio and says &quot;Nanny save we!&quot; I was profoundly disturbed (64).  The grand anansi is so powerful, that its nickname is used in place of God.  It happens again, after he finds out Quashee is dead, Antonio says &quot;Nanny have mercy&quot; where the implied continued thought is â€¦on my soul (70).  Nanny has become so pervasive that people are essentially praying to a machine for salvation.  There&#039;s also the very creepy final passage, when we realize that the nanobots have made their way into Tan-Tan&#039;s child, without Tan-Tan&#039;s consent, let alone the child&#039;s.&lt;br /&gt;
I also see the novel as anti-transhumanist in its absolute corporeality. One of the overarching goals for posthumanists is to fully disengage from the body, and become an unbounded entity in cyberspace, or some analogous structure, as we saw with Case in Neuromancer.  Nalo Hopkinson rejects disembodiment and fully embraces the importance of corporal reality.  We see this, as mentioned in class, in the fact that the technology (nanomites) inhabits the body, rather than having the mind moving into cyberspace.  I also see it in Tan-Tan&#039;s pregnancy.  Incorporating such a purely physical phenomenon into the story reinforces the importance of the corporal over the ethereal.  I also read Brown Girl in the Ring, and see a similar trend in that novel as well.  Again, the human bodies are possessed, and actually physically changed by the spirits.  The main character resolves a conflict by hands-on fighting, which we haven&#039;t seen much of previously in this class.  In an altered state, she lifts a man off the ground with two fingers.  The most powerful force in the book, the duppy-bowl is powered by human blood rather than code, thoughts, or information, and to break its power, the main character has to break a physical object, which, once broken, reveals all the physical things its made of: &quot;reeking clumps of dirt; a twist of hair; white knuckle bones; the black, mummified body of what looked like a dead cat&quot; (204).  The final showdown then makes the conflict explicit.  The villain says &quot;that body don&#039;t have to be your home no more. You don&#039;t have to feel pain no more, sweetheart.  Your granddaddy could help you.  After I speak the right words, the powder you take will give your spirit strength to act on it own, without the body.  Let your spirit talk to me&quot; (216).  And though over the course of the novel, the main character expresses a fair amount of discontent with her body, she overcomes that discontent and rejects becoming a disembodied entity, regardless of the pain her body sometimes brings.&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I thought it was very cool that Hopkinson could push away technology not only using the typical presentation of a seemingly benevolent technology gone horribly, horribly wrong, but also through a very firm embrace of the natural, corporeal world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Post-Humanism, Part One: Experiences in the Class Thus Far</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/189</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me about several of the novels we&#039;ve read thus far is that their speculation is based on human biology; specifically, the attempt to alter and control it. In the past I came across a word for this; post-humanism, a nebulous and ill-defined term, but one ultimately centered around the concept of building better humans. There have been aspects of this in most of the books we&#039;ve read, such as...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Starship Troopers: The soldiers rely even more on science than any in our history. The M-I are not so much foot soldiers as pilots for their suits, the equivalent of a second skin that enhances their durability and movement. The suits are much more personal than any conventional military vehicle, to the point where they move based on feedback from the pilot&#039;s body motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Neuromancer: Practically everyone is altered in some way; Case is described as a wasted human body whose utility is based primarily on his digital self. Molly takes a physical role, but she&#039;s full of various machines, such as her claws and her eyes. And there are characters like Wintermute and Neuromancer who act sentient, but that are hard to classify as human because they lack any biological components. Artificial intelligence, but hardly robotic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and The Left Hand of Darkness: Much harder to classify as post-human, because they&#039;re more about the examination of sexual relationships than scientific ones; not mutually exclusive, but generally these books are more about exploring biology as it is than what it could be. Still, the characters are altered in various ways; the Handmaid&#039;s Tale shows an attempt to control reproduction ( more socially than scientifically ), and The Left Hand of Darkness has the hemaphrodite characters use drugs to accelerate/stunt their &quot; kemmer &quot; period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Lilith&#039;s Brood: Probably the most post-human focused of all the books we&#039;ve read, because it not only has humans being altered by alien technology, but the results of that alteration across the generations. The Oankali, with their biological machines, attach new genes that change the human body. Not just in terms of healing the sick, but strengthening the basic human structure; Lilith is the best example, as she gains enhanced strength, regenerative powers, the ability to interface with the walls of the ship, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand: I&#039;m still working through this book as of this post, but the fact that &quot; rats &quot; ( humans altered to have enhanced capabilites and removed free will ) play so heavily into it suggests that similar ideas will come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these patterns is quite interesting; I&#039;ll have more comments on the post-human connections later...&lt;/p&gt;
