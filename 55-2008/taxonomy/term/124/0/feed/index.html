 <title>sexuality &amp; power dynamic in lilith&#039;s brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/162</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, I really enjoyed reading this book; in my opinion it does a far better job of presenting an alternative view of gender than Left Hand of Darkness did. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d necessarily want our civilization to evolve in this direction gender-wise, but clearly Oankali society functions quite smoothly even with a lack of duality. The message is that this kind of functioning is possible for us. Lilith&#039;s Brood is a feminist work in the best sense because it promotes and presents a model of true gender equality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the ooloi or &quot;third&quot; gender, who are both male and female integrated, seem to wield most of the power and influence in Oankali society, They take the primary role in procreation and are respected as &quot;treasured strangers&quot; (pp.106). The female Oankali follow just behind them in status, and the males are actually the calmest and most passive. Ultimately, however, an Oankali&#039;s gender is of little consequence; though ooloi, those of the gender that would be most unfamiliar to humans, are the ones specifically bred to work with humans.&lt;br /&gt;
The structure of Oankali society forces the reader (and the human characters) to confront and accept functional androgyny, and possibly even respect it. It is interesting that even with this degree of control and extra ability, ooloi are still called &quot;outsiders&quot;; perhaps to gradually get the reader audience used to such an idea? I&#039;m not certain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved how among the Oankali, sex is not demonized, it is embraced, and yet made very scientific at the same time. Sex is &quot;shared&quot; rather than being &quot;had&quot;. Possession has nothing to do with it; the experience is either sensual and about pleasure, or neutral and merely biological. The process of maturing sexually has an almost-sacred significance and is referred to as a &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. Oankali do not have a separate set of sexual organs; sensory arms are &quot;very flexible, very versatile, but only another limb&quot; (pp.110). Oankali do not struggle with sexuality and obsess over pleasure to the same degree that humans do, and yet, it is what they live for in a way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part of the gender model in this book that maybe doesn&#039;t work so well is the &quot;demonizing&quot; of the human male. I&#039;m sure that most human men probably would go a little bonkers after not having sex for months, but I doubt that it would drive them all to violence and total dehumanization of women in their minds. In other words, Paul Titus bothers me. It&#039;s interesting that the Oankali treated two humans the way that we treat animals today; put &#039;em in a cage and wait until they mate. However, what do animals do if they don&#039;t want to mate? They just don&#039;t! No killing or injury involved. I think that human men are being deliberately portrayed as &quot;out of control&quot; but it&#039;s an unfair generalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a conversation between Lilith and Tate Marah, the first woman that she Awakens, where many interesting things show up:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Who are you Awakening?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Leah Bede and Celene Iver.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Two more women? Why don&#039;t you wake up a man?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I will eventually.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;You&#039;re still thinking about your Paul Titus, aren&#039;t you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;He wasn&#039;t mine.&quot; She wished that she had not told Tate about him.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Awaken a man next, Lilith. The guy who was found protecting the kids.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;On the theory that if you fall off a horse, you should immediately get back on?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Tate, once he&#039;s Awake, he stays Awake. He&#039;s used to ordering people around. He can&#039;t save us or protect us but he can damn sure screw us up.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;So what, you&#039;re going to wait until you can Awaken him to a kind of harem?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Tate seems to be driven by typical female desires: the wish to be protected, and sexual desire. Lilith is thinking of the whole group and who will be the most useful, not worrying about her own ability to function sexually. However, they are almost turning some tables and treating the man in question like an object, an animal who would be unable to control himself simply because he is outnumbered by women. This is an interesting experiment to look at, but it is basically reverse-sexist, and probably wouldn&#039;t work so well in our human society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>barbarella as feminist?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/132</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I think Barbarella rocks.  Also, I found it to be suprisingly feminist, considering - well, considering everything.  On the surface it&#039;s pretty wonderful in its unselfconscious exploitation of Fonda&#039;s sexuality, but its underlying concepts are much more subversive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.  The guy that sticks around the longest in the film, and the closest thing the film has to a male protagonist.  He&#039;s far from being the standard hero type; actually he&#039;s pretty useless.  He walks into walls and just stands around until Barbarella shouts directions at him, which he quickly obeys before lapsing back into passivity.  She thanks him for saving her life in the appropriately breathless damsel-in-distress fashion, but it&#039;s pretty clear to the audience that he was little more than an extra set of appendages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Barbarella wastes a lot of time repeatedly rescuing him.  She returns to Pygar his power of flight and tells the evil tyrant to &#039;decrucify the angel or I&#039;ll MELT YOUR FACE,&#039; among other things.  He never really redeems himself.  True, he flies Barbarella into and out of the tyrant&#039;s liar, but the way Barbarella asks, the viewer gets the impression that he&#039;s just the quickest and cheapest mode of transportation and she could find another way if she REALLY wanted.  He acts as little more than motivation for the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any strong male character there to hijack the movie from her, Barbarella is the undisputed star of the show.  Yes, she sleeps with pretty much every (post-puberty) male character she encounters, but she does it without really being sexual at all.  Men beg to sleep with her, and if it&#039;s in her best interests, she shrugs cheerily and says okay.  Sex isn&#039;t taboo, dangerous, or shameful at all for her, so she has no resigned, defeated air of a woman with no other options - no &#039;weeping vrgin&#039; stereotype.  And though she often sleeps with men as a means to an end, neither does she destroy them as do exoticised &#039;black widow&#039; character types.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the movie has distinctly pornographic overtones, it is difficult to really place Barbarella (the character, though not Jane Fonda the actress) in a traditional position of desire.  There is no thrill of excitement, danger, or taboo with her, and it&#039;s much harder to desire and lust over a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Nobody Gets Off Easy - In Support of Atwood&#039;s Feminism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/107</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first post on this novel, I immediately took the side of Luke, against what I perceived to be an unjust representation of men. I seem, as a side effect, to have ignited a flame war between RoseBlack, JackKerouacSucks, and the world. As a result of that war, in addition to the conversation that we had in class, I&#039;ve taken the time to look closely at my opinions on this novel. As much as it galls me to admit in a public forum, my first impression was quite narrow-minded, and reveals the basic prejudice with which I read feminist literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note to RoseBlack â€“ I think that one of the most detrimental effects of personal attacks in debate is the resulting difficulty for people to change their opinions on further thought without losing face to their attacker.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that I was strictly wrong in my first post. I still have little respect for Luke&#039;s character (though I no longer assign his opinions to Atwood). The narrator clearly loved Luke (Seeing the corpses of dissidents hanging outside, she makes sure none of them is Luke (33)), and in my opinion that colored her reactions to him, giving him a more favorable portrayal in the novel than he otherwise might have. In the first stages of their relationship, the narrator was the second woman in Luke&#039;s life. In competing with another woman, she must love more, love better in order to win the ultimate prize â€“ Luke. Because of this, I think, she is more willing to see Luke in a better light, even after he has left his wife. Once she loses her job, she doesn&#039;t go on any of the protest marches, because she must &quot;think about them, my family, him and her. [She] did think about my family. [She] started doing more housework, more baking&quot; (180). When Luke wants to have sex after she lost her job, she meekly finishes his sentence, &quot;We still have each other&quot; (182). She cannot seem to see him in a bad light, even though he does not resist anything that is happening to her, for the large part of their time together.&lt;br /&gt;
Even when he does resist, it is far too late. He has waited too long, been complicit too long, for his last gesture to make any difference. I would go so far as to say that the failure of their escape attempt is his fault. They lived in a society in which men increasingly had all the power (literally), and with that responsibility, Luke did nothing, until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in going back over my thoughts, I&#039;ve realized that Luke is by far not the only character to deserve scorn in the novel. In fact, his ability to so totally undermine his wife&#039;s way of life displays the complicity of the narrator, as well. She is very passive, throughout the book. She meekly follows the orders of Serena Joy, to get pregnant with Nick. She follows the summons of the commander, every night he calls her, and follows him to Jezebel&#039;s without resistance. There are many more examples, but these cases come after the advent of Gilead, and so it could be argued that they display only her post-oppression psyche. However, in the time before, she displayed the same passivity. When her job was taken away, she &quot;thought [she] should do something, take steps; but [she] didn&#039;t know what steps she could take&quot; (177). She is not a strong woman, by any means, and in being indecisive at that key juncture, she displays her willingness to accept what is coming, instead of face and resist it. She goes so far as to ask &quot;What was it about this that made us feel that we deserved it?&quot; (177). It is clear that her passivity stems from something deeper than the meekness ingrained by Gilead. In reading the novel from her perspective, it is easy to see the faults of others, instead of examining the way the she herself interacts with her world. I think that is one of Atwood&#039;s greatest achievements in this book, is to make the narrator&#039;s thought process seem normal, seem right, and lure us as readers into the same complicity and passivity that the narrator exhibits. The examples of Luke, of the commander, of the horrible things that men do, serve as a prod to encourage a deeper analysis, to discover the distorting lens through which the entire story is told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator is not the only one. I could go through the characters of the book, and find their faults, their role in the downfall of their nation. Nearly every character has a serious flaw, from Nick, who is &quot;indifferent to what I have to say, alive only to the possibilities of my body,&quot; to Janine, who submits to the other handmaid&#039;s blaming her for her own rape, and finally admits that it was her fault (270).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one character, in my opinion, who deserves commendation â€“ Moira. She has her flaws, of course â€“ she smokes, she constantly mooches off of others, she is overtly sexual, and doesn&#039;t frown on being a whore in Jezebel&#039;s â€“ but their obviousness belies the depth of her character. She resists everything that is done to her, and maintains her attitude even through everything she&#039;s been to before Jezebel&#039;s. Every other character in the novel has been subsumed in the culture of Gilead, and is in some way responsible for its formation. They exist in a fog of selfishness, passivity, apathy, and only Moira stands out in resistance. Even when the narrator escapes, through the fake Eye van, it is not by her will, not through her resistance, but only because she has friends in the right places, and they act for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Moira act for herself, but she brings good around her in everyone she meets. When she&#039;s escaping, she inspires people to take her in, despite the risk. In one of the only examples of actual organized resistance in the book, she is whisked toward the border by &quot;people who didn&#039;t like the way things were going&quot; (247). These are normal citizens, not people in power, and the proximity of their mention to Moira further accentuates the quality that women like her can bring to the oppressive Gilead society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moira is strong enough to resist Gilead, without the vitriol that the narrator&#039;s mother pours on everything she opposes. In fact, Moira is the feminist that Atwood believes every woman should be â€“ strong, independent, but looking out for herself as a person acting against oppression, and not a woman acting against men. And that&#039;s a feminist that I can support, wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Offred&#039;s mother</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/95</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuman&#039;s article &quot;Just a Backlash&quot; forced me to do a closer reading of the various representations of feminism in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale.  I was most taken aback by Atwood&#039;s strong resistance to being labeled a feminist.  While she fittingly points out that &quot;No one who observes society can fail to make observations that are feminist&quot; (858), she is also quick to critique the more extreme form of feminism.  She claims, &quot;If practical, hardline, anti-male feminists took over and became the government, I would resist them.&quot;  Atwood&#039;s self-identification as a &#039;tamer&#039; feminist brings up the question of what the female characters within the novel truly represent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though her physical presence in the book is minimal, I found Offred&#039;s mother to be one of the most interesting characters.  With her book burnings and banner protests, the mother personifies the 1970&#039;s feminist.  She adamantly claims that there is no room for a man in her life; she asks Offred, &quot;What use are they except for 10 seconds&#039; worth of half babies&quot; (12).  The mother is the feminist who Atwood never wants to be associated with.  The mother thinks herself superior to men, at the very least in an intellectual sense.  She credits them for their ability to fix cars and play football but not much else.  Offred&#039;s mother does not seek equality for men and women; rather she would most likely be content if the male race was wiped out completely.  However, she made a comment to Offred that struck me as sad and contradictory.  Only a few lines after criticizing Offred for not understanding all that had been done for female rights, Offred paints quite a different picture of her mother.  She writes, &quot;Sometimes she would cry.  I was so lonely, she&#039;d say.  You have no idea how lonely I was.  And I had friends, I was a lucky one, but I was lonely anyway&quot; (122).  I could not help but imagine that she was so lonely because she did not have a man.  With this statement I am hardly attempting to take the stance that every straight woman needs a man in her life to feel complete.  But I do believe her admittance to feeling lonely gives the mother a side that does perhaps desire a man.  She says she had friends but they were clearly not enough.  She needed a space filled in her life and often this space is fulfilled by the presence of a man to love or at least care for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is not much more to read into this brief moment of vulnerability, but I suspect Atwood is criticizing the man-hating feminist that does not necessarily seek progression into equal rights.  No matter how much feminists may categorize men as chauvinists only driven by sex and sports, ultimately, they can not fully deny the need for men.  Fine, Offred&#039;s mother knows that men are needed to reproduce but she is less willing to admit that at times, she missed the simple touch of a man.  While they clearly had different objectives in mind, in some ways, I found the Aunts to be an extreme representation of the 1970s feminist.  Of course they were strict enforcers of the rules of a government that oppressed women.  But they also encouraged the girls to take advantage of the sexual control they had over men.  Even in the disgusting scene where the girls were encouraged to blame Janine for being raped, the Aunts wanted the girls to take responsibility for their roles as sexual beings.  Men were depicted as little more than sperm donors.  Clearly the Aunts are not shining images of feminist ideals but it is worth considering them as a terrifying depiction of that &quot;hardline&quot; feminist taking over the government.&lt;/p&gt;
