 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading Oryx and Crake, I was fascinated by the narrative structure that Atwood uses to tell her characters&#039; story.  At first, it was extremely confusing: it was difficult to tell the point at which Jimmy stopped and Snowman began.  However, once I acclimated to this technique, I found it really interesting.  After recognizing the differences between Jimmy and Snowman, I realized that pretty much every character has at least two identities, although they are not necessarily as clear-cut as those of the narrator.  Crake is another such character, although his latter identity essentially overtakes the former: &quot;Snowman has trouble thinking of Crake as Glenn, so thoroughly has Crake&#039;s later persona blotted out his earlier one&quot; (Atwood 71).  Oryx is just as fragmented as Snowman and Crake, in many ways: &quot;How long had it taken him to piece her together from the slivers of her he&#039;d gathered and hoarded so carefully? There was Crake&#039;s story about her, and Jimmy&#039;s story about her as wellâ€¦and then there was her own story about herselfâ€¦There must once have been other versions of herâ€¦&quot; (Atwood 114).  Snowman himself seems attached to this idea that humans have dual identities.  When presented with the character of Jack, the pornographer from Oryx&#039;s childhood, he demands to know not just the name by which Oryx knows him, but &quot;his other name&quot; (Atwood 143).  Atwood links the concept of identity with name, suggesting that a name has an underlying power to create one&#039;s identity.  She also interconnects the concept of self-identity with that of identity presented by others, implying that multiple stories co-exist within one person.  However, it seems unclear whether or not these identities can actually co-exist.  Are they, instead, exclusive?&lt;br /&gt;
	Snowman and Jimmy seem to be one example in which two separate identities cannot co-exist.  Instead, at the moment when he meets the Crakers, he decides that &quot;he no longer wanted to be Jimmy, or even Jim, and especially not Thickneyâ€¦He needed to forget the past--the distant past, the immediate past, the past in any form&quot; (Atwood 348).  However, Snowman is unable to fully escape his past, even at the very end of the novel.  The last page illustrates this as Snowman hears echoes from his past: &quot;Oh Jimmy, you were so funny&quot; (Atwood 374).  Even at the very end of the novel, Snowman is unable to let go of his identity as Jimmy.&lt;br /&gt;
	In contrast to Snowman, whose present identity seems consumed by that of his past, Crake&#039;s past seems completely overwhelmed by his future.  To Snowman, Crake&#039;s past identity as Glenn is nothing more than &quot;a disguise.&quot;  Unable to reconcile the persona of Glenn with that of Crake, Snowman claims, &quot;The Crake side of him must have been there from the beginning&quot; (Atwood 71).  However, this idea of Crake&#039;s latter identity as omnipresent clashes with Snowman&#039;s own desire to reject and forget his past.  Atwood seems to imply, through Crake&#039;s persistent identity and Snowman&#039;s own inability to actually forget his past, that identity is an underlying facet to one&#039;s personality, something that cannot actually be changed.&lt;br /&gt;
	The character of Oryx is an interesting mesh of identities, since her actual character seems rather vague throughout the entire novel. I found her identity especially interesting because she means so many different things to so many different characters. Snowman himself has an entire persona built up around the picture of her that he printed off from a porno site when he was fourteen, but Oryx seems unsure of whether or not it is actually her.  At times, Oryx seems like nothing more than a construct, some sort of idealistic girl dreamt up by Crake and Jimmy when they were fourteen.  The Crakers&#039; association with her does little to dissuade this image, since she becomes a sort of goddess in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much identity!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/232</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I would agree with Moller when she says that to label this novel solely as a humanist work about the nature of human identity completely misses the novel&#039;s social and political ramifications, the exploration of identity is an interesting facet of the novel to explore.  It&#039;s also such an obvious part of the novel, that to ignore it is impossible.  Lore has three &quot;identities,&quot; as represented by the different tenses and perspectives, as we talked about in class.  Not only does each Lore&#039;s storyline end with a convenient climax, they also begin with a birth.  First, her original birth.  Then she arrives naked &quot;curled in a fetal position&quot; in a new city (5).  Then, she implants herself with a new identity.  But the overarching question remains, are these rebirths really new starts, or are they just the same Lore, but in a new environment?  I see the novel as presenting two pretty conflicting ideas of identity.  The first is that there is some sort of intrinsic identity, that who you are is static, even in the face of a changing environment.  At other times, the novel seems to suggest that your identity is based more on other people&#039;s perceptions of you than anything inherent within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Nature is a strong theme in the novel, more so than in a lot of the other novels we&#039;re read this semester. It is set soon enough in the future that wild things still exists, but far enough away that they are more precious, so when they do show up, they are significant.  Lore describes the trees dying in Spanner&#039;s apartment as strong, you can &quot;drench it in acid rain and infest it with parasites, carve initials in its bark and split branch from trunk, and it will survive&quot; (56).  External conditions don&#039;t wear down the tree, even under outside pressures, it keeps going.  Similarly, Lore continues to be Lore even with the outside pressure to be Sal Bird.  She wants to adopt Sal Bird&#039;s identity, say only the types of things Sal Bird would say, but because she &quot;couldn&#039;t bear to see a system fail due to simple ignorance&quot; she knowingly risks being found out (75).  There are certain aspects of herself that Lore simply cannot suppress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	At the same time, Lore is strongly affected by her interpersonal relationships.  With Spanner, she does some terrible things that she would not have done otherwise.  After a particularly bad night, she vomits in disgust at her actions and repeats &quot;It wasn&#039;t me, it wasn&#039;t meâ€¦&quot; (262).  She knows that her old self would be disgusted with what she does now somewhat willingly, as she admits to Spanner.  Also, Lore thoroughly discards her identity as a van de Oest after the kidnapping.  She dyes her hair, adopts an accent and discards her family as always having been different from her.  However, the moment someone besides Spanner learns that she is in fact a van de Oest, she falls back into old patterns.  She is a van de Oest. Magyar she said &quot;couldn&#039;t just dismiss me, as if I were anyone else&quot; (282).  So here, it seems Lore seems to be who other people think Lore is, rather than having an identity based on anything she creates herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	I&#039;m not sure whether Griffith was trying to push one perspective or the other, though I&#039;m inclined to think that we are more outwardly determined than we would like to think.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lore&#039;s dependency issues</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/230</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on &quot;Slow River,&quot; everyone is obviously interested in what the book has to say about identity.  Lore constantly struggles with her inability to ever truly inhabit one of her three characters.  &quot;I slept for nine hours and woke up feeling stiff and sore, as though my body had tried to rearrange itself physically to fit three people inside one skin. (294)&quot; The persona of Bird seems rather insignificant to me because while this is the PIDA Lore has adapted, she never really replaces Bird&#039;s place in the world.  The taking on of Bird&#039;s identity is a purely technical process.  Lore never actually becomes Bird in an emotional sense - she knows nothing of Bird&#039;s history in regards to family and relationships.  While in the work environment Lore does consider what Bird&#039;s actions would be, she never succeeds at suppressing her knowledge, as proven by Magyar&#039;s quick suspicions.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my reading, Lore is Lore of the van de Oest family, Spanner&#039;s Lore or Magyar&#039;s Lore.  Her personality and actions are dependent on the people who surround her.  When growing up with her family, Lore is always bending over backwards to please her parents.  Lore&#039;s desire for Katerine&#039;s approval is what drives her work ethic and ultimately blinds her to her mother&#039;s horrific behavior.  Lore&#039;s life goals were decided for her at birth and she has little say in the matter.  She is disgusted by Stella&#039;s rebellious ways and does not realize till it&#039;s too late that Stella was actually trying to define herself as a separate entity from her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Lore proves her strength and grit when she attacks her kidnapper and escapes.  But then Spanner takes her under her wing and forms Lore&#039;s new identity.  Lore takes on a life of crime and deceit.  At her worse moment, Lore is under the spell of not only Spanner, but also the drug that she consumes in order to tolerate the prostitution Spanner has forced her into.  While Lore continually feels shame for the acts she commits, she does not have the confidence in her own identity to break away from Spanner.  She loses respect for herself and eventually projects this onto Spanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lore finally does leave Spanner, she quickly finds someone else to base her personality off of â€“ Magyar.  Lore&#039;s relationship with Magyar is a sharp contrast to her certainly dysfunctional relationship with Spanner.  While her time with Spanner was greatly defined by sex, Lore&#039;s connection with Magyar is much more rooted in emotions.  She tells Magyar, &quot;I&#039;ve never had any romance, ever.  But how could I?  I&#039;ve been so many people, I never knew which ones were real.  I want to find that out before you and Iâ€¦ before we go any further. (300)&quot; At this moment, Lore is expressing that she wants to recognize her true self before being defined by her bond with someone else.  Yet I doubt that she ever really does this.  Magyar is the one who forces Lore to face her demons and attempt to reconstruct her life by contacting her father.  Who knows if Lore would have ever found the motivation to call her father if it weren&#039;t for Magyar and Spanner.  I found the final sentence to be sweet but also disturbing.   After just reclaiming her identity as Francis Lorien van de Oest, Lore walks with Magyar and thinks, &quot;When I met my family again, I would introduce them to both of us. (343)&quot; Clearly, Magyar is a positive force in Lore&#039;s life but what happened to her claim that she was going to find herself before progressing the relationship?  Shouting out your name does not mean you know yourself.  The fact that she wants to reconnect with her family with Magyar by her side implies that she has not really discovered herself.  Rather, she is still depending on a stronger partner to carry her through life&#039;s discomforts.&lt;/p&gt;
