 <title>Gattaca</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/220</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gattaca is a difficult and interesting movie. I find my feelings about its subject matter to be very much split between the positive and negative; while genetic manipulation provides great advances and has considerable potential, the movie makes clear the potential cost as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two potential benefits of genetic engineering which the movie touches on seem of particular interest to me. The first is the relatively obvious one: reversal of our genetic stagnation. As our medical sciences have advanced, our ability to keep people alive and reproductively sound--despite genetic or physiological flaws which would have otherwise precluded survival--has increased. While this is undeniably a good thing, it has the unfortunate side effect of having effectively stopped our species ability to move forward on a genetic level. Genetic engineering circumvents this problem; Darwinism becomes artificial and consciously driven, but is at least reintroduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interesting side-effect of large scale genetic manipulation of humanity--and an attendant public knowledge about the basic realities of genetics--is that it renders the race issue essentially moot. Genetic differentiation between races today is essentially negligible anyways; what becomes important in society is not superficial differences, but quantifiable genetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the artificial Darwinism introduced by the movie; while in the long run it will be beneficial to the species, it is the inherent model of Darwinism, that few are winners and many are losers, so to speak, that is the cause of our protagonist&#039;s troubles. The fundamental question raised by the movie, for which I have no answer, is this: our species must change in order to move forward and survive. How many is it acceptable to sacrifice along the way?&lt;/p&gt;
