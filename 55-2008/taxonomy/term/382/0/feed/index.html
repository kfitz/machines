 <description>&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Contains season 2 spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my last shot at extra credit, though BSG is still fresh and new enough in my mind that I&#039;m pretty hesitant to dissect it.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen three texts so far this semester that deal with the almost total extinction of the human race.  Of the three, to me it seems that Battlestar Galactica presents the best case that the humans are worth saving.&lt;br /&gt;
In Xenogenesis the resisters fight for the preservation of humanity, but the version of humanity they represent really doesn&#039;t seem worth preserving.  They exhibit violence and racism. They turn on even the other humans, raid their camps and steal their women.  Some of them refuse to fraternize with humans of different skin tones, even when there are so few humans left at all.  In Oryx and Crake the humans also seemed beyond redemption.  They had reached new lows in depravity, in science (the ChickieNobs &quot;chickens&quot;) and recreation (Crake and Jimmy&#039;s internet hotspots).&lt;br /&gt;
	Battlestar Galactica is the first time that we seem (a non-mad-scientist) human really realize the flaws within the human race, and come to the conclusion that we might not be worth saving.  And yet I think that it&#039;s the most hopeful in that respect of the three texts.  The survivors are generally speaking pretty likable, more so than the resisters in Xenogenesis and Oryx and Crake&#039;s Snowman.  I&#039;m only partway through season two, so I don&#039;t have a fully developed picture of the Pegasus crew yet, but so far they really reinforce just how likeable the other humans are.  They serve as a foil for the Galactica crew in multiple ways.  They show just how little the Galactica crew uphold the hierarchical aspect of human nature.  As military establishments go Galactica&#039;s is very relaxed.  They are less robotic, and more human, as D&#039;anna Biers pointed out in her documentary.  The Pegasus crew&#039;s disturbing nonchalance toward the abuse of the 6 aboard their ship also shows just how little the Galactica crew members give in to typical military machismo.&lt;br /&gt;
	It also seems that the humans can be taught acceptance and understanding.  For all the 6&#039;s claim that Gaius isn&#039;t really a (human) man until he has killed, the trend in the show is more toward acceptance than destruction.  Helo completely accepts his love for Sharon.  He looks forward to her bearing their hybrid child.  Then in an ultimate act of loyalty, he and the chief kill for her.  Even Gaius honestly seems to love his 6.  Though admittedly most of his professions of love stem ultimately from his ongoing instinct for self-preservation rather than an expression of any conscious feeling, he&#039;s on the verge of tears when he sees her in pain aboard the Pegasus.  The people who do mistreat the Cylons are the &quot;bad&quot; humans: Case, Thorne, the crew members of the Pegasus.&lt;br /&gt;
	Though the humans in BSG are clearly not in the midst of a utopian society, the series seems to present the idea that if given a second chance, they might be able to establish a functional relatively accepting society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Just watched the Miniseries</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/365</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished the Battlestar Galactica miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I am extremely sad I hadn&#039;t found this show earlier, as I would have been watching it the whole time.  It really is a great science fiction epic.  The little touches make it seem far more real than straight space westerns do.  There is less sound in space than in other parts of the show, which is gotten wrong by almost every space media.  However, there is still some sound, which I see as a nod to the fact that without it the show would be boring.  The ships seem more realistic than the regular star fighters in most shows.  While they do still have shapes that seem better suited for air than space, they at least have jets on every side of them so that they can maneuver more easily and correctly in space.  Battlestar has so far been far better at showing inertia in space, and not making ships stop instantly whenever they want to or their engines fail.  The situation where the mark VII vipers lost power against the cylons was great because of that fact, that the ships kept moving forward even after their engines stopped.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts of Battlestar that I really liked were the flaws in so many characters.  While it seems requisite to include flaws in your characters, Battlestar has so far seemed to create realistic ones.  Adama isn&#039;t perfect, but he listens to reason.  He drove his son away with his high expectations, but he is willing to make amends.  Roslin is an extremely interesting character.  She has steel in her that seems out of place, until you realize that it comes from her cancer.  She knows she will die, so she is free to make difficult decisions, especially the one where she abandons the sub light craft to make sure the FTL craft can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starbuck reminded me greatly of Tank Girl.  Their personalities seemed very similar, especially when Starbuck was fighting and flying.  Anyone else get that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I trail off a little towards the end, but I want to watch more Battlestar, so more thoughts in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Problems with race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/364</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, the representations of gender in the show are pretty sophisticated, I was impressed in that respect.  I&#039;m much less impressed with their treatment of race.  In particular, why are all the most religious characters black?  I&#039;m delving a little into the beginning of season two here, but there&#039;s Roslin&#039;s (spiritual?) adviser (the one who realizes the importance of the 12 serpents),  her guard in the brig, and the quorum member from Gemenon.  It makes me a little uncomfortable...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Battlestar</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/361</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gawker, the king blog for sarcastic, jaded 20-somethings, adores Battlestar Galactica in a way I thought impossible for a bunch of bloggers so mired in their own ironic-ness.  Anyway, their recaps of its goings-on are hilarious, or at least I think they are hilarious.  If anyone is interested:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Military Question</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/359</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a embarrassing revealing of my lack of knowledge on the workings of the military, but does our military use &quot;sir&quot; to address women in command?  Or is that a convention invented for the show?&lt;/p&gt;
