 <title>Parallel &quot;realities&quot; make for some interesting experiences...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/274</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Snow Crash takes a very interesting approach to the future...namely, an evolution of what we&#039;d consider the internet.  However, this web of information is more than just a bunch of pages to look at...its a whole new reality whatsoever, with people interacting, sharing, and doing stuff almost as if it is the real world....with some modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the setup of the Street and The Black Sun bar that Hiro frequents.  The Street itself is basically a hub...information and people gather in great amounts there, and they filter off/leave for sub-streets for various reasons.  The metaphor here of streets implies a distinct parallel to the real world...in fact, could even be called a reality of its own with city streets, and a central &quot;main&quot; street where lots of people gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black Sun is a sorta-typical bar, with the difference being that some of the best hackers in the world hang out there, along with several other important figures.  In a way, it is a parallel to some sort of exclusive night club or bar, and that fact that such a things exists (and has drinks of its own) shows the extent by which this alternate universe has developed.  If you think about it, why would there be a need for drinking where information is exchanged and presented? (and drugs for that matter, like Snow Crash itself).  Our current internet does that decently enough as is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its the differences from reality that kinda make me realize why such unnecessary things exist.  The fact that Hiro wrote the algorithms for sword-fighting....and even DEATH by such combat...shows the level of control hackers like Hiro have over the &quot;reality&quot; of the Metaverse.  In essence, the Metaverse serves as a new world of its own...tailored to the needs and wants of its people to a larger degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me a bit towards some of our discussion in class, primarily Second Life.  This program was brought up because it draws its inspiration from the novel and tries to mimic such an environment.  Out of curiosity, I decided to try a free account just to see what it was about and how close it came/comes to realizing the picture Snow Crash portrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of exploration and messing around, I found it to be quite an experience.  The similarities and parallels to the Metaverse in Snow Crash are quite astounding, and the possibilities look endless.  Perhaps our future might end up this way, as the technology is already there to a degree (and developing).  Granted, something like Second Life would take ages to get to that point....but I&#039;m somewhat thrilled by the thought that it might happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Associations</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/270</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Power plays a very significant role in Snow Crash.  With the fall of government, life has become radically unstable, with radically different expectations in terms of justice.  Individual security no longer holds the significance that we are used to.  The only way for an individual to ensure that violations of personal interests won&#039;t go unpunished is to tie those interests with the interests of a group, which means, in effect, to become a part of a franchise.  This truth is expressed repeatedly in the book by both Y.T. and Hiro and the way they manage their individualism.  The book first hints at this fact when discussing Hiro&#039;s employment choices.  Hiro prefers to remain a freelance hacker, but  apparently &quot;now, that&#039;s no longer possible, [because] software comes out of factories, and hackers are [] assembly-line workers.&quot; (39)  While the primary purpose of this passage is to describe the majority of the hacking profession, it clearly implies that there is no place for individual work, because organizations out-compete individual hackers.  However, Y.T. provides the best example of how association with a group is a form of protection.  When she&#039;s kidnapped, her connection to the RadiKS company allows her to escape.  Her membership in that group grants her the protection of that group, and ultimately, she&#039;s able to rouse a minor trasher army to take down the helicopter that she&#039;s in.  This sort of street justice only protects those that are associated, and it seems that the more powerful your associates are, the better your protection will be.  However, this protection has limits.  When Y.T. is apprehended by Metacops after delivering Hiro&#039;s pizza, she reminds them that &quot;I work for RadiKS.  We protect our own,&quot; but the cops respond &quot;Not tonight you don&#039;t.  Tonight you took a pizza from a scene of a car wreck.  Left the scene of an accident.  RadiKS tell you to deliver that pizza?&quot; (52)  She doesn&#039;t dispute this, because she realizes that RadiKS won&#039;t protect her if she strays outside their &#039;jurisdiction&#039;.  This reveals that, while the associations which people attach themselves to do provide some safety for the individual, but individual justice is nonexistent, since these franchulates/companies/sovereign nations are really only concerned with the integrity of the group as a whole.  Ultimately, this dynamic shows that the individual is only granted power through connections to other people, and adherence to the norms those people have agreed upon.  At least, this is what the system seems to be in the beginning of the book.&lt;br /&gt;
	As the book progresses, the power of the individual becomes more and more pronounced.  Raven seems like one of the primary catalysts for this change in perspective.  Raven, as an Aleut, is already predisposed to reject any association with any group.  His family and tribe history isolates him from anyone else, because his tribe had been isolated and disregarded by the rest of the world, to the extent that their own government tested nuclear weapons on them.  The resulting compulsion to vendetta, and quest to nuke America bars him from integrating into this culture.  However, Raven does more than resist integration.  From the first time Raven appears, it seems like he transcends the standard.  Hiro notices Raven in the crowd outside the Black Sun initially, because he stands much taller than everyone else.  Though, Raven manages to stand out in more ways than just his height.  When he makes his appearance at the concert, he transcends local gang politics, all on his own.  While it is arguable that the rules don&#039;t apply to him, simply because he&#039;s the most dangerous mother with a glass knife, and he&#039;s got an H-Bomb rigged to his brain, it seems to me that his power comes from something less tangible.  His ability to ride the waves seems like his real source of power.  This applies physically to his ability to use waves to travel long distances in kayak, but it also applies more generally to see the forces that are naturally present, and hitch a ride, as he did with the Orthos.  This sort of ability to ride these waves shows that he is able to manipulate existent forces to make groups work for him, instead of him working for a group.  I think his introduction into the story opens up new modes of functioning, which Hiro and Y.T. explore.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Personal vs. social responsibility</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/265</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that the most interestig part of Snow Crash was Stephenson&#039;s ideas about what would take the place of government in a lawless society. The Mafia is the most obvious example of this. An organization that has always had to hide to some extent in our society is right out in the open in this futuristic America, and what is more, it seems to be one of the most enlightened ruling groups around. For example, when Jason mistakenly hand-delivers his package to Uncle Enzo, the contrast between the Mafia-controlled block and the ones held by Narcolombians are emphasized. On the Mafia block, &quot;Old ladies are walking the streets again. Children are waiting for schoolbuses and playing hopscotch on sidewalks that recently were stained with blood.&quot; (144) In contrast, when Jason is driving through the Narcolombian neighborhoods of Compton, he is constantly being shot at. Essentially, the Mafia has become a symbol of order, rather than one of lawlessness.&lt;br /&gt;
      The development of the Mafia in this way is actually fairly reasonable when one looks at the values that seem to have come to be respected in this new America. The story of the nearly late pizza early on in the book is a good example. Hiro feels completely justified taking absurd, impossible risks - to deliver a pizza on time. Of course, what is at stake is not the price of the pizza, but credibility. In a world with little or no legal accountability, the importance of personal accountability is magnified. A delivery company that promises to deliver in 30 minutes has to hold itself accountable, because the customers know that there is no one else with the power to do so. Paradoxically, because reneging on a contract has few legal ramifications, it becomes unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;
     This idea of personal or organizational as oppose to social responsibility and loyalty shows up in other places as well. For example, when Y.T. is caught by the MetaCops, she calls her boyfriend Roadkill for help: &quot;&#039;you&#039;re my boyfriend,&#039; she says, speaking very simply and plainly. &#039;If I get popped, you&#039;re supposed to come around and help bust me out.&#039; Isn&#039;t everyone supposed to know this stuff? Don&#039;t parents teach their kids anything anymore?&quot; (78) To Y.T., it is completely obvious that part of being a boyfriend is helping get one&#039;s girlfriend away form the cops. It doesn&#039;t seem like she&#039;s even really making a request here. She&#039;s not saying, &quot;please help me.&quot; Instead, she&#039;s pointing out Roadkill&#039;s personal responsiblity to her, a responsibility that she sees as binding. Again, personal responsiblity seems to take the role that leal or social responsiblity takes in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
