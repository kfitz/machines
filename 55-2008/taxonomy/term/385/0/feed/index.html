 <title>Am I the only one...?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/366</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one in class who does not like BSG? I have made it through the miniseries and first half of the first season and just can&#039;t seem to feel any interest in the happenings of the show or the lives of the characters. Frankly, I don&#039;t really care what happens and find it all rather boring. Perhaps I am just shallow, but there is something about the whole political-drama-in-space thing that really puts me off when it comes to SF TV and movies. I&#039;ve always liked comedic stuff with lots of space battles and explosions!!!  Action-adventurey shows I supposeâ€¦ Indiana Jones in space! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&#039;t have any particular reason for this weird double-standard about SF TV (which I didn&#039;t even realize I had until trying to watch BSG). I&#039;m sure I am now going to be eaten alive for not appreciating this and that and all the intricacies of the show and whatnot, but I don&#039;t think I am going to be getting over this double-standard anytime soon.  So I was just curious as to if there is anyone else who isn&#039;t enjoying BSG thus far and if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
