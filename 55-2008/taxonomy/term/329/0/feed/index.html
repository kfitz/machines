 <title>Midnight Robber finds another frontier</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/297</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nalo Hopkinson, (though a web search reveals her to be a relative new author), seems to have made her unique mark on Science Fiction largely because that voice is grounded in the rhythms, myths, and vernacular of Caribbean and Creole cultures.  I mean, she is clearly not the only Science Fiction author to bring a recognizable contemporary culture other than American-flavored Caucasian to the SciFi stage, but let&#039;s face it:  Name another SciFi writer of African heritage besides Delaney and Butler.  Now remember the languages they used in Stars and Lilith: they were quite different from Hopkinson, dense in a style we associate with Western academic and avant-garde discourse (in the case of Delaney) or somewhat removed as per the Western scientific approach (so that&#039;s a little too simple to describe Butler, but you get the idea).   Admittedly, though we may feel that the use of dialects is a sort of &quot;gimmick&quot; we&#039;ve seen before, I think it&#039;s important to note the way in which the sheer immersion in and weaving of dialects and textual/cultural artifacts makes Science Fiction new for us again in this novel, and starts to blend the realms of media produced to raise cultural awareness (I&#039;m thinking here of the tradition of avant-garde African-American and Caribbean documentary filmmaking, of which The Last Angel of History seems to stand as a good example, though it&#039;s apparently British?) and the &quot;pop&quot; genere of Science fiction.  *** I&#039;m so excited!  I&#039;m an odd fan of African-American and Afro-Cribbean documentary and art cinema (says the sheltered young white college student from Idaho) for its honesty, depth, feeling, power, and occasional bluntness.  To see some of these tendencies leak out and start shaping a wad of Sci Fi, one of my favorite literary genres, isâ€¦well, exciting.***  Seriously people.  Midnight Robber struck me as taking us deeper, making newness inevitable on a linguistic and cultural front by forcing us to explore new worlds in more than one sense.  Importantly, I think we should note that by using that dialect not only for the characters, but at times for the narration itself, Hopkinson is stepping beyond a boundary many writers have opted not to cross.  She&#039;s written bridging sections entirely in Creole, framing the main story with legends and background information, slipping Caribbean vocabulary and rhythms into her narration.&lt;br /&gt;
	What&#039;s most impressive to me  is how she controls her use of dialect. While the characters speak a consistent patois, the dialect ebbs and flows in Hopkinson&#039;s expository writing. By carefully varying whether each sentence is in standard English, Creole or a combination of the two languages, she shifts elegantly from simple events to emotional viewpoints, highlighting action or slowing other scenes down.  There is power in bridging cultures, and a unique viewpoint that can only be achieved by straddling cultural chasms.  However, Hopkinson&#039;s use of Caribbean myth extends beyond mere language. The space-age legends she has created provide clues about the history of the Toussaint colony and explain the sometimes unusual attitudes and actions of the characters. This subtle approach seems pretty common in science fiction, but we readers are still forced to work out the meanings of each legend for ourselves before we can connect the stories back to the colony&#039;s present-day life. It&#039;s extra detective work, but it&#039;s fun.  YES FUN.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ultimate Tree House People</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/295</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon reading a science fiction book that creates a new sentient species, it is always interesting to consider how that species differs from humans, as the departure from a human model is a commentary on how the author views humankind.  Specifically, it usually points out the perceived flaws in human interactions, politics, overall behavior, and response to environment.  In creating the douen as a sentient race, which were already a well-established myth in Caribbean culture (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&quot; title=&quot;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&quot;&gt;http://hometown.aol.com/lafillette/Spooks/laf10.htm&lt;/a&gt;), Hopkinson continued her pattern of using folk lore and mythical characters as main players in her book, but redefined, showing the myths as extrapolated from a more science fiction type truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was touched on somewhat briefly in class on Monday, the treatment of the Douen by the exiled Toussaint humans echoed the African slave experience and illuminated the way in which humans manage to come up with irrational validation to treat others as sub-human.  Little Tan-Tan was so surprised at the use of &quot;master&quot; towards the humans, when Chichibud says it, because she sees Chichibud as just another kind of person.  She had not yet learned the human tendency to equate difference with inferiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about the douen that was interesting was the drastic difference between male and female within the species.  In superficially examining this difference, Hopkinson&#039;s purpose is unclear (at least to me).  As a species the distinctions are very useful because the humans do not expect such a deviation based on gender within a species, since it is difficult to think of a single species on Earth that varies that much within itself based on sex.  Also, from a practical perspective, the ability to use them as pack animal, transportation, protection, sonic weapon, radar, and manufacturer of trade goods, is indispensable.  It can be supposed that from a biological perspective the split of male as reptilian and female as bird is not completely removed from the realm of possibility, considering the study of dinosaurs being closely related to reptiles and birds.  There is a magical component in the douen culture, even though Chichibud&#039;s initial claims of magic turn out to have been stories for the young Tan-Tan.  There was the medicine, which is so much more affective than the medicine the Toussaint people used.  The daddy tree was also somewhat magical, providing for virtually all of the needs of the douen people in a perfectly symbiotic relationship.  Specifically the absence of technology in the douen culture makes them seem more magical, as other alien species are traditionally reliant on technological advancement for their super human abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of existing myths to build a species must have made Hopkinson&#039;s job somewhat easier, but they do depart drastically from the original lore.  However, the use of folk lore enriched her creations and her story by creating a many layered mythology within the book&#039;s fiction that seems to become deeper the more one knows about Caribbean culture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s with Antonio?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/290</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I take issue with Nalo Hopkinson&#039;s portrayal of love in Midnight robber.  In particular, I object to the way that the story of Antonio plays out.  I acknowledge that he was always a clearly flawed character, but I didn&#039;t see him as someone who was beyond saving in the beginning of the book.  In fact, I saw him as a uniquely empathetic character, in that he clearly loved his daughter.  He may have been a sinister mayor, with a desire to keep secrets from Nanny and the public, but in the beginning, it seems like he is not all selfishness.  When we first meet her, Antonio reveals his inner tenderness for Tan-Tan, &quot;his doux-doux darling girl, his one pureness.&quot; (13) He adores her so much that, &quot;he was forever going to watch at her sleeping in her bassinet.&quot; (13)  Clearly, there is something unique about Antonio&#039;s relationship with Tan-Tan.  The love he shows to Tan-Tan is possibly only paralleled by the love that Tan-Tan shows him in the beginning.  When I read this description of Antonio&#039;s adoration, I immediately categorized him as someone to root for.  My reasoning was as follows.  He loves Tan-Tan in what seems to be a purely selfless way, so he must care for more than just himself.  If he cares for one person more than himself, he must be capable of caring for others.  I had thought that his love for his daughter revealed that Antonio was a truly caring person.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially, when contrasted with Antonio&#039;s relationship with Ione, I thought Antonio&#039;s relationship with Tan-Tan would be a saving grace.  Before they had a baby together, Ione&#039;s and Antonio&#039;s lives were ruled by passion.  Their pursuit of &quot;love so sweet it hot&quot; led them to repeatedly cheat on each other. (45)  They apparently saw this dynamic, where they were constantly quarrelling over the each other&#039;s lovers, as a game, which somehow kept their sexual life interesting, and provide for passionate reunions.  To me, this sort of behavior seems completely hedonistic and self-serving.  Yet, once they have the Tan-Tan, Antonio seems to experience an almost tangible shift in priorities.  Ione continued with her series of other lovers, but the romantic turbulence doesn&#039;t seem like it was a prominent factor in their lives until we reach the where the story starts off.  I had thought this series of events indicated that the entrance of Tan-Tan into Antonio&#039;s life had redirected him away from an entirely selfish mode of functioning.  It seemed to me that Hopkinson portrayed passion as a destructive force, but that the entrance of Tan-Tan into the story stifled the cycle of passion by introducing love into the equation.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, all my notions about Antonio were steadily shattered.  It starts when it is revealed that he used poison in the machete battle.  From there, the situation deteriorates.  It becomes clear that Antonio is still the same self centered man, and Tan-Tan&#039;s attachment to him becomes painful.  He leaves her outside the bedroom while he and Ione fuck, right before he is sent to his holding cell. Clearly, his passion overwhelmed the love that we were seeing earlier in the book.  How could he want his last act as a citizen of Toissant to be to fuck his wife, rather than see his daughter?  It tore at me more than I would have expected.  From then on, desire, not love seems to be his driving motivation.  He took Tan-Tan with him half-way tree, seemingly out of desperation, rather than any care for her.  And ultimately, this desire goes completely out of control, and he rapes his daughter, expressing, what I once would have considered love, as pure primal passion.&lt;br /&gt;
To summarize, I see this chain of events as a way to befoul fatherly love.  I can&#039;t imagine how the feelings he felt for his daughter in the beginning could be conveyed as anything more sinister than any other father&#039;s feelings.  By the development, it seems to me that Nalo Hopkinson is saying that this love really is rooted in passion, and therefore that love is truly as destructive as passion.&lt;/p&gt;
