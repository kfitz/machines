 <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly&#039;s long nails: In class on Monday when we discussed Molly, there was a comment made that long nails in America have this stigma of impracticality, and that Molly&#039;s nails are useful.  When I thought about her nails, especially in relation to Asian culture, I pictured instead those sharp metal nails (I wish I knew what they were called) that Chinese women used to wear on their fingers.  They were typically worn on the pinkie and ring fingers, and while I do not know what they were used for (ornamentation, probably), in Chinese shows or movies, sometimes an angry aristocratic woman will use them to viciously scratch someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I thought it was really interesting that Molly had surgery on her eyes.  I don&#039;t know if this was common back when Gibson wrote Neuromancer, but nowadays, surgery is not uncommon among Asian women (Japanese, Koreans and Chinese).  Many undergo plastic surgery to get larger &quot;double eyelids&quot; (an effort to assimilate with Western culture...?  Japanese magazines even have tips on how to apply makeup so that Asian eyes will look more like Caucasian ones).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Who else thinks Molly is a J.A.M.F.?&lt;/p&gt;
