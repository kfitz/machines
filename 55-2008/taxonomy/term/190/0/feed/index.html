 <title>Post-Humanism, Part One: Experiences in the Class Thus Far</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/189</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me about several of the novels we&#039;ve read thus far is that their speculation is based on human biology; specifically, the attempt to alter and control it. In the past I came across a word for this; post-humanism, a nebulous and ill-defined term, but one ultimately centered around the concept of building better humans. There have been aspects of this in most of the books we&#039;ve read, such as...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Starship Troopers: The soldiers rely even more on science than any in our history. The M-I are not so much foot soldiers as pilots for their suits, the equivalent of a second skin that enhances their durability and movement. The suits are much more personal than any conventional military vehicle, to the point where they move based on feedback from the pilot&#039;s body motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Neuromancer: Practically everyone is altered in some way; Case is described as a wasted human body whose utility is based primarily on his digital self. Molly takes a physical role, but she&#039;s full of various machines, such as her claws and her eyes. And there are characters like Wintermute and Neuromancer who act sentient, but that are hard to classify as human because they lack any biological components. Artificial intelligence, but hardly robotic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- The Handmaid&#039;s Tale and The Left Hand of Darkness: Much harder to classify as post-human, because they&#039;re more about the examination of sexual relationships than scientific ones; not mutually exclusive, but generally these books are more about exploring biology as it is than what it could be. Still, the characters are altered in various ways; the Handmaid&#039;s Tale shows an attempt to control reproduction ( more socially than scientifically ), and The Left Hand of Darkness has the hemaphrodite characters use drugs to accelerate/stunt their &quot; kemmer &quot; period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Lilith&#039;s Brood: Probably the most post-human focused of all the books we&#039;ve read, because it not only has humans being altered by alien technology, but the results of that alteration across the generations. The Oankali, with their biological machines, attach new genes that change the human body. Not just in terms of healing the sick, but strengthening the basic human structure; Lilith is the best example, as she gains enhanced strength, regenerative powers, the ability to interface with the walls of the ship, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand: I&#039;m still working through this book as of this post, but the fact that &quot; rats &quot; ( humans altered to have enhanced capabilites and removed free will ) play so heavily into it suggests that similar ideas will come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these patterns is quite interesting; I&#039;ll have more comments on the post-human connections later...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>brain flashes on butler</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/178</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;K, first off, &quot;Bloodchild&quot; = creepy and not to be read right before going to bed, especially if one is particularly phobic about personal invasion by insects to begin with.  Personal nausea aside, though, the contrast between assimilating a species into one&#039;s own, and using the Other as purely breeding ground is fascinating.  &quot;Bloodchild&quot; made &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot; sit far more easily with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooloi--when I first saw the word, it looked very familiar, but I&#039;ve never read anything by Butler before, and poking around on the web, she&#039;s the only one who&#039;s meant to use the word.  It&#039;s not the pronunciation of the word that&#039;s familiar, it&#039;s the physical shape of it.  Can anyone shed any light on this?  It&#039;s driving me bonkers.  The OED offers a fascinating array of words that start with oo (a prefix which means having to do with eggs or ova, yay butler making up intelligent names!), but nothing looks familiar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that &quot;Lilith&#039;s Brood&quot; is also referred to often as the Xenogenesis Trilogy.  Lilith&#039;s Brood is a far bleaker title.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith&#039;s myth-based history is fascinating.  Yay for &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/161&quot;&gt;Scott_of_the_Sahara&#039;s post on it.&lt;/a&gt;  My first introduction to Lilith was through Neil Gaiman&#039;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series, where he highlights Lilith&#039;s refusal to be sexually dominated by Adam, a motif that comes up again in a play that was put on here fall of 2004, &quot;The Lovesong of J Robert Oppenheimer.&quot;  The focus on sex that comes up with her, both in the above mentioned and in Scott_of_the_Sahara&#039;s post, with the seduction of men and the wantonness of spawning a demon race, is an interesting backdrop to the trilogy we just read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a comic series, &quot;Lucifer Morningstar,&quot; that&#039;s a spin-off of Sandman that I also kept thinking of during Lilith&#039;s Brood.  In it, the Lilim, her demon children, are one of three sides in the armageddon battle.  The three sides of a story instead of the traditional two plays out rather interestingly.  The series also deals a lot with the creation of new worlds and species and the responsibility that comes with creation and manipulation and birth.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Cohesison in Lilith&#039;s Brood: Dawn</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/154</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Not really a criticism of Butler&#039;s work, but an observation I&#039;ve been mulling over for a while...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I&#039;ve finished Dawn and am working through Adulthood Rites. Like most of you, I&#039;m doing so through the format of the Lilith&#039;s Brood omnibus edition that collects all three novels. But reading this all consecutively offers a different experience than what one would get by reading the novels individually; for instance, reading Dawn on its own and getting to Adulthood Rites later. And I&#039;m very curious what impression one would get from reading the three novels as individual entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audience raised on pop culture and genre fiction generally expects narrative cohesion; that everything get resolved, or at least have a clean break from one unit in the series to the next. Though the universe&#039;s story is not completely settled, the individual plot threads of the novel are usually tied up to the point where the conclusion at least feels satisfying. Consider recent examples like the TV show House ( though House is still messed up, the medical mystery of the episode is solved, and the patient in question goes off into the sunset ), the Harry Potter novels ( each book chronicles one school year, a clear start and end to that book&#039;s adventure ), and distinct story arcs in comic books that are later collected in complete trade paperbacks ( though the overarching story of a series like Preacher or Y the Last Man continues, each collection offers a complete narrative ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn, however, followed an opposite trend. The ending of Dawn does offer a significant change-- Nikanji impregnating Lilith with the dead Joseph&#039;s DNA-- but it&#039;s really just a continuation of the larger problem that Lilith faces. Since her awakening, the Oankali have been meddling in her affairs to a ridiculous extent, using their seeming omniscence to determine what&#039;s best for her, only answering her questions when they want to, and altogether robbing her of the ability to choose her own fate. Lilith is obviously ambivalent to this, as any sane person would be, but the aliens don&#039;t relent-- they modify her gene structure, they determine what time and place she&#039;ll be,  they throw upon her the responsibility of being the leader to the Awakened humans, etc. And the final scene doesn&#039;t resolve anything, it just confirms the fact that Lilith is the prisoner of these benevolently tyrannical aliens. Just because they sensed that she was alone and wanted a child doesn&#039;t give them the right to put one inside her without asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t a problem when the work is read in one seamless volume, but if I were to read Dawn independently, I&#039;d probably be frustrated; not so much by the cliffhanger ending, but the fact that Lilith has made no progress whatsoever, and is still the Oankali&#039;s puppet. Given what they&#039;ve done to her, almost any good will she may have towards the aliens strikes me as the onset of Stockholm&#039;s Syndrome...&lt;/p&gt;
