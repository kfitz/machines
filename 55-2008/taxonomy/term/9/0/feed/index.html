 <title>Response to Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/45</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Response To Heinlein&#039;s Starship Troopers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always like Sci-Fi.  I don&#039;t know why I did originally, it was just something my mother got out of the library, and I would read it, having no other choice of something to read.  As I got older though, I grew pickier about my sci-fi.  I grew away from Space Westerns, and started liking more &quot;speculative fiction.&quot;  Of course that didn&#039;t mean that I didn&#039;t still enjoy Space Westerns, just that I thought of them more as fluff.  That&#039;s why I enjoy Starship Troopers so much.  Not only is it such a good piece of speculative fiction, specifically with its all volunteer army, power suits, and a voting populace completely consisting of veterans, but it also has a number of scenes that make my inner fan boy squeal with delight.  The first scene about destroying property on the Skinny planet makes for a great read about a &quot;bad ass marine.&quot;  More importantly to our class, was the scene at the end of the Skinny planet on pages 17-20.  While the mobile infantry are taking care of their own, up in the sky, a woman pilot makes extremely difficult computations on the fly and manages to save their retrieval boat, even though it launched late.&lt;br /&gt;
	Situations like this show Heinlein&#039;s respect for women in the context of a world that draws on the 1950s.  Women make the best pilots, Heinlein says.  They have better reflexes and are able to make the snap decisions that lead to becoming good pilots.  Women have a very important role in the novel.  The Mobile Infantry would be nothing without the ships that brought them to their combats, and this is alluded to throughout the novel.  The navy, and the women, are working constantly on the ship, bringing Mobile Infantry men to their battles, where they fight for only the slightest amount of time, at least in comparison with the amount of time they spend on the ship.  There is the argument that the women pilots do not fight, which is essential in a male dominated society to gain respect, but every scene with a female captain involves the mobile infantry paying her the utmost respect.  The Navy also seems to do more than the Army.  While it almost falls under the radar, the story tells about how the Navy takes out far more bugs than the Army with their planet smashing guns.  In fact, the Mobile Infantry seems almost redundant with the weaponry that Heinlein says the Navy has.  The ability to rip a planet into pieces is far more powerful than the specialized surgical strikes that the men of the Mobile Infantry have.  Also, the job is almost as dangerous for the women pilots, as seen when two ships crash and kill all women Navy crew members.  So in conclusion, even though women can be seen as &quot;bus drivers&quot;, which is a relic of the 1950s time period, they are exalted bus drivers, ones that command most of the power.  In his own way, Heinlein gives women more power to women than men.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The difference between an MI man and a bug is...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/44</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m tempted to call this novel nostalgic, for all of its debatable purpose and philosophy.  Of course I wouldn&#039;t be the first to call it so, and part of the reason the jacket calls it &quot;The controversial classic of military adventure&quot; is the long history it has spawned of civilian readers being to some degree upset or suspicious of the almost fond way in which this future society of citizenship through military service is described; but still I had promised myself going in that I was going to try and find Heinlein&#039;s real philosophy behind the novel.  As it turns out, I&#039;m really feeling a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality from the book.  Is that surprising?  I think that even though you have characters like Mr. Dubois espousing the nature of the beauty of war and the enforcing of a moral system through punishment, sometimes Heinlein seems to be bringing out the very humanity he seems to find in such a system.  The first time I really felt this was in the passage, starting on page 80, that describes Rico&#039;s experience overhearing Zim and Frankel discussing their strong feelings of anguish at the punishment they had just ordered for Hendrick, and in the process describing the very reasons they had been forced, out of an absolute loyalty to the system, to act against these feelings.  Rico&#039;s response is his &quot;unsettling feeling that I had been completely mistaken as to the nature of the world I was in.&quot;  This isn&#039;t a passage the describes an undermining of the system, but rather a moment in which the main character experiences a epiphany about the significance and the actual (supposed?) underlying morality behind the value of adherence to a strict system for the good of the whole. Certainly Heinlein&#039;s career in the military (thanks Wikipedia) couldn&#039;t help but have informed this book, and certainly this is something that&#039;s been held against him by some critics.  As a civilian, though, I&#039;m as wary as the rest of you about such a rigid system like the one described by Heinlein (despite the humanity exhibited in private by some characters) in real life practice, and this book (though dated) certainly seems to try and nestle itself closely to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One classmate mentioned something about the tendency of Greek plays to include a character whose only purpose in the play was to expound to the audience about the philosophy the writer has attempted to embody in the play and his reasons for writing it to begin with.  Interesting to see that method popping up again here, in the form of mister (colonel) Dubois.  He doesn&#039;t just have one passage in which he seems to be lecturing not only Rico but the reader, but one of the most memorable surrounds page 118, at which point he begins to discuss mankind&#039;s cultivated &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals.&quot;  This is apparently the theory on which the entire society has been based, a society in which Citizenship (which means more than just suffrage) is awarded to those who voluntarily perform military service, and in which the MI are the most deserving, the most understanding of the morality they are upholding and the honor which they claim because of it.  Everyone, the recruiter, Dubois, Rico, Zim, Ace is proud of the MI legacy and seems to belong to a club of understanding.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet there are the bugs.  They are unafraid of defending themselves, they are willing to sacrifice all in the name of the whole.  In many ways they embody the &quot;noblest fate&quot; described by Dubois, throwing themselves relentlessly into war and in front of their home.  And yet humanity, for all its rigid belief of sacrifice for the whole, does not recognize this. Sure, they&#039;re bugs, but if they were evaluated by the same system as the soldiers evaluate themselves, wouldn&#039;t their be something that would have to be said for bug morality and bug civilization?  Dubois mentions in passing that humanity is &quot;even developing an exact method for extra-human relations.&quot; (118)  Because humanity&#039;s method for inter-human relations is restricted to humans.  Yes, here I can see it: the potential for problematic reading of Heinlein&#039;s universe as one in which different systems of evaluation for different beings goes unquestioned.  How different to the beings have to be before they lose a place in the human system?  The &quot;Skinnies&quot; aren&#039;t anything like the bugs.  And yet humanity has put them in the same moral place: far away from itself.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>military and fascism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/43</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Starship Troopers is on the reading list for four of the five military academies is certainly not surprising.  The book is the story of a man who finds enlightenment through his progression in the military.  Johnny discovers that one must make personal sacrifices in order to be a citizen.  It is a privilege that one must be willing to die for.  With that said, I find it difficult to recognize any true change in the character of Johnny.  Yes, he is wiser in the military trade and can regurgitate what he has been told to be true.  But Johnny remains little more than a soldier.  He describes his experiences in boot camp and later in the Officer Candidate School and yet I don&#039;t feel as though the reader truly ever knows Johnny.  I realize Heinlin was not hoping for the reader to form a personal connection to Johnny but I did find the story cold and eerily void of emotions.  There was no time to make meaningful connections or discoveries â€“ there was no time for the individual.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the book makes great effort in marking an anti-communist stand, I did find many aspects of the society to have a fascist ring.  There was not an obvious superior race or religion among the humans â€“ countries joined together to defend their planet.  But humans did claim greatness over the Bugs and Skinnies.  The inhabitants of planet Earth believed themselves to be a more deserving species than any other planet&#039;s species.  I do not support the proposal that the novel is racist but the sentiment that humans are the superior species is clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s fascist underpinning displays itself within the classroom discussions, especially within the views of Mr. Dubois.  Calling Marx a &quot;pompous fraud,&quot; Dubois says, &quot;The Marxian definition of value is ridiculous.  All the work one cares to add will not turn a mud pie into an apple tart; it remains a mud pie, value zero&quot; (92).  One must not follow the rules of Marxism, what Heinlein would most likely refer to as idealistic.  In order for a society to advance, one must depend on the military and with that violence.  People in the military cannot consider their individual needs; they have to fight only for the progression of their platoon.  This is obviously a standard ethic of military services but it is also fascist on a grander scale.  A fascist society must function as a united front.  A human&#039;s needs must equate to the needs of his or her country.  The fact that only veterans can participate in elections speaks to my belief that Heinlein&#039;s utopian society would be one ruled by military and fascism.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>observations on the status of women</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/42</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I ended up coming to this text from a general feminist perspective, since the dominant voices in the story are obviously male, and women are only seen in scattered instances, both inside and outside the military system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Heinlein doesn&#039;t seem to hold the view on women that I expected him to express, which was of the &quot;all women are objects, good for nothing but cooking, cleaning and sex&quot; variety. Well, at least he doesn&#039;t hold it to an absolute extreme. Starship Troopers was first published in 1959, just before the sexual (and political) revolution of the 1960s; the ideal feminine image was likely still that of the happy homemaker.&lt;br /&gt;
There are some scenes that do support this misogynistic view of women. For example, on page 27, Johnnie and his friend Carl run into another friend of theirs, Carmencita Ibanez, on the way to the military recruiters&#039; office. She announces that she is signing up to become a pilot, and Johnnie remarks to himself: &quot;Fact was, little Carmen was so ornamental that you just never thought about her being useful.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are also treated as a form of visual entertainment, as Johnnie describes on pages 125-126: &quot;I stood around and gawked...at girls. I hadn&#039;t realized how wonderful they were. Look, I&#039;d approved of girls from the time I&#039;d first noticed that the difference was more than that they dressed differently.&quot; Oh, okay; so as soon as the girls became sexually fascinating it was easier to &#039;approve&#039; of them? Do they need that &#039;approval&#039; in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Military women seem to be a partial exception to this view. It is acknowledged in several instances that women make the sharpest and most creative pilots, such as Captain Deladrier, who is clearly in a position of some authority over the men on her ship. She is ultimately responsible for the success of their missions at the beginning and the end. When Johnnie notices that Carmen has shaved her head for the Navy, he expresses a deeper respect for her: &quot;It does serve to set a Navy girl apart from civilian chicks; sort of a lodge pin, like the gold skulls for combat drops. It made Carmen look distinguished, gave her dignity, and for the first time I finally realized that she was an officer and a fighting man---as well as a very pretty girl.&quot; Of course, this also implies that the only way that women can obtain some dignity is through military service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this is something I wanted to open up to discussion. Are the views of women expressed in this book predictable and in line with the military perspective? Does Heinlein seem to be emphasizing the inferiority of women? or merely subjugating all his characters to the mighty military machine that he praises so much? Etc?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Individualizing Civilians within the Federation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/40</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While the bugs are all kinds of huge in the movie, I was surprised at how little they actually figured in the book.  The entire book I kept waiting for the epic bug fights, as my previous introduction to the story had been through the second half of the movie.  A third of the way through the book, Rico gets out of boot camp.  The bugs aren&#039;t even mentioned until the halfway point.  For all that there is commentary about the evil commie hive-mind bugs, I found that they had virtually no importance in the novel.  The book never truly ends, and the bug war certainly doesn&#039;t.  Rico has had time to make it to Lieutenant, and it&#039;s still the same war against the same enemy with heated combat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federation strikes me much more as a war industry than a political force.  It doesn&#039;t matter who the enemy is, it just matters that there is an enemy, and that it is very different from humanity.  At this point, there is an implication that the entire world and its numerous extra-planetary colonies are all under one government, one nation.  Yet throughout the text, you have these small moments of the acknowledgement that earthly nationalities still exist, almost subversively.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rico&#039;s father rails against Rico joining the Federal Service, his comment of Mr. Dubois is &quot;Hmmph, a silly name--it suits him.  Foreigner, no doubt&quot; (23).  Throughout the text, there is the implication that there is but one government, one nation, under the Federation, and one official language, English.  How there can be a foreigner, then, if this is truly the system, is quite the puzzlement.  Given that the military is the one that clumped the entire world together, and has since maintained order with an iron fist, it seems logical that civilians have not had the sense of home and tradition and personal heritage taken away from them because they still have an individuality that implies a personal history.  This individuality is stripped away from those who enter service with the Federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Service, though, has some sense of national heritage, as is seen with the band that plays on marches.  Rico always talks about the origin of the music when he talks about the band, be it the Scottish bagpipes that somehow grew on him, or French revolutionary nationalistic songs like Marseilles (94).*  There are also many ethnically specific, or at least evocative, names throughout the text, which creates a small attempt by civilians to maintain personal pride and heritage.  Juan becomes Johnnie, though, showing how the military environment, with its Standard English, further seeks to strip away personal identifiers and pride in and loyalty to something other than the Federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a strong sense of a division between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres throughout the book.  At boot camp, Zim adopts a completely different persona when fighting Shujumi.  There is a strange highlight on the art of the martial art, with a step away from the martial.  Attaching on to this, Heinlein creates a history, written during the Cold War, in which the &quot;Russo-Anglo-American Alliance and the Chinese Hegemony&quot; (113) are the two sides in the final war before all the world&#039;s government and law-enforcement systems break down, sometime in the late XXth century.**  What I found most striking here was that Heinlein rearranged the alliances of the Cold War, putting bitter enemies together, mixing communism and democracy.  Perhaps Heinlein was attempting to subtlety underscore his belief that neither system worked well enough.  What struck me most about this, though, was the construct of the East versus the West.  While both sides fall to shambles, the West ultimately wins, in that it is in Scotland that the Federation first begins to form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know exactly what Heinlein is trying to do with this.  The best I can come to making sense of this is through the scene with martial arts.  Yes, Rico mentions later that Shujumi serves as the group&#039;s martial arts instructor, but there is never again a point when it is explicitly used.  Zim learned from Shujumi&#039;s father, whom Shujumi also trained under.  Zim wins the fight.  Is the message, then, that only when you have consumed all the cultures around you, form their fighting styles to their music, can you truly &quot;win&quot; at anything?  The Federation maintains power by being the only governing body in the world, quite literally.  To do so, they have had to consume all of the world&#039;s cultures.  Is, then, part of the failure in the war against the bugs a result of their inability to learn from the bugs?  Rico mentions that the brain bugs, though captured, prove to be of little use, as they die so quickly after capture.  Or is this lack of understanding of the bugs, the inability to communicate or compromise, and the resulting war necessary for the continuation of the Federation, and thus in some way propagated by the Federation?  I&#039;m not suggesting some crazy paranoid conspiracy plan, but what I am suggesting is that Heinlein&#039;s stance in this book is that war is a human necessity, and that the lesser of the evils, that which is better for the group, is to fight against that which you cannot understand, rather than fight amongst those who you choose not to understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Interesting tidbit!  Apparently banned at various points in French history and has words like citizen running amok in it.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/marseill.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Perhaps XX instead of 20 is meant to indicate that we are so far in the future that Arabic numeral fail us, we need the oh-so-classy, complex Roman numerals for that might that is the World?  Or maybe it&#039;s meant to harken back to the Roman Empire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***Completely unrelated, but stuff I thought was fascinating: the bugs in the text are never given much size definition, but the queens are thought to be the size of large horses, which seems inconceivable to Rico, so presumably they&#039;re meant to be rather smaller than those awesome goo-filled guys in the movie.  This seems important, but I haven&#039;t fully sorted out for myself just why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****Other thought--Rico refers to Zim as an &quot;invincible robot&quot; (85), the MIs are forever being called apes, and &quot;[Sergeants] don&#039;t have mothers. [â€¦]  They reproduce by fissionâ€¦like all bacteria&quot; (50).  These MIs sure spend a lot of time not being human, then don exoskeletons to go fight intelligent bugsâ€¦   Something&#039;s up hereâ€¦  Alas, it is also 2am.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Truth, science and religion in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/39</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m a bit science and religion obsessed academically, but I think the discussion here could be fruitful. This really goes back to the class discussion about the &quot;scientifically verifiable theory of morals&quot; (p. 118). I think Riceguy20 is totally right to highlight  the quote &quot;Man has no moral instinct&quot; (p. 117) as really important -- through the instrument of Mr. Dubois, Heinlein constructs the ultimate &#039;science trumps religion&#039; universe. My interest derives also from Asimov&#039;s &quot;Foundation&quot;, in which a branch of mathematics called &quot;psychohistory&quot; develops that governs nearly every part of life (to certain scale/degree).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our present-day world, writers like Edward Wilson might suggest a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/98apr/biomoral.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
biological basis for morality&lt;/a&gt;, but even so we&#039;re still one step shy of explaining all subjects with symbolic logic. Repeatedly, such logic is the ultimate appeal in Starship Troopers. Assignments like &quot;Bring to class a written proof, in symbolic logic&quot; (p. 179) often follow many enormously important discussions in History and Moral Philosophy. This type of proof (or even just the suggestion that such a proof exists) seems to apparently putting the matter to rest; regardless of its controversial, political, and subjective nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this strike anyone else as a perversion of the humanities? Not everything  can be an &quot;exact science&quot; (p. 182) with one right answer. I cherish needing different models (yeah, there&#039;s some truth in looking at morals as deriving purely from nature and nurture; but I also find much meaning from considering some transcendental role), so it frustrates me that Starship Troopers describes a &#039;one right, proovable, answer&#039; world. Interestingly, your answers in such a universe are still going to depend on your initial assumptions... you can&#039;t prove everything. The biggest assumption made, that science works and teaches them Truth about the real world, can be neither proved or disproved, only debated and assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might science fiction like ST or Foundation disregard any need for non-scientific truth? Yes, the intended audience might be more familiar with science as authority, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s all there is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Perhaps the film isn&#039;t totally ridiculous...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/38</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Heinlein is not overly concerned with subtlety.  Perhaps fearful of some particularly dense reader missing his unmitigated support of the military, big government and capital punishment, Heinlein places only the thinnest of sci-fi veils over his long-winded political monologues.  This does not make it a bad read â€“ the plot is still compelling â€“ but when I reach the scenes of History and Moral Philosophy classes, I do want to throw something at him, as roseblack says.  This future world in which Johnny Rico operates has indeed been radically altered.  The military has risen in power and influence, technological advances are responsible for major military and social changes, and the increased globalization of Terra has resulted in cultural assimilation.  The film version, while truly atrocious when taken seriously, takes on a new and deeper meaning when read as an oppositional text.&lt;br /&gt;
As Heinlein portrays it, Rico&#039;s society is near perfect, or at least a great improvement on our own.  The new style of democracy &quot;insure[s] that all who wield it [the vote] accept the ultimate in social responsibilityâ€¦to wager his own lifeâ€¦to save the life of the state&quot; (184).  The Federation of the film, however, has definite fascist tendencies; they control voting rights, reproductive rights, and the media.  Significant segments are viewed through the Federation&#039;s media channel, heavily laden with World War II style propaganda and an almost sadistic celebration of executions and gore.  An authoritative male voice narrates, and in one advertisement asks &quot;Want to know more?&quot; over the sound of a crowd cheering at a death sentence.  They seem more to be hallmarks of a dystopia than a perfected society.&lt;br /&gt;
The main character, Juan Rico, is renamed John Rico in the film, the actor&#039;s blonde hair and blue eyes stereotypically Anglo.  It underlines the loss of ethnic and cultural diversity in Starship Troopers, something that Heinlein glosses over or even celebrates in his writing. In the book, Rico is from Buenos Aires but is still an English speaker.  He is part of the social elite, one of the richest of his peers, part of the hegemonic order that clearly adheres to a Western patriarchal society&#039;s ideals.  Globalization has destroyed all other culture&#039;s values.  The film highlights this in its transformation of Rico, indicating his adherence to our social order.  Further underlining this Western hegemony is the only Hispanic in the movie, a fellow member of boot camp who admits he is only in the military because his family does not have enough money to send him to Harvard, placing him in the same lower classes than the current stereotyped image of Hispanics today.  Religion, pretty much the most powerful divider throughout human history, has only the slightest presence in the book, meriting only a passing mention in the beginning that the same Catholic priest is sufficient for &quot;Moslems, Christians, Gnostics, Jewsâ€¦&quot;(4).  Even religion does not really matter anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
A final stake to the heart of the book is in the film&#039;s battle scenes.  Heinlein&#039;s military is at its peak of efficiency and power.  The M.I. are superhuman, well-trained killing machines.  In appearance, the film&#039;s soldiers are barely different from today&#039;s; the only improvement seems to be the increased presence of nuclear weapons, which are more just big bombs than the ultimate in death and destruction.  Soldiers run in disorderly swarms across the screen, firing indiscriminately, and poorly, in the general direction of the Bugs before beating a hasty, and often cowardly, retreat.  They come across as badly trained and just plain unequipped to deal with a threat, rather than the book&#039;s depiction of a dominant fighting force that has finally met its match in the Bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&lt;Insert witty title for my response here&gt;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/35</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In our Monday class, we touched on Heinlein&#039;s use of the History and Moral Philosophy teachers as voices of political commentary and social criticism.  As clumsy or obvious as that may have seemed, his choice to do this very much ties into the idea of Science Fiction as an unappreciated genre for commenting on society and our own culture by using distance, alien cultures and/or the passage of time to reflect from a simulated outside perspective.  The Freedman article definitely seemed like a stretch in some places, but both that and the Suvin were trying to highlight the place of Science Fiction in modern life and relate it to reality.  Much of the Sci-Fi that is readily available in the consumer market can be appreciated solely for its entertainment value and dismissed when one tries to wedge it into any kind of greater moral philosophy â€“ what comes to mind most readily being many of the Star Wars Expanded Universe books such as the Rogue Squadron series.  Interestingly, the original Star Wars movies are full of philosophy and commentary on the disconnection and contamination of the human mind.  Yoda comes up frequently in many non-Sci-Fi related theoretical discussions, at least in the mind of this nerd, because of some unexpectedly wise statements.  One that came to mind recently in a discussion of the body/mind conundrum was &quot;luminous beings are weâ€¦not this crude matter.&quot;  However, it seems that Science Fiction is often considered to be an entertainment genre and not worthy of greater study or dissection in order to assess a potentially richer commentary on our present society.  Certainly there are exceptions, for example, George Orwell&#039;s 1984 definitely can fit into the Sci-Fi category and is required reading for every school child.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, trying to return to a focus on Heinlein and his work, it was surprising, especially after watching the film as well, to consider the ideas of sexism.  While not considering myself an overly sensitive person, six semesters at Scripps teaches one to be aware of potential points of controversy from a feminist perspective.  Yet there seemed nothing overly offensive to women, nor anything to suggest that women had a limited place in Heinlein&#039;s concept of the future.  Heinlein, contrary to the movie version, does not include women in the M.I., but does not exclude them from the military in other areas, as was the case for all but nurses at the time he wrote the book.  At first his decision to have the women pilots shave their heads was confusing, but once explained it made perfect sense and highlighted some of the more ludicrous details of the film that separated from Heinlein&#039;s vision.  He also commented several times on the importance of women for morale purposes, simply their presence on ships boosted the interest of the men in fighting that much harder.  Knowing of his previous experience as a veteran himself, this was undoubtedly from deeply felt emotions of his own during that time and not intended to objectify or belittle women.  Perhaps it shows the absolute opposite, to elevate women and illuminate them as of great importance to society, the protection of the species and Man&#039;s necessity for a counterpart.  The concept of partnership was absent from the social hierarchy of the bugs, with the workers and soldiers being expendable and easily replaceable pawns for the Queen, or Queens, to dispose of as she saw fit.  The contrast of these two systems of procreation and gender roles served to point out the importance of Man&#039;s humanity, the value of the individual and the undying devotion to preserving the good parts of our society.  As a final side note, had the bugs had more &quot;human&quot; methods of relating to one another and perhaps possessed the ability to love, they would have been a much harder target to demonize and annihilate in the way that they were.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Signifying Absences: Amputation in Starship Troopers</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/34</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(By way of a response) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The hand he had offered me was the one that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (39)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several amputees are featured prominently in Starship Troopers. This is not exactly surprising; the dangerous combat and training to which &quot;cap troopers&quot; are subjected result in frequent death and maiming. The specific mention of people&#039;s amputated limbs serves a couple different purposes that are immediately distinguishable: on the one hand (pun regrettably intended), there is the Fleet Sergeant Ho model, in which the amputated limb is a warning, a &quot;horror show&quot; (39); on the other hand, there is the Dubois model, in which a nonlimb is displayed prominently as a badge or marker denoting experience, sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is careful not to lay out these two alternate significances too schematically. Chronologically, the first amputee whom Johnnie encounters is Mr. Dubois, the History and Moral Philosophy teacher. Of Mr. Dubois Johnny recalls: &quot;He would just point at you with the stump of his left armâ€¦&quot; (25). Clearly, Mr. Dubois cannot fall under the &quot;horror show&quot; category--although Johnnie does claim that Mr. Dubois &quot;discourages&quot; his students from serving (23). However, it is somewhat misleading to say that Mr. Dubois is the paradigmatic example of the missing-limb-as-ultimate-badge-of-honor character, if only because Johnnie does not immediately recognize what, exactly, Mr. Dubois&#039;s missing limb means--that is, Johnnie does not know until much later exactly how much experience Dubois had, how much he sacrificed. When Johnnie is in boot camp, he receives a letter from Dubois, the signature of which bears a surprisingly high rank: &quot;We supposed (if we thought about it at all) that he must have been a corporal or some such who had been let out when he lost his hand and had been fixed up with a soft job teaching a course that didn&#039;t have to be passedâ€¦&quot; (91). Dubois&#039;s rank--Lieutenant Colonel--raises his status in Johnnie&#039;s eyes, such that Dubois&#039;s having taken a job teaching high school suddenly seems to him sort of heroic, rather than an easy retirement option; such that Dubois&#039;s amputated limb becomes not a mere ticket to a &quot;soft job&quot; but a distinguishing sign of &quot;honor.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading of characters&#039; phantom limbs is more immediately accessible both to Johnnie--and, by proxy, to the reader--when Johnnie reaches officers&#039; training: &quot;Most of the instructors, especially the officers, were disabled. The only ones I can remember who had a full complement of arms, legs, eyesight, hearing, etc., were some of the non-commissioned combat instructors--and not all of those&quot; (174). Johnnie&#039;s thinking at this point parallels neatly with the thoughts of his high-school self: &quot;At first I wondered why those obvious candidates for physical retirement and full-pay pension didn&#039;t take it and go home. Then I quit wondering&quot; (174). At first blush, &quot;Then I quit wondering&quot; sounds sort of like &quot;if we thought about it at all.&quot; However, in the later case, Johnnie recognizes in his instructors&#039; actions the &quot;virtuous&quot; tautology of military service; MI fight because they are MI, we are repeatedly reminded; so, too, Johnnie concludes, it can be said only that his instructors did not retire because they are not retirees. Point being, Johnnie stops thinking about their reasoning not because he doesn&#039;t care but because he recognizes the valor that inheres in these men&#039;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in the second model is the violence of war--the fact that necessitates or realizes amputation--actually implied. The second model is peculiar, too, because singular and short-lived: Fleet Sergeant Ho is the only given example of the Fleet Sergeant Ho model: &quot;A fleet sergeant sat at a desk there, in dress uniform, gaudy as a circus. His chest was loaded with ribbons I couldn&#039;t read. But his right arm was off so short that his tunic had been tailored without any sleeve at allâ€¦and, when you came up to the rail, you could see that he had no legs&quot; (28). Although Johnnie says that &quot;it doesn&#039;t seem to bother&quot; Ho very much, it does make an impression on Johnnie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days later, Johnnie meets the same man outside the recruiting station, walking and gesturing with a full set of prostheses: &quot;I don&#039;t have to put on my horror show after working hours,&quot; he explains to Johnnie (39). Here, the second model collapses into the first; Ho congratulates Johnnie on joining the MI, shakes hands with him using a prosthetic limb, and Johnnie, only briefly &quot;horrified,&quot; never looks back.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Starship Troopers Critical Response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/33</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering the points that the class made on Monday concerning the definition of Science Fiction, the way this novel presents the present psychology of chastisement and punishment outlined in the lecture given by Mr. Dubois to the History and Moral Philosophy class was very interesting. (pg 112-120)  Starting with an effective analogy given to Juan about the training of puppies and ending with an explanation as to why a nation based on &quot;pseudo-psychological nonsense&quot; and a &quot;glorifiedâ€¦mythology of rights&quot; cannot endure, he logically explains how such a society, our society, cannot be stable.&lt;br /&gt;
	The beginning analogy of the housebreaking of puppies is very effective in giving a rough example of what should be done to perpetrators of crimes.  After the act, the animal is scolded, his or her nose is rubbed in the &#039;accident,&#039; and then he is swatted.  This is contrasted to the gang action that was apparently very common in the earlier stages of the novel&#039;s history (and in our world today.)  He asserts that by not giving them the proper upbringing as children, more specifically by not including pain in the punishment of crimes, the basic learning instincts of humanity was not utilized, and thus no lesson was learned.  So, on subsequent crimes, when the maximum crime was inflicted, it would be similar to never swatting a puppy, then shooting it after it&#039;s still are not housebroken as a full grown dog.&lt;br /&gt;
	A girl I the class comments on this, saying how she doesn&#039;t mind being swatted once in a while when compared to not being able to be outside at night.  This added point of view, the opposite of the modern idea, is a clever device.  Her ending comment, &quot;Why--that&#039;s horrible!&quot;, is a very human approach towards a seemingly inhumane way of thinking.  That is, that of increased, violent punishment as opposed to psychological therapy and understanding.  The idea is that the wrong way of thinking, our modern way, is &quot;half fuzzy-headed wishful thinking, half rationalized charlatanry.&quot;  Dubois asserts that, &quot;Man has no moral instinct.&quot;  This is an extremely nihilistic statement, proposing that not only is man no more than a highly trained animal, but also has no overarching moral sense, like that bestowed by divinity.  After this he goes on to propose that there is no morality, just an elaboration of the instinct to survive.  This is what brings him to the crux of his argument, which are the imperatives of survival that surpass that of the individual, and the loss of this in the old society.&lt;br /&gt;
	This includes the survival of family, children, and higher.  In the novel culture especially, the importance of the nation, planet, and even species are placed in higher regard.  By examining the problem faced by the individual in why one feels the need to place one&#039;s wellbeing on the line, one can tell how far up the moral ladder one can go.  Whether one is capable of giving one&#039;s life for a cause as lofty and obscure as &#039;the good of mankind.&#039;  The street gang members only reached the level of simple gang obedience; the never were taught or learned to look any higher.  Thus, any attempt to appeal to their morality or better natures is completely useless since there is nothing to appeal to.  They were given every opportunity and every benefit of the doubt, when in truth, says Mr. Dubois, they should have been punished immediately.  That was the major difference; instead of punishment, duty, and morality, they were taught they had rights.  Each juvenile that was pampered, that was not taught right from wrong and had it proven by instinct, was the result of the moral failings of an adult above him or her.  They championed rights they lost all sense of duty, to any level of society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Things that bug me</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/31</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found Starship Troopers to be a very disturbing read.  The story effectively chronicles Rico&#039;s assimilation into the Mobile Infantry.  It&#039;s a story of personal development, however, for such a story to be compelling, the protagonist needs to be a character for which the reader can have some pathos.  For someone like me, who doesn&#039;t believe in the necessity for a powerful military, relating to someone who chose to fight might be difficult.  However, Starship Troopers manages a wider appeal by presenting social context for the protagonist&#039;s actions.  Heinlein creates a universe where a human society has advanced significantly, to the point where war within the species is unheard of, but is founded on very different principles, which are very alien to me.  This makes character Rico much more sympathetic, because it allows him to have relatable priorities, such as racial equality, civil order, personal freedom, etc.  The only difference is that his ideology, which promotes these ideals, also leads to the notion that military is an integral part of a functional society.  What I found so disturbing in this book was that this ideology, which was contrary to many of my beliefs in a lot of ways, was very self-consistent, and logical in its formulation.&lt;br /&gt;
	The philosophy of people in the world of Starship Troopers is that force is a necessary part of maintaining order, and that order, aside from being a benefit in itself, yields prosperity.  On the simplest level, humanity embraces the use of force on a personal level.  Not only is the use of a spanking paddle common in homes and in school for the purpose of behavioral modification, but also, laws are enforced by public whippings.  I describe this as &quot;behavioral modification&quot;, because it is apparent that the society&#039;s notion of how to maintain order stems from the basic principles in potty-training a puppy.  In Professor Dubois&#039; lecture about the failures of the total democracies (our society), he asks Rico about how to train a puppy not to pee in the house, and Rico responds automatically that, &quot;You scold him so that he knows he&#039;s in trouble, you rub his nose in it so that he will know what trouble you mean, you paddle him so that he darn well won&#039;t do it again.&quot; (114)  Clearly, Rico is conditioned to think that physical force is necessary for changing an individual&#039;s undesirable behavior.  However, the idea of behavioral modification through force extends past the notion of the individual to modifying the behavior of a collective.  In a separate lecture by Professor Dubois,  a student presents the idea that violence solves nothing, but he retorts that &quot;Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor,&quot; citing the fact that an entire civilization&#039;s fate was determined when Roman armies destroyed Carthage. (26)  From this, the primacy of the military and Mobil Infantry becomes apparent.  According to the accepted thinking in this book, to maintain order, it is sometimes necessary to modify the behavior groups of people, or foreign nations, which disrupt order.  The optimal way to do this is to use controlled force, in order to compel a change in behavior.  Effectively, a paddle is to a pup as the Mobil Infantry is to uncooperative nations.&lt;br /&gt;
	The view that physical force is such an important part of civil society isn&#039;t a disturbing notion in itself, as cultures have espoused it before.  What is most unsettling is the justification is so well conceived.  A large part of the argument stems from the acknowledgement that humans, as well as most species, have evolved with an instinct for survival.  Any threat to survival should compel that species to adapt its behavior to limit that threat.  The philosophy of the future is that any good citizen is motivated by the same thing that a heinous criminal is.  Professor Dubois describes morality as &quot;an elaboration of the instinct to survive.&quot; (118)  What he means by this, is that moral code, and other socially beneficial qualities, aren&#039;t an inherent quality of man, but have been instilled in him by the society by appealing to his desire so survive.  Unlike, today, in the future, morality is seen as a scientifically justifiable construct.&lt;br /&gt;
	As a believer in evolution and science, these arguments are almost convincing.  However, the book reveals a weakness in this view of an effective society.  It claims that running a society is a matter of scientific analysis and proof, however, science requires evidence.  When Rico is taking History and Moral Philosophy as a cadet, the professor asks why the system of veterans voting is most effective, stumping his students.  He admits that &quot;the reason for continuing [this] system is the same as the practical reason for continuing anything: It works satisfactorily.&quot; (181)  However, this applies to more than just voting.  It applies to the entire system of government in this futuristic world.  The book claims that this method is most effective by science of empirical evidence, however, as a reader, I have no real evidence that such a system should work, and for that reason, I am no longer presented with a moral dilemma. â˜º&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First Response!</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/29</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So here it is, my very first reading response for my very first lit class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was reading Starship Troopers over the weekend, I found that I was rather surprised with the parallels between the Bugs and the people of the Terran Federation. There seemed to be this common need to put the needs of the group in general before the needs of the individual. This in turn, I found a bit strange because I was under the impression that Heinlein was opposed to communism which is almost what he was advocating. Anyway, there were two parallels in particular that caught my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first parallel has to do with citizenship. To earn it, a person has to put in their two or more years of federal service, in the military or otherwise, and only then are they entitled to vote. According to Colonel Dubois, &quot;citizenship isâ€¦an emotional conviction that the whole is greater than the part&quot; (163).  Rather than the importance of the individual within society, it is the society, or at least a larger group than just the individual, that matters. This is, apparently, even mathematically provable according to Juan&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy class. &quot;All correctâ€¦ moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level -- as in a father who dies to save his children&quot; he says (185). The greater good being more important than that of the individual seems to be true of the Bugs as well, although they don&#039;t ever question these actions. Certain castes are simply destined to carryout whatever actions they are delegated. They are, in essence, programmed to die so that their race can survive. Interestingly, in both instances the behavior stems from instinct despite the two races being quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also leads me to think about the instance in which Juan determines that it is worth going to war to save just one man. This seems to counter the previous belief as here a greater group is worth sacrificing just to save one man who &quot;may not deserve it â€¦ [or] may die in the meantime&quot; because &quot;thousands of people get killed every day in accidents&quot; (178).  I suppose this has to do with the military belief that no man should be left behind, but the fact that it opposes what has been established as human instinct strikes me as rather interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second comparison between MIs and Bug society is to do with the hierarchy established by each. It almost seems at times that the ideal MIs structure is close to that of the Bugs. The people at the bottom have their orders and are expected to carry them out, if not, they run the chance of suffering the same fate as the Third Lieutenant who fought in the Napoleonic Wars, who &quot;was tried for `deserting his post of duty as commanding officer in the presence of the enemy.&#039; Convicted. Cashiered&quot; even though he had been trying to save his commanding officer (194).  The worker Bugs on the other hand are &quot;hardly more than animate machinery&quot; and cannot disobey and warriors are &quot;are almost as stupid without a director as workers&quot; (194). What the MIs strive for is what the Bugs are born with although both have an instinct to place the needs of many above the needs of few.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>First response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/28</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not really like Starship Troopers. It was a quick read and I thought the descriptions of the technology used and of the action were interesting, but ultimately the novel just felt like a piece of propaganda to me. The military is very glamorized and Heinlein&#039;s own political views are beat into the reader throughout the story. Both of these aspects of the story brought down the novel for me, as Starship Troopers seems like a call to action for people to either support or join the military and perform the noblest action of all, which is to put one&#039;s life at stake for one&#039;s country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that made Starship Troopers feel like propaganda is how much the Mobile Infantry is praised. It is depicted as an extremely effective and efficient branch of the military that does a lot of the dirty work for the homeland, a group that gets the job done and takes action when needed. One of the most prominent aspects of the Mobile Infantry is its sense of brotherhood. Various outfits of the Mobile Infantry, such as Rasczak&#039;s Roughnecks, are described as being as close as family. Everything seems to run smoothly, as all the soldiers work and fight together in harmony. The Mobile Infantry accomplishes all of this by never leaving any person behind on missions. Whenever possible, all soldiers make it their life&#039;s duty to retrieve wounded soldiers who have fallen behind. All of this combines to paint a very majestic picture of the Mobile Infantry, and really of the military in general. This is what I meant when I stated previously that Heinlein glamorizes the military. Admittedly, Heinlein does not characterize the Mobile Infantry as perfect. Portions of the book are devoted to describing the arduous training required to join the Mobile Infantry, including injuries and deaths resulting from the training. However, this in a way acts to further glamorize the military. The final message regarding the Mobile Infantry seems to be that every person has paid his or her dues to get in, and once a person is in, he or she is family and from that point on acts as the epitome of a citizen by putting his or her life at stake to protect the homeland. It just seems too perfect to me. Somebody mentioned in class that Starship Troopers is required reading for most of the military academies in the United States, and I can see the reasoning behind it. Soldiers are put on a pedestal in this novel and idolized. Late in the story, even Rico&#039;s father, who was completely opposed to the military, joins the Mobile Infantry because he feels that it will make his life more fulfilling. This surprise event just made Starship Troopers feel even more like a piece of propaganda, since in the end, even the most vehement opponent of the military has a change of heart and joins because it is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starship Troopers just seems to be an excuse for Heinlein to spread his political views; the story exists to solely to link together the various classroom discussion sections, which is the other major aspect of the story that brought it down for me. I understand that novels are constantly used as vehicles for authors to express their philosophical and political musings - I do not object to this if the commentary is implemented well. The problem I have with Starship Troopers is that Heinlein comes off as very self-righteous to me. As I progressed through the novel, Heinlein&#039;s commentary became more and more obnoxious. He uses Dubois to express his views and he presents them as fact. Dubois is seen as this omniscient, infallible character who is always right, and it is this character who presents much of Heinlein&#039;s views. Any time the story switched to a Dubois lecture, I felt like the situation changed to where Heinlein is directly lecturing the reader about what is right and what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Women in Starship Troopers - A More Well-Supported Argument</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/27</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is a little more formal than what others have been posting, but here it is anyway. It&#039;s somewhat an expansion of the comment I made earlier, with some more points and some textual support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a surface reading, it appears that women are a respected group in Starship Troopers. Rico repeatedly speaks of the intelligence of his friend Carmencita (27, among others), and he admires the prowess of the pilots that fly him into battle (9). However, when it comes down to it, there is little place for strength and honor among women in his world. In fact, Rico&#039;s attitude towards women is indicative of the systematic lack of respect that his society accords women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico has two key close interactions with women of his own age in the book, both with Carmencita Ibanez. In the first, he is surprised when Carmencita tells him she wants to sign up for Federal service, since &quot;little Carmen was so ornamental that you just never thought about her being useful&quot; (26). It is hard to overstate how well this describes Rico&#039;s attitude toward women, whether they be his peers or his superiors. Though they may have key roles, Rico never considers them to have any kind of fundamentally important role in the workings of the universe. In fact, when Carmen gains some responsibility, Rico begins to respect her, but only insofar as she gains what he considers to be masculine qualities â€“ he finally sees her as an &quot;officer and a fighting man â€“ as well as a very pretty girl&quot; (139). In Rico&#039;s eyes, a warrior must be male, and if Carmen has these qualities, they must be separate from her femininity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the pilots in Starship Troopers seem to be a counter-example to this prejudice. Though every single soldier in the M.I. is male, the navy pilots are invariably female, and play a vital role in getting the soldiers to the ground safely. They are well-loved by the men whose lives are in their hands, and they hold absolute authority over their ship. But really, how respected are they? They are at most mid-ranking officers, who control their ship and perform a specific duty. In their capacity as troop transport drivers, they simply take the soldiers from one place to another, and never participate actively in the battle. As captains of navy warships, as mentioned in the book, they stand off at a distance and pound bug planets into oblivion. They are never present in the grit of the battlefield, and thus have no way to gain honor and respect in the eyes of the army men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one non-pilot female mentioned in the book, aside from Rico&#039;s mother, is actually smarter and more on top of things than her superior, and yet explicitly cut out of the chain of command. This is Miss Kendrick, the secretary to Rico&#039;s instructor Colonel Nielssen at the Officer academy. Colonel Nielssen admits that he signs &quot;anything, if Miss Kendrick has initialed it,&quot; and yet if he were to die, she would &quot;not do a blessed thingâ€¦because she is not in the line of command and has no authority&quot; (150). By all rights, Miss Kendrick should be the one making commands, but she is a woman, and thus is not able to gain the respect she needs to make such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, no woman in Starship troopers would be able to reach a seriously high level in the military. In order to become a general, and command the overall structure, a soldier has to work his way up through both the navy and the army. Conceivably, a woman could work her way up through the navy, but there is not a single woman in the army, so she could never gain the highest position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the number of women involved in the military, it seems that this power disparity would continue when the women returned from federal service. Rico&#039;s society is strictly militaristic, and the most respected roles are those of the military. It follows that the most respected individuals in the Federal government are those that participate at a high level in military service. In comparison to the size of the army, the navy is very small, in terms of man-power, and not all of the people in the navy are women. As such, the number of male respected citizens would far outweigh the number that are female, and so the women will likely have as little say in the non-military aspects of governance as they do in the military sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final effect of the societal disregard for women firmly marginalizes them in the Starship Troopers universe. They are respected in some small sense, but nevertheless are systematically left out of any important, guiding, decision-making capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Choice: Always a Hot Issue</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/25</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many things we discussed in class, there was one topic that intrigued me the most--perhaps because it was only briefly touched upon. Someone mentioned the apparent paradox that the enemy Bug society is pure communism and yet the human society considers that system ideal. Certainly it is intriguing that the M.I. are fighting against a system they have bought into. Consider the fact that people are only &quot;legal residents&quot; until they have served at least two years in the Federal Service, following their government&#039;s plans and putting the good of the nation before personal gain and safety. Only when they have overcome their individualism can they be a true citizen and thus gain the right to vote. The simple idea behind this is, of course, communism; each part must work to better the whole. Their society rewards the choice to follow communist ideals because they well know that communism makes a nation amazingly strong when it must fight. Of course, this is why it is so difficult to defeat the purely communist Bugs. The question is, if the human society considers communism ideal, what differentiates them from the Bugs? Are they not just as bad (or good, as the subjective analysis may read)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the difference is the choice, the completely voluntary decision to join the Federal Service. I say interestingly because choice is an individualistic ideal, while giving an affirmative to the choice presented will result in a dissolution of the self into simply a part of the whole. At the same time, this paradoxical nature of the choice maintains the importance of the individual, an idea that has always been valued in American culture and the belief that differentiates the humans from the Bugs. Indeed, the humans&#039; government as a whole appears rather human itself; it understands that the best option is to have a communist system when it comes to fighting a war, but at the same time, it wants its people to realize this on their own because they will make stronger, more passionate fighters. As humans, we naturally want something much more if we have chosen it (or believe the illusion that we have) than if we have been forced upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one question, however. Is the choice truly voluntary? It appears to be so, but the society definitely pushes its residents toward the &quot;right decision.&quot; Veterans can vote, usually hold better jobs, and appear to live more fulfilling lives. Also, at least in Juan&#039;s case, the conviction to join seems only to grow when authority figures question the certainty of the decision. Undoubtedly, there is at least a subconscious push toward joining the Federal Service. Perhaps that is why, as I believe Mr. Dubois mentions, there are too many unskilled or militarily incompetent people for whom random jobs must be created.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bugs in Starship Troopers as Nature, not Race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that it&#039;s a common trope in science fiction for ideas about divisions of race to be transplanted to racial boundaries â€“ as if the authors are saying, &quot;Look, if they can get along with wookies, why can&#039;t we humans all get along among ourselves?&quot; It&#039;s such a common device, in fact, that it becomes difficult to recognize when alien species are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent ethnicities. However, the Bugs from &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; may actually be something different â€“ for lack of a better term, I&#039;ll describe their presence as a force of Nature, not Race (with a capital R) in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the relationship between the humans of the Terran Federation and the Bugs doesn&#039;t resemble racial conflict â€“ the only interactions between the two are acts of destruction. Historically, racial conflict doesn&#039;t take the form of immediate, all-out war: the Europeans and American Indians were able to participate in trade and exchange of ideas before prejudice and hatred built up to cause the two sides to begin fighting each other; trade in slaves from Africa was facilitated at least by the cooperation of some leaders within that continent; even the American Civil War was not fought as a battle of &quot;black versus white&quot; at all. However, in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;, the two sides are not just completely at odds with each other militarily: the Terran Federation &quot;[understands] [the Bugs] as little as [it] [understands] termites&quot; (222). The Terran Federation doesn&#039;t even have the faintest idea what the Bugs&#039; motivation is for fighting or when it might be possible to declare peace â€“ they don&#039;t even really know how bugs live, other than the very basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bugs and the humans appears most obviously in Johnny&#039;s proof about war as a cause of population pressure: &quot;Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us outâ€“because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate&quot; (186). This begins to resemble the conflict between American Indians and Europeans, but in the case of the American Indians, as members of the same species, they ended up becoming somewhat mixed in with the European population that invaded â€“ no such thing is possible (as far as we can see) with the Bugs. The conflict is meant to be seen in a similar situation as that of the &quot;retarded&quot; wildlife of Sanctuary - &quot;When types that had evolved on a planet enjoying high radiation and fierce competition were introduced, the native stuff was outclassed&quot; (155). The humans and the Bugs in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t communicate, they don&#039;t intermarry and they certainly don&#039;t hold Thanksgiving dinners together before killing each other: they&#039;re opposing species from different environments, and when they come into conflict, it&#039;s kill or be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Responses to class discussions</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/23</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone in class on Monday had mentioned that in the MI, humans are the (vessel for) technology.  I think this is an interesting point, especially in conjunction with the developments of our current military.  The United States Army has been implementing robots in the Middle East to prevent unnecessary casualties.  Soldiers can now direct these robots, which can detect and disable mines and have the capability of firing back at any hostiles, with remote controls from a safe distance away.  There remains that element of human judgment, although in a much more diluted form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I had contemplated applying to West Point or joining RoTC; as for the use of this book by the various military academies in the United States, which was brought up in class, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scary thing.  Starship Troopers stresses loyalty to the government and to protection of the general population, as well as the concept of &quot;leave no man behind.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this book justifies violence in a way that makes sense (I&#039;m not saying I advocate it) and would mitigate the dissent of people who are against American troops in Iraq (namely those who harass soldiers or marines about &quot;supporting the war&quot;).  I pulled this particular quote because it reminded me of another quote (Was it Alfred Lord Tennyson who wrote &quot;Ours is not to reason why.  Ours is but to do or die.&quot;?): &quot;The purpose of war is to support your government&#039;s decisions by force...Not killing..but controlled and purposeful violence.  But it&#039;s not your business or mine to decide the purpose of the control.  It&#039;s never a soldier&#039;s business to decide when or where or how--or why--he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals...&quot; (63).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had watched the movie long before ever reading this book and I can remember my initial thoughts: Wow this movie must have been a low budget film.  After reading ST and re-watching the adaptation, I also noted that: 1]It&#039;s strange that most of the characters look/are white, but have retained their more &quot;ethnic&quot; names 2]Dizzy Flores is a female and 3]Women are allowed in the MI for the sake of gratuitous female nudity...?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 1</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/15</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I would like to preface this response paper by saying that I am not a science fiction reader.  With the exception of Handmaid&#039;s Tale, which I read purely on the basis of its being by Atwood, I have never even heard of any of the books on the syllabus.  However, I am an English major, and I thought it downright prejudiced of me to discount an entire genre without even giving it a chance.  That being said, I loved Starship Troopers.  It wasn&#039;t a particularly great book--I found myself wincing at the dialogue, for example--but it was, in the words of a very wise friend of mine, &quot;like reading an action movie.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fortunately, I feel as though there is much more to the book version of Starship Troopers than the horrific action movie that came of it.  For a while, I toyed with the concept of the Bugs as other races, reduced to nothing more than mindless, vicious killers.  However, I think that this impression doesn&#039;t give Heinlein enough credit.  To me, the bugs seemed simply too primitive to be another race, and their creation of separate classes made them more of an anti-caste statement than a racial slur. Rico&#039;s volatile hatred of them: &quot;those Bugs make me queasy&quot; made me think of them as nothing more elaborate than another species (13).  In addition to his own personal hatred of the creatures, they are constantly going on &quot;bug hunts,&quot; a term that reduces them firmly to animal level. Although it is possible that I am simply too naÃ¯ve to think of anyone as hating another race so much that they could happily &quot;[smack] down any Bugs that showed their ugly heads&quot; (225), it seems that, at least to Rico, the Bugs are nothing more than animals.  Heinlein&#039;s book seems, if anything, attempting to disregard the importance of race entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the more subtle cues to this racial oblivion comes in the character of the father.  At the beginning of the novel, Rico&#039;s father comes off as the most closed-minded character, absolutely adamant against the idea of his son joining the forces.  He was, to me, the least admirable character, and he did not like other races.  Rico&#039;s father sees Mr. Dubois as a catalyst for his son&#039;s entry into the army.  When he hears Dubois&#039;s name, he instantly retorts with, &quot;â€¦a silly name--it suits him.  Foreigner, no doubt&quot; (23).  This comment serves to accentuate the father&#039;s close-mindedness and also caused me to second-guess my theory of the Bugs as a vilified other race.  If Heinlein had xenophobic leanings, why would he not put them into the mouth of a more sympathetic character?&lt;br /&gt;
Another hint came surprisingly late--the racial identity of the central character.  Only on page 260, when I discovered that Rico&#039;s native language was Tagalong, did I realize that he was Filipino.  Obviously, I realized that he was not White (simply because of his last name), but I had no idea that he was Filipino until that line.  This realization means that Heinlein chose to cast a non-White character as the hero of his novel.  In addition to Rico, his &quot;love interest&quot; is also obviously non-White.  With a name like Carmencita Ibanez, she seems intentionally blatantly foreign.&lt;br /&gt;
In general, the issues of race don&#039;t seem overly important to Heinlein.  He obviously didn&#039;t feel like the main character&#039;s heritage was very important, and his characters were, in general, unconcerned with race.  He even says that his world&#039;s democracy is one &quot;unlimited by race [or] color&quot; (183). However, I was shocked to realize the connection that Heinlein made between their egg-laying and the Chinese population: &quot;â€¦the Bug commissars didn&#039;t care any more about expending soldiers than we cared about expending ammo.  Perhaps we could have figured this out about the Bugs by noting the grief the Chinese Hegemony gave the Russo-Anglo-American Alliance&quot; (153).  In all honesty, I was not sure what to make of this comment.  It seemed subtly tossed in, but it really surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I think that this was more a statement about fears of over-population and the expendability of the human race.  The Army is an organization that relishes the idea of abandoning individuality, and I think that Heinlein, despite his military pride, was warning his readers against this very concept.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What did the bugs represent to you?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/12</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was reading this book it occurred to me that the the &quot;bugs&quot; that the humans are fighting could potentially represent some different themes.  The ones that I could quickly come up with are: (1) there were some obvious communist references to the bugs&#039; way of life and getting rid of the &quot;bugs&quot; or commies might be something Heinlein is trying to say.  Considering the book was written in 1959 I think this could make sense. (2) As was briefly mentioned in class on Wednesday, when inter-species extermination is involved, racial purification might be implied.  Especially since the humans were portrayed as better than the bugs. (3) I&#039;m more inclined to believe that it doesn&#039;t really matter.  Heinlein needed some type of enemy so that he had a forum to lay out his political beliefs.  Much to my surprise (and disappointment) this book did not really contain that much action (unlike the movie) and to me it felt like this book was more of a political statement (i.e. pro military, kind of fascist etc...) than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Those were the main ones I could come up with and I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas/thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
