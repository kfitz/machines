 <title>Moira--Freeeeeedooooommmmmm</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;*I think I have a different addition, so my page numbers are probably very wrong. Sorry about that*&lt;br /&gt;
I was unbelievably excited about the existence of Handmaid&#039;s Tale on this syllabus.  For one, it&#039;s one of my favorite books (apologies to the people who hate Atwood&#039;s constant metaphors).  Also, I didn&#039;t even think about it as being Science Fiction.  After reading Suvin&#039;s article, however, I had to redefine my definition of Science Fiction (at least a little).  Handmaid&#039;s Tale does seem to fit into his definition rather nicely, plopping its readers into the middle of a society that both could have come from ours and is shockingly different.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Offred doesn&#039;t really seem to fit into either of the two stereotypes we discussed in class: she&#039;s certainly not an ass-kicker, and she doesn&#039;t scream &quot;damsel in distress,&quot; either.  I wonder if this is at least partly due to Margaret Atwood&#039;s own gender.  However, I was interested to notice the character of Moira, who does seem to, at first, fall into that first category.  Offred even says, &quot;Moira was our fantasy&quot; (133).  The idealized female moves from a masculine fantasy to a feminine one, representing escape and freedom.  However, we later discover that she really is a fantasy for both genders, acting as a prostitute in the club the Commander haunts.    Offred&#039;s dream of &quot;gallantry from [Moira], swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; is lost in the prostitute that she&#039;s become (249).   Offred and Moira take two separate paths, but they both wind up serving men, and Moira&#039;s track is, societally, much more degrading. Handmaid&#039;s Tale takes the one female character who seems to have a dollop of a chance at freedom and puts her in the most degrading possible job.&lt;br /&gt;
However, her prostitution reminds me a lot of Molly&#039;s selling her body to get her implants: Moira sells her own body to get the few scraps of freedom that she can, admitting that she&#039;s &quot;not a martyr&quot; (249).  In some ways, Moira&#039;s character shows the perversion that her society has put into the minds of its women: the only escape is through sex, and that really is no escape at all.&lt;/p&gt;
