 <title>The future of the book (google talk)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So i attended the talk about the &quot;Googlization of Everything&quot; by Siva Vaidhyanathan, and wanted to comment on an issue which he addressed, and implied that other speakers had also addressed throughout the day.  That issue is what exactly will happen to the paper book in the future?  I have frequently had this argument with friends at home, and my stance is that the book will decline in popularity to the point that it is only used as a novelty item.  It seems that as more an more is loaded onto the internet, that books will inevitably follow the same path music is and become completely digital, with only a few exceptions.  &quot;Google book&quot; was an example I would site, but Siva examined the processes behind Google book, and seemed to show how its not as close as we like to think it is to being a universal library.  Searches will often bring up obscure texts, and it has yet to come close to the filtration level that an actual librarian can provide.  Also having a search engine determine how we find all of our information can be a very dangerous thing, for if it determines a text to be unimportant then it could disappear forever as &quot;result 10,453 out of 50,000&quot;.  Another interesting point was on how Google forms profiles on its users, and tailors its search results to what it interprets that user is looking for.  An easy situation to imagine in which this could be corrupted would be if a user&#039;s profile labels him or her as a political extremist one way or another, and then filters results to only include points of view that fit within that political extremism, perhaps preventing that person from branching out.  It seems that a universal library is not nearly as easy to compile responsibly as I thought&lt;/p&gt;
