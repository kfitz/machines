 <title>Time Trauma Fiction</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;There was much talk--and there might easily have been more--about Pattern Recognition&#039;s being legible as a 9/11 novel. The event is manifestly significant for the novel plot-wise, but also to the extent that it informs the book&#039;s disrupted sense of history. It&#039;s interesting, then, that Oryx and Crake was conceived under similar circumstances--might it then be possible to read this book as a response to 9/11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed in our first class on Pattern Recognition, the composition of Gibson&#039;s book was interrupted by the attacks on the World Trade Center towers. In &quot;My Life in Science Fiction,&quot; Atwood gives a similar account. What&#039;s of note, then, is how differently the writers respond, how differently they adapt their respective works in progress to reflect what feels to them a different world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think I need to say much about how significant Gibson&#039;s work clearly thinks 9/11 is. Although it&#039;s only, like, a thirtieth of the book, it pervades the rest in really palpable ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Atwood responds by taking a culturally inward turn. In The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, the closest we get to the quasi-apocalyptic act that catalyzed the sociopolitical lockdown that&#039;s the novel&#039;s main interest is a vague reference to Islamic terrorists. As Atwood notes in her essay, though, &quot;It&#039;s deeply unsettling when you&#039;re writing about a fictional catastrophe and a real one happens.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally, this novel works pretty similarly to the earlier one. We&#039;re immediately plunged into a nightmare scenario. There&#039;s cognitive estrangement to the extent that the reader is madly palpating the conventions and limits both official and personal in this new and utterly bizarre world. As in THT, we&#039;ve the general sense that something really, truly awful happened that precipitated the mess we&#039;re witnessing; as in THT, we&#039;re given no clues as to what that might be. At least to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this formal structure, one would assume that the nature of the event itself--whatever it was that gave rise to the new order as it exists in the novel--would be rather more malleable. In which case--and given Atwoods concerns as voiced in her earlier novel--isn&#039;t it all the stranger that Atwoods imaginary apocalypse in Oryx and Crake comes from within, rather than from without?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the result is much the same. For Gibson, 9/11 causes a rupture in history. When he represents the event in his novel, he switches tenses. London functions as a displaced metropolis--the novel is really about New York. The book does everything it can to disconnect us from time and space, as mimetic of mass trauma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oryx and Crake does basically the same things. On the first page, time is the primary question. A question of basic orientation, of order--&quot;Out of habit he looks at his watch&quot;; &quot;It causes a jolt of terror to run through him, this absence of official time&quot;; &quot;Nobody nowhere knows what time it is.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether she chooses to represent the events themselves or no, I&#039;d suggest that Atwood observes a mass dislocation of space and time as a consequence of 9/11 as Gibson does.&lt;/p&gt;
