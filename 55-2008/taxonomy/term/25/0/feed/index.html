 <title>Could talk some more about race, but...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/266</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is defined from the second page as someone who kicks ass: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment of his and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren&#039;t afraid of the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords require no demonstrations&quot; (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some satiric bite to Stephenson&#039;s picture of America as a cross between a streetfight and an NRA convention, but there is rather more to the violence than necessary that particular aim. Which is not to say that Stephenson worries to much about wearing his jokes out, or even advancing the plot smoothly. But there is another motive behind all this--it&#039;s central to Hiro&#039;s development as a character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street cimre. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.  Hiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken&quot; (271)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not plot that drives the violence of the book. It is not satire, either. It isn&#039;t even the congenital obsession of science fiction--the invention of new and amusing ways for characters to fold, spindle and mutilate each other. It is the way Hiro grows. We know he likes swords, we know that he no longer wants to be the world&#039;s baddest motherfucker, and we know that he can administer the coup de grace when he must.  Big parts of Hiro&#039;s personality, as Stephenson presents it, are caught up in the way he fights, and how he feels about that fighting. This seems, somehow, caught up in the way that he constructs gender--when he says all men under twenty-five, he means all men. If it were only Hiro, perhaps this could be overlooked. But it&#039;s not only Hiro, though. All three of the main male characters in SC are killers--Hiro, Raven and Uncle Enzo.  YT, a fifteen-year old girl, also fights when she has to, but it&#039;s non-lethal. She has a sonic skateboard that breaks glass, and pepper spray, and bracelets that give people shocks, but she doesn&#039;t use swords, or guns, or nuclear weapons. But it&#039;s Hiro&#039;s ex-girlfriend, the linguistic hacker Juanita, who shows the difference between men and women in Stephenson most explicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;First things first,&quot; Juanita says. &quot;The control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Okay, you get ready to grab the tablet, and I&#039;ll take out the control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;How are you going to do that? By cutting people up with swords?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yeah. That&#039;s the only thing they&#039;re good for.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Let&#039;s do it the other way around,&quot; Juanita says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence is intended to make the book more entertaining, at least--science fiction readers buy books much more preoccupied with killing than Snow Crash. And it is partly satirical, and Hiro is mocked (gently, compared to the treatment that just about everyone and everything else in the book gets) for it, but there is also a bonding between him and Raven, and Raven and Enzo, over their willingness to fight. A willingness that is needed, to survive in, and save, the America of the future.  For all his parodying, I think that Stephenson, whose vision of America is all the more nightmarish because it is one big free-fire zone, thinks this willingness is worthy of praise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing that concerns me, partly because of the way this novel follows Slow River in our Syllabus: in the not-too-distant future of cyberpunk, Is homosexuality an anachronism? After reading a few cyberpunk novels, I am beginning to wonder about the future of the love that dares not speak its name. Whether due to authorial puritanism or purposeful absence, there is an extreme void in the fiction of Neal Stephenson and William Gibson when it comes to either man-to-man or woman-to-woman love. Gibson skirts around the issue by being farely prudish about sex in general. In Neuromancer, the one encounter between Molly and Case is empty, and lacks any substantial repercussions on either character. Sex is like cyberspace, plug-in and plug-out, only cyberspace is the much more enjoyable of the two activities.  Snow Crash treats sexuality as virtually unchanged from today (with a few technological enhancements, such as the dentata). A natural sexual tension between YT and Hiro builds up through the novel, and much of the plot revolves around Hiro&#039;s desire to reinstate himself with Juanita, and YT&#039;s fling with Raven. Despite the prominence of the sexual side of human interaction, there are few to no references to homosexuality whatsoever in his novel. Where are they? Identity politics definitely exist (look at the apartheid burb-claves), yet no gay identity.  Stephenson&#039;s vision, where commercialized or self-designed avatars act as go-betweens for human interaction on the Street, both point to a redefinition of identity by the sudden lack of physical context to human interaction. In a sympathetic or even passive reading of Gibson or Stephenson, this redefinition implies an abandonment of sexual politics as a viable means of forming community. Considering the embracing of the Internet and WWW by the gay community, the absence of homosexuality in these futurist settings is problematic.  Well, I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>alien colonialism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/157</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my reading of &quot;Dawn,&quot; I found myself torn between where my sympathies should lie.  The Oankali seemed compassionate enough and Lilith&#039;s relationship with Nikanj struck me as genuine and surprisingly not creepy.  And yet it is difficult to trust the motives of a group of creatures that put humans asleep for centuries and then keep them trapped in a ship.  There were moments when Lilith&#039;s resistance annoyed me and then at other times I was shocked by her ability to cohabitate with these seemingly grotesque features.  I continually put myself in the position of Lilith and I was forced to acknowledge that I would not be nearly as brave or patient as her.  Being the only human among alien creatures is indeed a terrifying concept.  There was much criticism of Lilith&#039;s decision making in class and I have to argue in Lilith&#039;s defense.  I believe she went above and beyond what the majority of humans would have done in her situation.  Curt may be a brave man in the sense that he is absolutely determined to lead his life away from the Oankali.  But he is also foolish because he never gives the Oankali a chance to prove themselves as decent creatures.  Ultimately I realized that Lilith was such an appealing candidate to the Oankali because she was strong, intelligent and more importantly, open-minded.&lt;br /&gt;
 	Should the Oankali have forced the humans to cross breed with them?  No.  Do I understand why they did it?  Absolutely.  It would be ludicrous for anyone to claim that if a ship full of alien creatures landed on Earth tomorrow, we would not conduct numerous tests on them.  We would of course be fearful but our curiosity would overrule.  I am clearly more hesitant to say that humans would have any desire to mass procreate with them but I would not be surprised if there was some attempt at isolated cross breeding.  The Oankali are naturally very curious creatures.  They are simply fascinated by the race of humans and are eager to save them and then start a future with them.  While they are not open about all their intentions in the beginning, they are incapable of actually lying.  Akin &quot;had always found it easy to tell the truth and difficult to make himself lie&quot; (351).  Humans cannot boast this need for the truth.  &quot;Humans, on the other hand, lied easily and often.  They could not trust one another.  They could not trust one of their own who seemed too close to aliens, who stripped off her clothing and lay down on the ground to help her jailer&quot; (238).  While the Oankali hope to see the good in everyone, humans are  constantly doubtful.&lt;br /&gt;
	Within the first few chapters of &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; I had my mind set in favor the Oankali.  This is not to say that they did not make mistakes in their handling of the humans.  This is also not to say that they should serve as the epitome of morality.  But I do believe they are a more sophisticated race than the humans in many ways.  They display an inherent goodness that the humans simply don&#039;t have.  One must only look at how welcomed Tino was into the Oankali tribe in comparison to how carelessly and in fact violently the group of nomads treated baby Akin.  His presence excited many humans in Phoenix but this was only because they had desired a baby for so long and at least this one was normal looking.  And still, several of the humans are repelled by Akin because of his gray tongue and thus connection to the aliens.  They refuse to see the Oankali as a race in any way equal to them.  The fact their survival is thanks to these aliens means little to them.&lt;br /&gt;
	I found the story of the merger between the Oankali and the humans as a twisted version of extraterrestrial colonialism.  Here, the humans are essentially the savages who need to be taught how to inhabit the Earth.  However, the Oankali do not behave like traditional colonialists.  They do allow the humans to build their own villages; albeit with the knowledge that they can never have babies.  Rather than exerting violence on the humans, they give people like Lilith defense mechanisms against the humans who will most likely attack her.  This is because they understand humans&#039; inclination towards violence.  Akin describes how the nomads &quot;did hit each other occasionally.  Twice, a pair of them rolled in the mud, punching and clutching at one another.  Even when they did not fight, they cursed each other and cursed him.&quot; (334)  Two centuries after destroying the world through violence, humans still cannot resist the urge for physical aggression.  And yet they still carry the strong need to love and be loved.  Iriarte has great trouble letting Akin go because he reminds him of one of his children.  This is why the humans&#039; dilemma is so problematic and why it is ultimately so difficult to choose sides.  I believe that the humans need to recognize the flaws that almost killed them before and at least attempt to understand the creatures that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Responses to class discussions</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/23</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone in class on Monday had mentioned that in the MI, humans are the (vessel for) technology.  I think this is an interesting point, especially in conjunction with the developments of our current military.  The United States Army has been implementing robots in the Middle East to prevent unnecessary casualties.  Soldiers can now direct these robots, which can detect and disable mines and have the capability of firing back at any hostiles, with remote controls from a safe distance away.  There remains that element of human judgment, although in a much more diluted form.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school I had contemplated applying to West Point or joining RoTC; as for the use of this book by the various military academies in the United States, which was brought up in class, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a scary thing.  Starship Troopers stresses loyalty to the government and to protection of the general population, as well as the concept of &quot;leave no man behind.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this book justifies violence in a way that makes sense (I&#039;m not saying I advocate it) and would mitigate the dissent of people who are against American troops in Iraq (namely those who harass soldiers or marines about &quot;supporting the war&quot;).  I pulled this particular quote because it reminded me of another quote (Was it Alfred Lord Tennyson who wrote &quot;Ours is not to reason why.  Ours is but to do or die.&quot;?): &quot;The purpose of war is to support your government&#039;s decisions by force...Not killing..but controlled and purposeful violence.  But it&#039;s not your business or mine to decide the purpose of the control.  It&#039;s never a soldier&#039;s business to decide when or where or how--or why--he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals...&quot; (63).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had watched the movie long before ever reading this book and I can remember my initial thoughts: Wow this movie must have been a low budget film.  After reading ST and re-watching the adaptation, I also noted that: 1]It&#039;s strange that most of the characters look/are white, but have retained their more &quot;ethnic&quot; names 2]Dizzy Flores is a female and 3]Women are allowed in the MI for the sake of gratuitous female nudity...?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Might Makes Right in ST</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/22</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To continue a discussion begun in class today, what is the function of violence in Starship Troopers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note:&lt;br /&gt;
-Suffrage was available only to those who completed their 2(+) years of voluntary service.&lt;br /&gt;
-Those who wish to serve a term of service can participate in non-overtly-violent ways (as terraformers, technicians, logistics, and human guinea pigs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is violence the only way to gain merit in this society?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, we only see through the narrator&#039;s perspective, who quickly learns that &quot;The Mobile Infantry is the Army. All the others are either button pushers or professors, along merely to hand us the saw; we do the dirty work&quot; (p. 39). His account of transformation throughout boot camp resounds with descriptions of physical labor; along the way characters settle a multitude of  power struggles with hand-to-hand combat (e.g. introduction of sergeant Zim, the showerroom scene with Ace). Juan earns real respect only after his first drop, and his father&#039;s love is only clear when his father risks his own life as a member of the MI. Again and again it&#039;s the willingness to engage in violence (interestingly, success doesn&#039;t seem to matter as much) that &#039;separates the men from the boys.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this story sticks close to its moral that a man earns respect by demonstrating &quot;through voluntary and difficult service that he places the welfare of the group ahead of personal advantage&quot; (p. 182).&lt;/p&gt;
