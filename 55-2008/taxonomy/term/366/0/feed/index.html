 <title>terrible humanity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/352</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What ended up sticking out to me most while reading Oryx and Crake was how little good was attributed to the human race (&quot;homo sapiens sapiens&quot; [Atwood 99]). It was rather strange that despite hearing the story from a human&#039;s point of view, from Snowman&#039;s reflections on the past, the reader is presented with quite a terrible view of humanity. One of the first things that was mentioned was about one of the questionable games Jimmy and Crake would play: Blood and Roses, Blood representing the terrible deeds people have done in the past and Roses representing human achievements, like literature. But as Jimmy points out, &quot;it was easier to remember the Blood stuff&quot; (80) This could be because humans have a tendency toward remembering shocking things, violent things, atrocious things more than mild and pleasing things. Alternatively, it could be because there truly have been more Blood events in history than Rose events. In either case, humanity is not represented in a very appealing light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, there are all the sites Jimmy and Crake surf amongst for entertainment when they are still teenagers: the &quot;Noodie News&quot; (81), &quot;Felicia&#039;s Frog Squash,&quot; &quot;hedsoff.com,&quot; &quot;alibooboo.com&quot; (82), &quot;shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and deathrowlive.com,&quot; and &quot;nitee-nite.com&quot; (83). The Noodie News is just kind of silly, with all the news reporters reporting while naked, but the other sites are not very pleasant. Felicia&#039;s Frog Squash is about exactly what it sounds like, and it is not alone it its type. Even more gruesome are hedsoff.com and alibooboo.com, where one can watch live executions and stonings from Asia and the Middle East. Similar sites representative of America are shortcircuit.com, brainfrizz.com, and deathrowlive.com, where, strangely, the men getting executed make a big show for the known viewers while the few women are killed in a very solemn affair, as if reminding everyone else that this punishment should not be entertainment. But the website that takes the cake, as it were, for showing how ridiculous people are is nitee-nite.com, where Jimmy and Crake can watch assisted suicides. The event is turned into a grand affair, and Snowman later reflects that &quot;killing yourself was something you did for an audience,&quot; and if he did it now, with no one around to see, the act would be without &quot;elegance&quot; (344). Since when is suicide an elegant affair? The ease with which movies are made and uploaded onto the Web seems to have prompted everyone to go after their fifteen minutes of fame--sometimes in less thoughtful ways. Using suicide as a way to finally get noticed seems to go quite against the point, and truly all of these sites portray the rather shallow side of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Crake is not shocked at this, and himself views humanity with not a little contempt. &quot;Monkey paws, monkey curiosity, the desire to take apart, turn inside out, smell, fondle, measure, improve, trash, discard--all hooked up to monkey brains, an advanced model of monkey brains but monkey brains all the same&quot; (99). While great minds of the past have often raised humanity on a pedestal above all other animals, Crake has a more cynical, and probably more realistic view of human capabilities. Our being basically monkeys is not necessarily a bad thing, though it is a blow to our ego to think that we&#039;re no better than animals when as a society we have believed this for quite a while. But Crake doesn&#039;t stop here; he sees so many imperfections and unnecessary evils in humans that he believes will soon destroy us that he creates an entirely new species that is so much better. Gone is hierarchy, religion, all the bad that has ever surrounded sex. Many of Crake&#039;s instructions to Jimmy/Snowman about taking care of the Crakers include watching out for emerging human traits, like developing art and symbols, because these are supposedly a sign of evil to come. Truly, I think this depressing view of humanity is encapsulated in poor Snowman&#039;s thought when describing his name: &quot;He&#039;s kept the abominable to himself&quot; (8). He feels that while he teaches the Crakers, he must keep his central human-ness away from them and not influence them to become just like the race that Crake had so despised.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gender Inequality in Oryx and Crake.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/339</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our brief discussion of how Snowman is a corrupting influence on the Crakers started me thinking about how Snowman teaches human principles of ranking. He introduces the concept that men and women should behave differently, picking the men to lead the trek and surround and protect the women and children. Biological sex differences may lead to men and women taking different roles, but Snowman assigns these roles of different value without explaining why, simply citing it as &quot;the proper way&quot; (350). The &quot;women and children&quot; are grouped together without question, and the narration implies that they *clearly* need protection, which is only available from the men. I don&#039;t know how a non-monogamous society would raise its young (I wonder if there are any non-extinct animals that work like that?), but it seems like it might break down existing gender roles, not re-enforce them more strictly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of comparison, consider the treatment of race. &quot;[R]acism â€“ or, as they referred to it in Paradice, pseudospeciation â€“ had been eliminated in the model group, merely by switching the bonding mechanism: the Paradice people simply did not register skin colour. Hierarchy could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes that would have created it&quot; (305). The Crakers are, in fact, color-blind when it comes to race. Unless the scientists were to completely make-over the reproductive process (a lÃ¡ Butler), gender differences will remain. So, can you have differences without an attached system of ranking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the words of sociologist Robert W. Fuller in his novel on &quot;rankism,&quot; a blanket term for all cases of abuse within a system of power differences (e.g. racism, sexism, classism, etc.): &quot;It is crucial to get one thing straight from the start: power differences, in themselves, are not the culprit. To bemoan power differences is like bemoaning the fact that the sun is brighter than the moon. And rank differences merely reflect power differences, so rank differences are not the problem either, any more than color or gender differences are used as an excuse to abuse, humiliate, exploit, and subjugate. So it is with power and rank&quot; (&quot;Somebodies and Nobodies&quot;, 4). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the conceptual idea for the Crakers is similar. The idea was that they would be so perfectly engineered that &quot;hierarchy could not exist among them, because they lacked the neural complexes that would have created it&quot; (305). I just don&#039;t quite understand how this could be possible. They were supposedly so perfectly engineered for their environment that they wouldn&#039;t need to make weapons, but they seemed pretty helpless without Snowman&#039;s gun. I think the context of real life outside of a predator-less biodome really calls these engineered assumptions into question, and that includes the existence of gender roles and sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
