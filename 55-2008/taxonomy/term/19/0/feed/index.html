 <title>Problems with race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/364</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, the representations of gender in the show are pretty sophisticated, I was impressed in that respect.  I&#039;m much less impressed with their treatment of race.  In particular, why are all the most religious characters black?  I&#039;m delving a little into the beginning of season two here, but there&#039;s Roslin&#039;s (spiritual?) adviser (the one who realizes the importance of the 12 serpents),  her guard in the brig, and the quorum member from Gemenon.  It makes me a little uncomfortable...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>deities in &quot;midnight robber&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/303</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting, yet very briefly discussed, differences between the inhabitants born on Toussaint and those whose ancestry traces far back on New Half-Way Tree is the concept of a higher power, the god-figure.  The humans have Granny-Nanny while the douens have Father Bois.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, this difference can be attributed to the realities from which each species originates.  The douen live in a massive tree that provides them with food, shelter, and water.  If the tree did not take on some level of godhood, it would be confusing.  The humans, contrastingly, are in a technological world, where Granny Nanny is literally inside your head, inescapably from birth.  The Eshu in some respects reminded me of angels.  They are the mouth pieces for Granny-Nanny, who is somewhat incapable of directly speaking to the humans (i.e. the eshu are Alan Rickman in Dogma).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something deeper than this, though.  When the humans are sent to New Half-Way Tree, they are very clearly severed from the Granny-Nanny network, yet they still invoke Granny Nanny much the same people in our world today invoke God in times of mild frustration, taking the name as an oath.  Granny does, however, manage to break through the dimensional barrier (again, godlike omnipresence) and implant herself in Tubman, sowing the seeds for a somewhat perverted messianic story.  The fact that Tubman is a child of incest, and thus of only one parental bloodline, also feeds into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The douens, on the other hand, see Father Bois as a benevolent figure who simply nurtures and loves.  Chichibud says to Tan-Tan when he finds her under her dead father, &quot;Papa Bois see what really happen in that room, Tan-Tan.  He ain&#039;t judging you&quot; (172).  When he takes her to the home tree, the incarnation of Papa Bois, Chichibud tells Tan-Tan to come in peace and go in friendship (179).  When the douen feel forced to cut down Father Bois, the tree reincarnates with unbelievable speed, creating a strong sense of the a messianic creature, but different from Tubman.  Where Tubman is a bridge, the tree seems to be what is waiting on the other side of the bridge, the incarnation of the return to paradise when creatures are redeemed from The Fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when Father Bois interacts with the mythic Tan-Tan and Antonio and creates the original Half-Way Tree, there is something vengeful in him at that moment as well.  It seems that there is something inherent to the humans that prevents them from experiencing unconditional benevolence and love from any deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this dichotomy parallels the versions of God in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  The humans are associated with the vengeful, powerful God of the Old Testament, whereas the douen are a far more peaceful people in and of themselves, and thus can better accept and comprehend the loving, forgiving God of the New Testament.  Taking things away from the Christian Bible, the douen also seem to have developed more f a oneness with nature, whereas the humans fight it, and thus incite conflict from the forces that surround and govern them.  It seems that once again man&#039;s inherent hierarchical tendencies and the violence that springs from these tendencies will be his downfall and stumbling block, no matter where he goes or how low he is dragged down.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So I wrote about race.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/267</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Race and racial discrimination are a very large part of Neal Stephenson&#039;s Snow Crash, but they do not manifest in the way we would expect.  In Stephenson&#039;s future world, race becomes defined more by who you work for rather than what your genetics are.  Residents and employees of the various Franchises are granted a sense of exclusive community as per their &quot;citizenship,&quot; and come to distrust and even feud with those from other Franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is genetically half African, half Japanese, and the people he deals with on a regular basis are just as culturally diverse.  Hiro&#039;s very roommate, Vitaly Chernobyl, comes from a very different background:  &quot;Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex-Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev,&quot; (104).  Japanese and Russians have never been on very friendly terms, and I have no idea of the contact levels between Russians and Africans, but I don&#039;t imagine they are long time allies.  Yet the two can get along perfectly fine.  Similarly, Italians and Hiro, Chinese and Japanese, and other individual interracial relationships occur without problem.  This is because racial divisions have moved from original ethnicity to gained citizenship within franchulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most predominant franchise in the novel is The Mafia, an organization unchanged from reality to novel in its power structure.  The Mafia is a very welcoming organization to the individual, evidenced by their advertisements, which portray the head of the franchise, Uncle Enzo, with &quot;his arm around the shoulders of a young wholesome-looking black kid,&quot; or another that says: &quot;NO WAY, JOSÃ‰! Uncle Enzo holding up one hand to stop an Uzi-toting Hispanic scumbag; behind him stands a pan-ethnic phalanx of kids and grannies, resolutely gripping baseball bats and frying pans,&quot; (146).  But when it comes to inter-franchulate relations, the Mafia, like most other franchulates, is not particularly fond of the opposition.  &quot;Most of the franchises are yellow-logoed, wrong-side-of-the-tracks operations like Uptown, Narcolobia, Caymans Plus, Metazania, and The Clink.  But standing out like rocky islands in this swamp are the Nova Sicilia franchulates â€“ beachheads for the Mafia&#039;s effort to outduel the overwhelmingly strong Narcolobia,&quot; (145).  Sure, they could be called rival companies, but their power and operations extend way beyond that of what one would consider corporate.  Franchises even have passports, making them even more like a country than a business:  &quot;They don&#039;t want to let him in.  He flashes his passport; the doors openâ€¦ Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong is an open country, always looking for new citizens, even if they are the poorest Refus,&quot; (328).  Alliances are even formed between them, as the Mafia and Mr. Lee&#039;s people get together in an attempt to overthrow another superpower, L. Bob Rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation of Ethnicity from a biologically determined factor to an issue of allegiances and subscription is an interesting proposition by Stephenson.  People are learning to classify less along genetic lineage and be less racist I feel, but the idea that something will arise to replace this is a frightening idea.  Stephenson seems to be hinting at ingrained structures of hate and rivalry, which are hard to deny, especially when examining our past as a species, but to say that our future just holds more of the same is a rather pessimistic view, and one I hope does not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Race in Cyteen</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/212</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, race in Cyteen seemed to be of absolutely minimal importance.  Surface physical differences deteriorated (or evolved) into genetic ones: the most blatant division within Resuene society is the dichotomy of CIT and azi.  However, I find myself wondering if that division is not just a displacement of race issues.  The azi certainly seem to be the inferior members of this hierarchical structure.  Although they have an important function within the society and do not seem to mind their lower status, they are forced to be servants of the upper strata of CIT&#039;s.  The most constant reminder of this is Caitlin and Florian&#039;s inability (or refusal) to call Ari anything but &quot;Sera,&quot; an honorary term.&lt;br /&gt;
There is also a degree of segregation within the Resuene world: the azi all live down in the &quot;Town,&quot; in barracks separate from the CIT&#039;s whom they serve.  Unless the azi have been chosen to be special servants for a CIT, they live within this segregated world.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, there is another degree of segregation within the azi world--the division of them into alphabetical and intellectual classes.  This division, strikingly similar to Brave New World, offers up another look into segregation within Cyteen.  Maybe it all just ties into what the Oankali think--humans are inherently hierarchical... :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Being Other in the Other&#039;s eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/140</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating interplay between light and dark, and the role of shadows in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot;  Perhaps most interesting is the concept of shifgrethor, a code of honor amongst the Karhidians, which &quot;comes from an old word for shadow&quot; (247).    There is also, among the Handdarata, a focus on the &quot;un&quot;--that which seems to be the opposite of what is.  In many respects, the Karhidians seem to be defined more by what they are not, by what is unseen, and by what traditionally is thought to obscure.  It is a society that thrives through the unknown, through the unspoken (&quot;Secrecy in Karhide is to an extraordinary extent a matter of discretion, of an agreed, understood silence--an omission of questions, yet not an omission of answers&quot; (287.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is just human nature, perhaps it is a result of the weather, perhaps it is a result of a society of kemmering, not static sex assignments.  Whatever the underlying reasons are, though, this shadow life is something that the primary narrator, Genly Ai, does not understand for the bulk of the story, and which separates him from the others around him.  Likewise, this keeps others from truly understanding or questioning him.  It is not until Genly and Estraven have been a long while on the Ice that this cold wall between them begins to break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the text, the reader is presented with Genly&#039;s arguably problematic gendered perceptions of the world around him, ascribing his own frame of reference to a people that defies and in many ways destroys that frame of reference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is also something deeply unsettling about Genly for the inhabitants of Winter.  There is King Argaven&#039;s political fear and distrust of Genly&#039;s differences (34-40), and likewise his physical differences are noted by other characters over the course of his story.  It is not until Estraven and Genly have escaped to the Ice, though, and a friendship based on sheer mutual survival begins to develop, that we get any insight into how Genly is perceived, not as The Alien Envoy, but as an individual who is different.  Estraven&#039;s comments on gender at this juncture are perhaps the most interesting in the entire novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven&#039;s comments on Genly fall into two categories: the physical and the spirit, as it pertains to the body.  When Estraven himself is in kemmer, he reflects on Genly, musing &quot;A strange lowgrade sort of desire it must be, to be spread out over every day of the year, and never to know the choice of sex&quot; (232).    This sentiment seems to get to the heart of the conflict between the two depictions of sex and gender.  Estraven, when speaking of &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; means choosing male or female, not being arbitrarily assigned to one for all of life.  This flux between physical states of being seems to hearken back to the predominance of shadows in the Karhidian culture.  The flux between being sexed and androgynous also bears with it a very strong cycle of emotion, with the intensity of sexuality while in kemmer, and the utter lack of a sex drive when not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet reading the phrase &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; as one Genly&#039;s breed of humanity, I first read it as &quot;the choice to have sex, or not have sex.&quot;  Were the phrase uttered by Genly instead of Estraven, this would be a valid interpretation, as the Gethenians are as captive to their expression of sexuality by time as we are by sex assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven also ties Genly&#039;s sex to his physical and spiritual (not religious, but of the spirit) abilities.  He says &quot;There is a frailty about him.  He is all unprotected, exposed, vulnerable, even to his sexual organ which he must carry always outside himself; but he is strong, unbelievably strong.  I am not sure he can keep hauling any longer than I, but he can haul harder and faster than Iâ€¦To match his frailty and strength, he has a spirit easy to despair and quick to defiance; a fierce impatient courage&quot; (227-8).  Given Genly Ai&#039;s fairly constant comment on the slowness of life, evolution, and time on Winter, Estraven&#039;s understanding of Genly is particularly profound.  He has seen in an example of one what that one could not understand in an entire world.  Yet even this understanding of Genly&#039;s spirit is seen through the filter of the Gethenians.  Where Estraven sees frailty and physical vulnerability, our society has placed virility and strength.  Even when there is a deep personal connection between individuals, they are both still coming to one another from such different perspectives as to never be able to truly understand one another.  Though Genly spends much of the end of the book speaking of the universal human spirit, of &quot;serving Mankind&quot; (293), not just one nation or race, there are still deep differences between the races.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most telling indicator of the split between the Gethenians and Genly is that Estraven, in his times of deep emotion, of mind-connection, and in death, returns Genly&#039;s love for him by displacing his brother, Arek, onto Genry Ai, particularly in the mind-connection, where it is impossible to tell lies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might paint an initially bleak picture of the hope for understanding between Peoples at first glance, in between the arguments, running as a thread throughout, is the desire and hope for understanding.  Though this understanding might be doomed to be imperfect, on both sides, there is the effort, and the emotions created are very real.  We may never be able to walk in the Other&#039;s shoes, but there is the hope of walking along side him, and recognizing that he too must wear shoes, different though they may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much to think about when ur stuck in the ice...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/138</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still interested in what happens in this novel in terms of race, and the representation of racial issues in the future.  We might of tried to touch on it in class, but the overwhelming struggle over the meaning and the philosophy of gender in society was definitely something that took over.  It clearly has for almost all readers of the novel, down to the feminist writers who proclaimed that Le Guin&#039;s use of the male pronoun was the number one most anti-feminist act of all time.  I&#039;m not sure how many people shared my first impression, that race is something of a stagnant, bypassed, non-issue; but as we&#039;ve seen from Starship Troopers, race can be expected to take on a number of different appearances and undergo a number of different transformations in its manifestation in any brave new sci-fi world.  So I was/am suspicious that more is going on here in terms of racial politics than meets the eye.  I&#039;m of the opinion that talking about gender separately from race is inherently problematic, since all aspects of identity (but I would say these two in particular) are inextricable from one another.  They all intersect.&lt;br /&gt;
	Since one of the things that third-wave feminist literature (of member of which group this novel is ostensibly a part, according to its retrospective classification by people other than Le Guin) is reacting to is the failing of second-wave feminist literature to extend a critique of gender to other social structures, I tend to presume a consciousness in the work of the ways in which gender cannot stand alone from an issue like race.  But where do we see this in the work?&lt;br /&gt;
	On the one hand we certainly have some of the Star Trek &quot;federation&quot; model of race-overcome in Le Guin&#039;s universe, at least in the abstract and far-off body of the Ekumen.  Genly&#039;s elegant turn of phrase is not unfamiliar: &quot;we come all colors&quot; (39).  Genly himself is (to me) a typical Le Guin protagonist in that he is revealed to be dark-skinned, presumably of African descent, several pages into the novel.  Surprise, he&#039;s not Caucasian!  I think one of the passing comments in class was very accurate: Le Guin does do a certain recognizable amount of messing with what she knows are going to be the reader&#039;s assumptions, and revealing them to the reader in such a way as to make us unable to deny the systems that inform our reading of any text.  It&#039;s interesting to me here that Genly&#039;s race is one of the &quot;unsettling revelations&quot; she chooses to make, in a style similar to that in which it was casually dropped in that &quot;...even in a *bisexual society* the politician is very often something less than an integral man...&quot; (20).&lt;br /&gt;
	On the other hand, we still have what seem to be remnants of bizarre racial stereotyping worked into the novel, though in some cases I think I&#039;m willing to put it down to less-than-conscious decisions by the author.  I&#039;m not the only person to notice the Gethenian specific inability to differentiate between the &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds, or the Chinese-imperialist-style royal city-within-a-city (as evidenced in various places on the blog so far).  Bizarre referencing of &quot;oriental&quot; stereotypes, it feels like.  These are only a few instances of several when I felt a correlation between a familiar stereotype and Le Guin&#039;s fleshing out of the people of Winter in detail.  There&#039;s also the King&#039;s fascination with not only Genly&#039;s &quot;sexual perversion&quot; but his skin color, which is a troubling icon of difference to the King, alongside Genly&#039;s maleness.&lt;br /&gt;
	It&#039;s also important, I think, to keep in mind the *literal* presence and intersection of race and gender here.  To Genly Ai and the world he represents, the people of Winter are literally a different *race* of human.  The manifested differences in gender and sex, as well as various other less-novel physical traits of the Gethenians are in this way categorized as *race* differences. It&#039;s just an interesting thing to try and pick apart, since the Ekumen feels in many ways like a believable future for humanity.  Race isn&#039;t actually easy to define now, and I could easily see it undergoing a transformation of meaning and definition faced with a new and changing universe.&lt;br /&gt;
	On a slightly different note, I enjoyed the book immensely, especially since its purpose seemed to be to disrupt the reader.  I think I love this book simply as an exercise in breaking down societal givens, rather than a treatise on the inherent nature of man (human) or an attempt to solidify any one problem with modern society by reflecting it in dystopia or utopia.  It&#039;s open-ended, and though we see through Genly Ai&#039;s eyes, it is much easier to experience the world with a sense of wonder and perhaps discomfort that feel much easier to separate from the protagonist&#039;s own rationalization of the world than say, The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, in which we cannot seem to escape Offred&#039;s head and social isolation.  Interesting, since both main characters narrate their own stories precisely as stories, and both tales are conceived of as direct reports which stand as evidence for a past, unreachable experience.  I can&#039;t seem to grasp at why that is, except perhaps that the literal unseating of a gender (or sex?) dichotomy is the more novel to us, the more confrontational and the newest frontier to the reader themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Space-rastas and Doctor Who (aka Response #2)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/47</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just finished reading Neuromancer, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I&#039;ve never read any cyberpunk before, so it was certainly an interesting read.  For some reason I am drawn to the idea of an imperfect future where things are grungy and gross and the people are flawed. I suppose it seems to me like a more realistic version of the future than one in which everyone gets along and there is no poverty and crime (i.e. the Star Trek universe). Perhaps I have little faith in humanity?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple things that interested me in Neuromancer. The first was the role of the Rastafarians. It almost seemed like they were the religious aspect of the story.  At the very least, Gibson certainly seemed interested in bringing certain aspects of that culture into his story.  For instance, there are many references to Babylon. The Founders of Zion are willing to help Molly and Case because they will &quot;bring a scourge on Babylon&quot; and &quot;may serve as a tool of Final Days&quot; (109-110).  In Rastafarian culture Babylon is corrupt society (I suppose in the book it would be the Sprawl and other Earth and non Rastafarian cultures in general), whereas Zion (in the book the home of the Rastafarians) is good. Zion also has connections to Africa which in turn makes me think back to Marcus Garvey and the Back-to-Africa movement. I don&#039;t remember my history too well here, but since the name of the tug was Marcus Garvey I think I am making a valid connection. There was also a connection made between Molly and &quot;Steppin&#039; Razor&quot; which was a song by Peter Tosh who was a reggae musician (109). On the other hand, the Rastafarians seemed rather one-dimensional and stereotypical. They were constantly getting high and spoke with very thick accents and they just didn&#039;t seem to have too much substance.  They&#039;re characters seem set in their ways and just less fleshed out than the others. This has led me to wonder exactly what Gibson&#039;s purpose was in using the Rastafarian culture as part of his story. He delves into many other cultures and subcultures in particular the Panther Moderns, but I&#039;m unclear as to what made him pick Rastafarians in particular as the allies of Case, Molly and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I also really liked the use of technology. It kept amazing me that the book was written back in the early 1980s. The whole concept of the matrix and cyberspace and virtual reality has always been something I thought of a relatively new, so his use of these ideas in the early 80s I thought was very forward thinking. The idea of hacking into systems and spreading viruses seems so current! One thing that I wasn&#039;t too keen on, however, was the all the product placement (for lack of a better term). There was Sony here, Hitachi there, and then there were the little microsoft slivers used by the Panther Moderns.  On the one hand I found this annoying because it made the universe that Gibson created seem less foreign. On the other hand the dominance of certain corporations in the technology industry can&#039;t be denied and the use of big company names seemed to make that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I suppose, I am left with two questions. Why did Gibson choose to use Rastafarian culture so prominently in the novel? While he certainly brings out many aspects of Rastafarian culture and religion, he never goes much deeper into the characters themselves which is disappointing. Second, why the brand names? Was it meant to make a connection between their time and ours? Or to show how technology as an industry is dominated by large corporations? I&#039;m just uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as I was writing this I remembered a Doctor Who serial which features a computer program called the Matrix! In the show it was a sort of virtual reality that a person could &quot;jack into&quot; using a big thing that came down over their head. I&#039;m pretty sure that this episode was from the mid 1970s which would predate the novelâ€¦ interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bugs in Starship Troopers as Nature, not Race</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that it&#039;s a common trope in science fiction for ideas about divisions of race to be transplanted to racial boundaries â€“ as if the authors are saying, &quot;Look, if they can get along with wookies, why can&#039;t we humans all get along among ourselves?&quot; It&#039;s such a common device, in fact, that it becomes difficult to recognize when alien species are actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent ethnicities. However, the Bugs from &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; may actually be something different â€“ for lack of a better term, I&#039;ll describe their presence as a force of Nature, not Race (with a capital R) in the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the relationship between the humans of the Terran Federation and the Bugs doesn&#039;t resemble racial conflict â€“ the only interactions between the two are acts of destruction. Historically, racial conflict doesn&#039;t take the form of immediate, all-out war: the Europeans and American Indians were able to participate in trade and exchange of ideas before prejudice and hatred built up to cause the two sides to begin fighting each other; trade in slaves from Africa was facilitated at least by the cooperation of some leaders within that continent; even the American Civil War was not fought as a battle of &quot;black versus white&quot; at all. However, in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;, the two sides are not just completely at odds with each other militarily: the Terran Federation &quot;[understands] [the Bugs] as little as [it] [understands] termites&quot; (222). The Terran Federation doesn&#039;t even have the faintest idea what the Bugs&#039; motivation is for fighting or when it might be possible to declare peace â€“ they don&#039;t even really know how bugs live, other than the very basics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the bugs and the humans appears most obviously in Johnny&#039;s proof about war as a cause of population pressure: &quot;Either we spread and wipe out the Bugs, or they spread and wipe us outâ€“because both races are tough and smart and want the same real estate&quot; (186). This begins to resemble the conflict between American Indians and Europeans, but in the case of the American Indians, as members of the same species, they ended up becoming somewhat mixed in with the European population that invaded â€“ no such thing is possible (as far as we can see) with the Bugs. The conflict is meant to be seen in a similar situation as that of the &quot;retarded&quot; wildlife of Sanctuary - &quot;When types that had evolved on a planet enjoying high radiation and fierce competition were introduced, the native stuff was outclassed&quot; (155). The humans and the Bugs in &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t communicate, they don&#039;t intermarry and they certainly don&#039;t hold Thanksgiving dinners together before killing each other: they&#039;re opposing species from different environments, and when they come into conflict, it&#039;s kill or be killed.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So a couple thoughts on Heinlein. First of all, although I agree with the below comment that alien races can imply racial connotations, I think that in this case Heinlein used the communal properties of an insectoid race to demonstrate the potential power of a communist social structure in a species adapted to it--and to show it&#039;s fundamental incompatibility with human drives. Second, I think Heinlein&#039;s discussion of the source of political power, though not directly involving race or gender as a major factor, is a potentially useful tool for understanding modern political power relations.&lt;/p&gt;
