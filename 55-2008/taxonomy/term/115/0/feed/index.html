 <title>Buggery in Ender&#039;s Game</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/88</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether anyone else read Ender&#039;s Game with Starship Troopers this semester--or had read it before--but I just read this interesting post on the Feminist SF blog--I was actually linked to it from Paper Cuts--about Orson Scott Card&#039;s winning the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which, I also learned, is some sort of important lifetime achievement award for YA lit. The thrust of the post is that Card is a horrible bigot and shouldn&#039;t be touted as a credible voice for young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a link to the post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot; title=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot;&gt;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&lt;/a&gt;. It has some quotations from essays and stuff that Card has written that are really awful and disgustingly homophobic. If you&#039;re interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, I thought, was this comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i knew he was a homophobe before i read ender&#039;s game, but i still read it on someone&#039;s recommendation. i thought it was pretty interesting that the bad guys were referred to as &quot;buggers&quot; and that it found it&#039;s way to being a slur amongst the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, i know they were &#039;bugs&#039;. but there is no way osc didn&#039;t know what buggery (and buggers) was.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can&#039;t fathom how I missed that one. The phrase is so clearly sexual. And there&#039;s loads of (occasionally naked) homoerotic boy-play in the Battle School. Most of it more or less innocuous, though, which is interesting, given Card&#039;s self-professed beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s anything productive to be done with this in Starship Troopers--the word in Ender&#039;s Game is also clearly a reference to the bad guys in ST--but if anyone wants to take a shot at it, I&#039;d be interested to see what we could come up with, readings-wise.  We talked a lot about gendered readings of ST, but not so much about the potential for queer readings. Not sure how much potential there is, but I thought I&#039;d throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
