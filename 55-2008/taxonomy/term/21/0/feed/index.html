 <title>Cyteen response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/216</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did enjoy Cyteen for the story and the characters, particularly in the development of the second Ariane.  However, much of the politics and the verbal sparring went over my head, and I fear this was a significant portion of the novel.  All of the different alliances and enmities between the major political influences in the novel seemed to change so fast, and often to cues that I as a reader did not pick up for several pages after.  The only point that remained constant was Mikhail&#039;s dislike of both the young and old Ariane, and the need for everyone, everywhere, to watch what he or she says for fear of eavesdroppers.  I would have liked more discussion on the sides for and against the system that includes all of the genetic manipulation and the purpose of the &#039;azi.&#039;  I think the Abolitionists were the major party against this, but I may be wrong.  I guess with the severely limited starting population of a planet, some gene manipulation would have to occur to stop proliferation of genetic diseases and weaknesses, but I was surprised that this was not important to many of the characters of the novel.  It appeared that the people had largely just accepted the changes and experiments, as long as the result was human.  I have trouble believing the lack of controversy here.  I guess the secrecy of the grander experiments done by Ariane and the other top researchers may have helped hide this from the public, but I just don&#039;t think the population would accept this system.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, all this small starting population (meaning limited and often unified viewpoints) and the introduction of the &#039;tapes&#039; seems to have created a society in which this is the norm.  The tapes themselves are also controversial, both the tranquilizings needed to view the tapes and the level on which many of them affect the recipient.  While the ability to learn and remember something very quickly and painlessly would be great, I am surprised that there has been no sabotage.  The talk of a tape &#039;worm&#039; interspersed in the novel introduces the idea of some latent danger from the tapes, but with the way they can affect the most basic logic of human consciousness, I would think there would have been some kind of terrorist or conspiracy attempt by those in control.  On a similar note the azi, particularly Caitlin and Florian, have very little say in what they do, and constantly strive to make their master(s) happy. Perhaps this takeover has already occurred through selective breeding and tape inundation, but in such a way and on a scale as to make acceptable to the public as well.  I would think that some kind of artificial intelligence could do many of the jobs just as well as the azi, while not being requiring all of the birthing and raising process.  A society that has faster-than-light travel should be able to manage this.  There is so much of this absolute control over human life, with cloning, breeding, and rejuve, and it strikes me as odd that there has been so little effort to create trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say, no matter how much I love Heinlein, every time he takes a break from storytelling to shout from a soapbox about his particular political theory, I really want to throw something at him.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>first post</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/19</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So a couple thoughts on Heinlein. First of all, although I agree with the below comment that alien races can imply racial connotations, I think that in this case Heinlein used the communal properties of an insectoid race to demonstrate the potential power of a communist social structure in a species adapted to it--and to show it&#039;s fundamental incompatibility with human drives. Second, I think Heinlein&#039;s discussion of the source of political power, though not directly involving race or gender as a major factor, is a potentially useful tool for understanding modern political power relations.&lt;/p&gt;
