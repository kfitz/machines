 <title>Genetics in Science Fiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/164</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After the brief discussion about genetics in class on Monday, I figured I&#039;d talk about my understanding of the genetics involved and how they would affect Oankali form and society. Although our current understanding of genetics limits our engineering methods to basically linking one gene to a single protein or trait, it&#039;s become pretty clear in the last decade that our genome is much more complicated than that--we are exponentially more complex than a fruit fly, for example, but we have less than double the actual number of genes that a fruit fly has. Clearly, although the physical complexity must be genetically derived, it cannot be purely explained by our current understanding of genomics. Given that, I think it&#039;s fair to allow Butler some wiggle room on the capacity of the Oankali to engineer particular personality traits--things like aggression, caution, violence, sexual drive, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
We seek to assign moral or societal values to the behavior of the Oankali. In particular, their drive to &quot;trade&quot; with species after species seems appalling to us; they seem to genetically pillage other species, imposing their own biological and societal forms. However, attempts for us to place a moral judgement upon that behavior are essentially inappropriate. This drive is a subtle, genetic one; just as we have a basic drive to reproduce on a genetic level, the Oankali enact this sort of genetic colonialism because of a desire, a need that is fundamental to them. To judge them for it is the same as judging humanity for seeking sex.&lt;br /&gt;
The differences between humanity and the Oankali are even more extreme than first appears. Although they appear largely human when amongst us, it must be remembered that their original form was closer to a sea urchin or jellyfish than an ape. Societal forms and moral strictures forming in such a different species would be truly unknown and potentially unknowable to us; the Oankali are truly and completely foreign, from a genetic level up to the extrapolated society, and we must keep that in mind when considering their motives.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drugs and Choice</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/163</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We talked a little bit in class on Monday about the morality of the Oankali.  One of the examples used to make the claim that they are immoral was their lack of concern for the human concept of choice.  Because the Oankali can read into your heads (sense, read, whatever), they have an uncanny ability to know what humans might REALLY want.  Obviously, Joseph&#039;s reaction to ooloi sex is one such instance.  An even more disturbing example is Nikanj&#039;s assumption that Lilith wants a child when she is ready, instantly looking into her thoughts and saying, &quot;I mixed a girl to be a companion to you.  You&#039;ve been very lonely&quot; (Dawn 246).  Obviously, as humans, this strikes us as immoral, partially because it overrides our ability to choose some of our most basic desires--sex, child, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
However, I think it&#039;s really interesting that drugging reappears in Adulthood Rites: not with humans, but between Oankali themselves.  The instance that caught my attention the most is the fight between Akin and the two Construct siblings.  Although Akin initially protests, the girls take him and hold &quot;him between them and put him to sleep...He understood what they were doin and resisted them angrily at first, but they were right...He knew [that he could get them captured], and they could feel his contradictory feelings.  They knew he knew.  Thus, there was no need to argue....He accepted it finally and allowed them to send him into a deep sleep&quot; (Adulthood Rites 395).  This brings up a whole new side to the issue of choice, and I think it&#039;s a good argument for the Amorality rather than the IMmorality of the Oankali.&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t think they were ever trying to destroy the humans&#039; lack of choice: obviously, they made some decisions that we instinctually label as wrong.  However, they were simply acting on their own moral system, drugging the humans as they did each other.&lt;br /&gt;
However, does this make it right? Is it ever possible to judge something completely alien to yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Art, Culture, and Oankali</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/160</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oankali in &lt;em&gt;Lilith&#039;s Brood&lt;/em&gt; are distinctly alien, in many ways â€“ but the difference which persists longest and is most troublesome is their culture â€“ or apparent lack thereof. The Oankali apparently take the view that biology is everything â€“ that, given the scale of a group of humans throughout a lifetime, the genes they have within them ultimately decide the fate of the entires species. They believe that they can predict the lifestyle of the children their ooloi mix before the children are even born. But this sort of dramatically confident view is also one-sided: it ignores the existence of culture, the influence of society, and what Hobbes calls &quot;the Social Contract&quot;. The Oankali perceive a predictability in humans&#039; genetic makeup that persists whether the humans exist in a &quot;state of nature&quot; or not. Granted, the behavior of the humans we see in the book seems &quot;nasty, brutish, and short&quot; except on account of the intervention by Oankali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also suggestions that the Oankali view is not all-encompassing. The Oankali claim that the &quot;Trade&quot; with humans is in part an exchange of cultural practices â€“ but it doesn&#039;t seem like the Oankali have a culture outside of their biology. They have no written records â€“ in fact, they do not wish for Lilith to have writing implements intially, either â€“ but instead rely only on their infallible memories. They have no tradition of fiction, myth, or lying. The closest they come to art is in the shaping of new creatures to serve their needs â€“ and even that seems painfully utilitarian. And even though they claim to be interested in human culture, they really seem to fear it. Take this episode, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left:1em; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding: .5em;&quot;&gt;&quot;The music would soon either drive the storytellers into one of the houses or, more likely, bring them into the singing and dancing. Oankali did not like music. They began to withdraw into the houses â€“ to save their hearing, they said. Most constructs enjoyed music as much as Humans did. Several Oankali-born construct males had become wandering musicians, more than welcome at any trade village.&quot; (Butler 439)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oankali willingly walk away from human culture, ignore it as best they can. They have no use for it. The reasons for this aren&#039;t clear: but my best guess is that it&#039;s not biological enough for them. It is as if the Oankali&#039;s ability to perceive biology so completely blinds them to the worth of non-biological practices. Their ability to communicate directly to one another through sense-tentacles could be related: Akin admits that acting at least is &quot;like when [the Oankali and Constructs] touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (Butler 409). Actually, this description of acting resembles Ursula Le Guin&#039;s explanation of fiction as a method of &quot;describing certain aspects of psychological reality in the novelist&#039;s way, which is by inventing elaborately circumstantial lies&quot; (&lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, Introduction). So if fiction is a method for abstractly conveying difficult information, then Constructs should have no need for it, and in fact this is true. But at the same time, the Constructs enjoy music as much as humans. And even though natural Oankali are not musical, what the Ooloi do is &quot;almost like making music â€“ balancing endorphins, silencing pain, maintaining sobriety... Ooloi made great harmonies, interweaving people and sharing pleasure&quot; (512). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the Oankali, then, biology does not simply replace art; biology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; art, and other forms of art are unnecessary. They do not partake in the trade of books and paintings, and they seem to scarcely acknowledge their value, even though they also claim that human culture is greatly significant. In the end, it may be significant because it is the one aspect of humans they least understand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>alien colonialism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/157</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my reading of &quot;Dawn,&quot; I found myself torn between where my sympathies should lie.  The Oankali seemed compassionate enough and Lilith&#039;s relationship with Nikanj struck me as genuine and surprisingly not creepy.  And yet it is difficult to trust the motives of a group of creatures that put humans asleep for centuries and then keep them trapped in a ship.  There were moments when Lilith&#039;s resistance annoyed me and then at other times I was shocked by her ability to cohabitate with these seemingly grotesque features.  I continually put myself in the position of Lilith and I was forced to acknowledge that I would not be nearly as brave or patient as her.  Being the only human among alien creatures is indeed a terrifying concept.  There was much criticism of Lilith&#039;s decision making in class and I have to argue in Lilith&#039;s defense.  I believe she went above and beyond what the majority of humans would have done in her situation.  Curt may be a brave man in the sense that he is absolutely determined to lead his life away from the Oankali.  But he is also foolish because he never gives the Oankali a chance to prove themselves as decent creatures.  Ultimately I realized that Lilith was such an appealing candidate to the Oankali because she was strong, intelligent and more importantly, open-minded.&lt;br /&gt;
 	Should the Oankali have forced the humans to cross breed with them?  No.  Do I understand why they did it?  Absolutely.  It would be ludicrous for anyone to claim that if a ship full of alien creatures landed on Earth tomorrow, we would not conduct numerous tests on them.  We would of course be fearful but our curiosity would overrule.  I am clearly more hesitant to say that humans would have any desire to mass procreate with them but I would not be surprised if there was some attempt at isolated cross breeding.  The Oankali are naturally very curious creatures.  They are simply fascinated by the race of humans and are eager to save them and then start a future with them.  While they are not open about all their intentions in the beginning, they are incapable of actually lying.  Akin &quot;had always found it easy to tell the truth and difficult to make himself lie&quot; (351).  Humans cannot boast this need for the truth.  &quot;Humans, on the other hand, lied easily and often.  They could not trust one another.  They could not trust one of their own who seemed too close to aliens, who stripped off her clothing and lay down on the ground to help her jailer&quot; (238).  While the Oankali hope to see the good in everyone, humans are  constantly doubtful.&lt;br /&gt;
	Within the first few chapters of &quot;Adulthood Rites&quot; I had my mind set in favor the Oankali.  This is not to say that they did not make mistakes in their handling of the humans.  This is also not to say that they should serve as the epitome of morality.  But I do believe they are a more sophisticated race than the humans in many ways.  They display an inherent goodness that the humans simply don&#039;t have.  One must only look at how welcomed Tino was into the Oankali tribe in comparison to how carelessly and in fact violently the group of nomads treated baby Akin.  His presence excited many humans in Phoenix but this was only because they had desired a baby for so long and at least this one was normal looking.  And still, several of the humans are repelled by Akin because of his gray tongue and thus connection to the aliens.  They refuse to see the Oankali as a race in any way equal to them.  The fact their survival is thanks to these aliens means little to them.&lt;br /&gt;
	I found the story of the merger between the Oankali and the humans as a twisted version of extraterrestrial colonialism.  Here, the humans are essentially the savages who need to be taught how to inhabit the Earth.  However, the Oankali do not behave like traditional colonialists.  They do allow the humans to build their own villages; albeit with the knowledge that they can never have babies.  Rather than exerting violence on the humans, they give people like Lilith defense mechanisms against the humans who will most likely attack her.  This is because they understand humans&#039; inclination towards violence.  Akin describes how the nomads &quot;did hit each other occasionally.  Twice, a pair of them rolled in the mud, punching and clutching at one another.  Even when they did not fight, they cursed each other and cursed him.&quot; (334)  Two centuries after destroying the world through violence, humans still cannot resist the urge for physical aggression.  And yet they still carry the strong need to love and be loved.  Iriarte has great trouble letting Akin go because he reminds him of one of his children.  This is why the humans&#039; dilemma is so problematic and why it is ultimately so difficult to choose sides.  I believe that the humans need to recognize the flaws that almost killed them before and at least attempt to understand the creatures that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hierarchy and the Oankali Contradiction.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My first reactions to Lilith&#039;s Brood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Heriarchy is not a genetic trait.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The Oankali (especially Ooloi) manipulation of humans is immoral.&lt;br /&gt;
3) The Oankali are no more moral than humanity, since both are driven by supposedly inescapable genetic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Hierarchical behavior is too complex to be purely genetic. Unless Butler can point to specific evolutionary pressures that would cause such a trait to occur, I&#039;m going to have to call bullshit on that whole idea. Without that specifically ingrained trait, there is no reason for the Oankali to render all humans sterile (until Jodahs) without an Ooloi. Without that trait human behavior could simply be re-trained. The Ooloi are spectacularly effective manipulators, after all. (I&#039;ll ignore the biological impossibility of heirarchical behavior being genetically inherited in my subsequent points, and instead examine morality in Butler&#039;s universe, where this is true) And that brings me to my second point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Despite the supposed genetic predisposition of the Ooloi to find new things, to heal them, and to bring them in line with their own idea of morality, I think that their extended manipulation of humans is morally suspect. The Oankali as a race, and the Ooloi in general, do not treat humans as if they have any level of choice, and simply manipulate them. They assume that the humans do not have choice because of their biological contradiction, and the Oankali assume they must choose for Humanity. The way that Nikanj uses Lilith, using it&#039;s own pheromones to bind her tightly to it, without telling her about the side effects (She can&#039;t touch Joseph), is presumptuous to the extreme and, I believe, morally wrong. Even worse is Jodahs&#039; unwillingness to tell his soon-to-be mates the same facts, despite seeing how hard it is for his human mother, Lilith, to deal with what Nikanj did to her. He assumes he knows what&#039;s best, he assumes it will be OK, but really all it is is biological greed driving him. Which brings me to my third point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Here&#039;s the Oankali Contradiction: They believe they have the right and the ability to choose for humanity, because humanity is biologically flawed, and the Oankali can &quot;correct&quot; that. But the Oankali themselves are driven by an immensely powerful biological need, that manifests itself in a particular set of morals. These morals are thus no more pressing, no more valid than the supposed lack of morals that the humans exhibit. Both are driven by biology, in this world, and so what we see in the end is a triumph of Oankali biology over human biology, instead of the morally righteous triumph of an angelic race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-CZ&lt;/p&gt;
