 <description>&lt;p&gt;I, too, shall pass...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not understand Delany&#039;s book.  :-(  On the plus side, I like &quot;The Brother from Another Planet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Humanity / Non-humanity / Inhumanity (Delany response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/201</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine out of ten theorists agree: Volition, while constitutive of humanity, leads immutably to anxiety (in the &quot;doomed to freedom&quot; sense), from which it follows that the subversion of volition is simultaneously utopian and dystopian in its socio-political impulse; it liberates us from the burden of assuming autonomous subject positions in the world, but in so doing, it undermines the very core of our being. I hardly need to re-iterate for all of you the difficulties of liberal subjectivity--constantly excercising agency in order to make rational choices, taking steps to get closer and closer to one&#039;s authentic, Platonic Self. The opening scene of Stars in Your Pocket Like Grains of Sand affirms these basic coordinates of humanity: to be human signifies the ability, and the material wherewithal, to achieve more than a monosyllabic response (&quot;yes&quot;) to questions like &quot;Do you choose happiness?&quot;--to realize, in fact, being human means contending with the complexities of this question, even when that process requires flouting happiness as such. (This is why Nietzsche&#039;s &quot;last men&quot; are so nightmarish in their self-satisfied willing of manufactured pleasure: their rallying cry, &quot;We invented happiness,&quot; is monstrously hollow, a slogan of pure jouissance, in which lack and excess fuse perversely and endlessly, without meaning, without humanity.) This opening scene is remiscent of another famous opening from the science fiction canon: the gom jobbar test from Frank Herbert&#039;s Dune, in which the protagonist, Paul, undergoes an evaluation of his humanity, during which he is forced to keep his hand in a pain-generator. What solidifes his human stats--a status that most readers generally treat as immutable, which is partly why the scene is so memorable--is his ability to recognize, but nonetheless withstand, the pain. The metaphyscial claim is equivalent: humanity inheres in the very space of contingency in which &quot;autonomy&quot;--but also pain and suffering--articulate themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both narratives potray heterogeneously comprised landscapes in which Earthly humans are, refreshingly enough, eclipsed by other planets and species. By and large, though, humanity still reigns, albeit in allegorical form, such that questions like, &quot;Are those creatures human?&quot; are replaced by more politically meaningful questions like, &quot;Do the &#039;other&#039; species conform to our standards of (nearly always liberal) humanism?&quot; In this sense, the significance of Delaney and Herbert&#039;s respective work basically conforms to the problematic layed out by Freedman in the Reagan/Terminator article with which the course began: Is the political field presented in [text] humanistic or anti-humanistic--and why should we concerned citizens of the real (i.e., non-textual) world care one way or the other? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll confess my own cognitive dissonance at this point: I find the humanism/anti-humanism binary fascinating, but nevertheless politically bankrupt, since any adjudication between humanistic and anti-humanistic politics seems to delimit in advance (and in overwhelmingly liberal terms) what &quot;counts&quot; as politics. (Note: On this point, I diverge from Freedman. Although undeniable differences certainly exist w/r/t their respective modes and tropes of articulation, I would argue that humanism and anti-humanism simply express the internal split of humanism [much like the &quot;pleasure principle&quot; and the &quot;death drive&quot; are not categorically different types of subjectivity, but rather express the internal split of subjectivity itself], and it&#039;s merely an unfortunate linguistic technicality of Freedman&#039;s argument. I have trouble, for instance, when Freedman claims that humanism is present-tense Utopian in its belief that social problems can be solved by human goodwill, whereas anti-humanism is present-tense dystopian in its belief that Evil is not entirely surmountable--could this not be re-read as an expression of ambiguity w/r/t the temporality of Utopian discourse, i.e., the way in which Utopian imaginaries are inherently futural, and for that reason, necessarily ascribe certain dystopian qualities to the present moment?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said, I&#039;m drawn to, but also put off by, Freedman&#039;s work--and Delaney&#039;s and Herbert&#039;s--because the need to move beyond humanism, in ways that evade what I&#039;m inclined to label as the *totalitarian* pitfalls of post-Reaganite anti-humanism, seems so clearly necessary. One possibility for critical inquiry in this regard lies in the concept of undeath, which plays on the linguistic ambiguity between &quot;non-human&quot; and &quot;inhuman&quot;--whereas the former simply negates the positive content of &quot;humanity&quot; (e.g., alive, conscious, etc.), the latter supplements &quot;humanity&quot; with an excessive, unsettling quality (the inhuman figure is &quot;more human,&quot; in some sense, than the human him/herself). Could we propose something similar with regard to Freedman&#039;s humanism / anti-humanism distinction? What would it mean to explore the &quot;politics of inhumanity&quot; as an explicit antidote to the obverse complimentarity of humanistic and anti-humanism?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the end of days</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/200</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the conception of the Apocalypse in Samuel Delaney&#039;s Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand the most interesting part of the book.  Delaney&#039;s idea of how worlds end is so different from other books and from popular thought. For one thing, it is not really an Apocalypse, an end of days â€“ life, and culture, goes on even after a world has been destroyed by that enigmatic thing, the Cultural Fugue.  Secondly, the world does not end by asteroid collision, or by a trigger-happy country with too many nuclear warheads but by information, and by culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters are a little fuzzy in explaining exactly how information and culture destroys worlds, but it does not sound nearly as flashy.  The closest anyone gets to defining what constitutes a Cultural Fugue, that I could find at least, is when Marq Dyeth says Cultural Fugue happens when &quot;the socioeconomic pressuresâ€¦reach a point of technological recomplication and perturbation where the population completely destroys all life across the planetary surface&quot; (66).  Frustratingly vague for a reader who does not know when the critical point of &quot;technological recomplication and perturbation&quot; is generally reached, and how exactly the population destroys itself.  Would a nuclear holocaust fit under the umbrella of the Cultural Fugue?  Even if it does, it is presumably not the only way, so what other dastardly ways does life have of snuffing itself out?  Are they ways we have not even conceived of yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how exactly life ends, the general threat has been deemed to be information.  Exactly how one deals with such a threat is a major point of difference for the political movements of the worlds, but no one seems to deny that it does pose some kind of a threat.  In the prologue, the Rat&#039;s owner describes the boundless knowledge of General Information, then goes on to say: &quot;Can you imagine?  Living in a world where, if you want to know something â€“ anything, anything at all! â€“ all you have to do is think about it, and the answer pops into your head?  That&#039;s supposed to be how it works.  Even our Free-Informationists are scared to go that far.  They think we&#039;d slide over into Cultural Fugue in a minute!&quot; (24).  People need protection, not from guns or bombs or meteors, but from knowledge, which seems so innocuous in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is that the Apocalypse (I&#039;m not sure what else to call it) is something definite, a real threat that has actually happened in the recorded past and will definitely happen again, somewhere, in the future.  It is not some vague threat that may or may not ever happen.  In addition, the concept of the end of the world is not quite so catastrophic in Delaney&#039;s universe.  If one world ends, there are more around to continue.  They are there to take in the few survivors, mourn the dead, and carry on culture and society.  If my planet were to implode in Cultural Fugue, I wonder whether I would be reassured or annoyed that somewhere in the known universe, everyday life is toodling along, unconcerned with my death.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stars in my Pocket response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/197</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest aspects I found in Stars in my Pocket like Grains of Sand was the difference between modern hunting and the &#039;dragon hunting&#039; between pgs 239 and 257.  At first, hunting in the deserts of Velm appears very similar to our human hunting; leaving for a wilderness area, using large &#039;weapons&#039;, receiving advice over territory or placement from an experienced hunter, and eventually finding and firing at the prey, taking something from the prey in the process. The first major difference here is the wanted result.  While real-world hunters seek to kill the prey as fast as possible and in good enough condition for food, skinning or other purposes, hunters on Velm desire to get a glimpse into the mind of the prey for a time and experience all of its senses.  Instead of taking and using for personal, material comfort or pleasure, the Velm hunter shares the preys&#039; experience, and leaves the creature untouched and completely unaware of the hunter&#039;s intrusions.&lt;br /&gt;
	Neither act is necessary; we have an abundance of food in the USA, and the inhabitants of Velm have many alternate sources of entertainment. Yet, both peoples still do it, and on a fairly common basis.  The Earth style of hunting creates a moral conundrum for the people, but has a more distinct purpose and culture behind it.  Hunting is one f the earliest arts that humanity ever developed; we started as nothing more than hunter-gatherers before tribal society emerged.  Later, at any stage in our progress before agriculture could be instated, or any time we expanded outward to new territory, hunting was a primary means of support.  In short, hunting was an integral part of our humanity, though today it may not be as important as in the developmental periods.  Unfortunately, we are missing one important piece of information:  while our form of hunting was at one time essential to survival in the pre-modern USA, we do not know if the Velm mode of hunting was ever crucial to evelm and/or humans on their planet.  The culture behind hunting is hinted at in the last part of the chapter (pg 251-257) when the narrator goes into depth explaining the importance of Singing after the hunt, but it still appears to be more for entertainment or art than survival.&lt;br /&gt;
	I think the major point here is that we still kill even having moved past the kill-for-food stage, which is both harmful and unnecessary.  We claim it is part of a great heritage, an art that should not be lost; yet with how destructive it is to the prey, is it really justified?  Should entertainment or tradition (since there is no longer necessity) come at such a cost?  It is through these differences between our planet and Velm that the key criticism of our ways appears most clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
