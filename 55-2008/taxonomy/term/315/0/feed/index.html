 <title>The End of the Past and Seeing Beyond</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/336</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I was a bit confused about why The Matrix was our movie to watch with Pattern Recognition, but having thought about it I think there are two major themes that run through both works, though Pattern Recognition clearly tries to stay grounded roughly in the present, while The Matrix extrapolates them to  far more extreme situations. Both works, though, demonstrate the key challenges of defining history, through a character&#039;s ability to &quot;see beyond&quot; reality to some hidden truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that Pattern Recognition is in large part a response to 9/11, and Gibson clearly considers that event a major demarcation of history into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;. To this end, the many cultural references Gibson makes to technology and fashion serve to ground the world&#039;s chronology in a very exact and careful way; while some critics claimed that Gibson&#039;s style in this book would &quot;date&quot; it, this is in fact exactly what he must do to make his point. He is emphasizing that as of now, we cannot tie our culture back to the one of a few years prior, and thus our only way of defining the world is to use whatever cultural markers we have today. The rupture in cultural development has set us adrift, and we have only the most trivial methods of defining ourselves. This &quot;rupture&quot; is immediately obvious in the Matrix as well, where all of human experience hit an abrupt &quot;reset&quot; button, when the world simply became an endless computer simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response to this rupture and lack of total comprehension is a character who understands reality, albeit intuitively rather than consciously, on a deeper level, to see the hidden machinery that most people accept blindly. Cayse and Neo are both heroes in these worlds because they can somehow tap into the forces of the world that would otherwise hinder them: Cayse the cultural flow of trends and fashions, Neo the computer code of the Matrix. While they cannot return to the pre-rupture world, they are nonetheless able to ground themselves in some deeper reality while most people are simply floating through a world newly separated from its own history.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Movies in Pattern Recognition.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/332</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One element of Pattern Recognition that struck me was the use of movie titles or directors in descriptions of both people and places in the novel.  While I did not enjoy the novel much as a whole, I liked how Gibson included these contemporary tidbits of information.  It really helped clear up some of the environments that Cayce was in, and gave the novel a more realistic narrative feel.  I noticed references to The Matrix and to female characters in general in most role-playing games on page 187. And to director Ridley Scott&#039;s sets on page 248.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first, Cayce&#039;s description of Marina, wearing &quot;whatâ€¦is this season&#039;s Prada exclusively, everything black&quot; and looking like she is &quot;Caucasian in some primordial, geological sense&quot; immediately brings black-leathered, pale angular-faced Trinity to mind, even without the direct Matrix reference.  It fits in well with the feelings of &#039;soul-delay&#039; and wide-ranging unreality that Cayce is experiencing here.  Adding to this, Cayce then asserts that, &quot;if her boobs were bigger, she could get work on the covers of role-playing games for adolescent boys of any age whatever.&quot;  I thought this was a hilarious statement, having often shaken my head at the ridiculous proportions and clothes some of the cover woman on those types of games have.  One simple Google search of Everquest, with no mention of cleavage or feminine attributes whatsoever came up with this image including both World of Warcraft and Everquest woman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&quot;&gt;http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/01/wow_eq2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This brought back memories of our class discussions on the first Street Samurai badass Molly in Neuromancer as well.  It is almost as though Gibson is making a parody of Molly here, with her leather pants and dangerous, attractive body.&lt;br /&gt;
	The last reference to Ridley Scott brings up a wealth of science fiction scenes to mind, not the least of which are Blade Runner and Alien.  The &quot;sunlight, shafting dramatically in through a few small holes {in the ceiling]â€¦giving the space the look of a Ridley Scott set&quot; sets the mood for the odd conversation between Cayce and Baranov very well.  The dark, cigarette smoke-filled is transformed with this element included, conjuring images of spotlights illuminating a dirty, futuristic Los Angeles street, or of patches of light shining through the floor grates and air ducts of the Nostromo.  The mood becomes that much more sinister and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Labyrinth of Existenz</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/278</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than talk about the many, many sexual metaphors and images that pop up in Existenz, I&#039;d like to talk about the film in terms of narrative, and its particular brand of alternate reality. This movie was certainly not helped by being released around the same time of the Matrix, since they cover somewhat similar ground, but Existenz is a quiet, low-budget, semi-incoherent techno-horror movie, and the Matrix is the Matrix. But, as alternate realities go, I think Existenz brings up a point that no other book or movie has yet about alternate reality: what if you can&#039;t tell which reality you&#039;re in? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, the Matrix sort of brought up this idea, but it was made pretty clear once people started dodging bullets which was reality and which was manipulable simulation. In fact, Neuromancer and Snow Crash also carry this idea that the mark of the &quot;real world&quot; is a certain powerlessness to natural laws (e.g. gravity); Case diving through 3-dimensional space and Hiro writing code to define the Black Sun are how we know they are in virtual reality. So we come to Existenz, where entering virtual reality give you no superpowers, or really any major distinction between where you were pre- and post-bioport plugging (aside from a narrative shift, which I&#039;ll get to). In fact, (spoilers alert), it&#039;s not even made clear which, if any, parts of the movie take place in reality, so the audience isn&#039;t even given a stable starting point to try and trace the journey between the virtual and the real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cronenberg does seem to offer a brief glimmer of hope, though, in that the narrative of the film seems to devolve as the characters go &quot;deeper&quot; into the game. The story began with a fairly standard plotline--a failed assassination on Character A, who goes on the run with Character B, who doesn&#039;t want to get dragged into all of this.  Willem Defoe&#039;s character is the first indication that this narrative may not be &quot;naturally occurring&quot; in the real world, but is a construction, since the coincidence that Allegra and Pikul would run into a gas station owner who has exactly what they need to advance the story line is a little too remarkable. As the story continues, they enter a game within a game, objects and characters pop up in the wrong &quot;narrative level&quot; (e.g. the tooth gun that was used to shoot Allegra in the first scene pops up again when they are supposedly in the game&#039;s Chinese Restaurant). The film ends with a &quot;realist revolution&quot;, multiple character deaths, and no real explanation of what&#039;s going on. By constructing his film this way, Cronenberg has done with narrative what Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and the Matrix did with surpassing the laws of reality: demonstrated the split between real and virtual. But, the closing scene offers a comprehensive and total &quot;gotcha!&quot; to the audience who think they have finally figured out where the line is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it seems like the &quot;It was all a dream&quot; cop-out, with everyone waking up from their Transcendenz headsets, sans spine-sphincters, laughing about how ridiculous that whole story about Existenz was. But, the closing line of the movie, and a couple of visual cues demonstrate that the game may be able to simulate nice, quiet reality just as effectively as the chaotic, excessive mess we&#039;ve seen for the past hour and a half. Regardless of whether or not you think they&#039;re still in the game at the end of the movie, you still have to force yourself to believe one or the other, because both seem equally plausible. This is ultimately where Cronenberg uses virtual reality to properly pull out the rug, because we finally understand that the distinction between real and virtual will be truly invalid if the real can be perfectly simulated. The notion of &quot;nested realities&quot; becomes terrifying if they are indistinguishable, because there is no way of knowing which is genuine. Even if we think we&#039;ve hit &quot;File&amp;gt;Quit&quot;, or unplugged, or taken off the high-def goggles, there&#039;s no assurance that that too is not just another simulation. Or, to take another tack, if they&#039;re indistinguishable, does it matter if we&#039;re in the real world or not?&lt;/p&gt;
