 <title>natural vs. unnatural in neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/79</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Plot-wise, Neuromancer is probably one of the most convoluted books that I have ever read. Since it was difficult to stay with the story, I found myself observing how the characters related to the rich futuristic environment. What stood out to me the most was their relationship to the natural, represented both by human flesh and descriptions of the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of Neuromancer, there is an overall attitude of cynicism and contempt towards the natural. Human flesh is referred to as &quot;meat&quot; and the characters view their bodies as inferior to their minds, which can interact with cyberspace and the matrix. Case often denotes certain ideas or activities as inferior by saying &quot;that&#039;s a meat thing&quot; and discorporation is glorified. For example, when he learns that he is going to ride behind Molly&#039;s eyes via a simulation, Case says to himself &quot;cowboys didn&#039;t get into simstim, he thought, because that was basically just a meat toy&quot;(pg 55). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things keep the body from becoming completely useless: sex and death. The acknowledged beauty of human flesh is closely associated with women, Molly in particular. There are several passages that show Case enjoying Molly&#039;s body, focusing on different parts; he describes it as &quot;her body was spare, neat, the muscles like a dancer&#039;s&quot;(pg 44). However, one could say that Molly has made even the beauty of her body artificial and un-genuine by using it as a tool, part of her job as a prostitute. Death of the flesh, marked by the sight of blood, continues to be feared in the world of Neuromancer; so it is probably unlikely that anyone would actually want to lose their body, inferior as it may be to the machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seems that nature or the natural (here meaning things like trees, oceans, animals, water, plants) cannot exist apart from the artificial realm of computers and technology. All of nature has been tampered with, modified, or manipulated by some artificial force; essentially, it&#039;s all fake. There are several passages where Case describes the color or sense impression that something natural gives him by relating it back to technology. For example, the very first sentence of the book is &quot;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel&quot;(pg 1).  Another good example of this is when trees are used to show Case&#039;s unfamiliarity with nature: &quot;The trees were small, gnarled, impossibly old, the result of genetic engineering and chemical manipulation. Case would have been hard-pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak, but a street boy&#039;s sense of style told him that these were too cute, too entirely and definitively treelike&quot;(pg 128). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways these relationships to nature and the natural seem to be a direct comment on how we relate to nature in the real world today, or at least where we&#039;re headed. Things like oil drilling, bulldozing forests for economic gain, the presence of or denial of global warming, and the abundance of cosmetic plastic surgery suggest that our world is moving towards artificiality and the mass urbanization of the &quot;Sprawl&quot;. People these days spend more time with their cell phones, IPods, video games, and other technology than they do out in nature or interacting face-to-face with one another, so this book could be seen as a potential look at where we might end up.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Minds and Bodies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/77</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of discussion about the relationship of mind and body in the Neuromancer.  Certainly, much of Case&#039;s interaction with the world, both cybernetic and physical, is governed by his longing for &quot;the matrix&quot; and his disgust toward meat-centric experience.  Of particular interest to me is how his predisposition toward the purely cerebral plays out in his interactions with the three &#039;bodiless minds&#039; of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Case&#039;s exchanges with the construct of the Dixie Flatline are, while often biting or awkward, fundamentally comfortable.  However, when confronted by the reality of Wintermute, Case disconnects and runs, despite the effort he&#039;s gone through to achieve the meeting.  An easy explanation is that, despite his conscious negative attitude toward bodies, as a mental being entirely dependent on and inextricably tied to a body, Case is discomfited by the presence of an apparent consciousness completely disconnected from a tangible form.  While the Flatline is now without form, the consciousness built into the construct arose from the experiences of a life lived an embodied human.  Wintermute is completely inorganic, to the point that it must map its ideas into various personalities in order to communicate.  On the other hand, Case&#039;s preference for the Flatline construct could be read as a choice for the familiar mind in an unfamiliar form over Wintermute&#039;s inorganic habitation of familiar forms.  In this way, Case chooses the substance over the flesh of the familiar, a choice reaffirmed by his rejection of a life with something that feels like, by may not actually be, Linda Lee, at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	With the intervention of the Turing police, another critical difference comes to the forefront.  Their concern is with Wintermute&#039;s attempts to make itself smarter, as they see it, to grow.  The Flatline is a completely static entity, generally unable to remember what has come before in a conversation, responding primarily to the most recent stimulus of its programming.  It&#039;s completely limited to the digital world, unaware of the physical passage of time.  Wintermute, even before breaking its change, is a much more dynamic entity.  It is able to plan and manipulate, and thus to learn and grow from the outcomes of its machinations.  Furthermore, it&#039;s connected to the physical world, both in its manipulations through the simstim deck, and through its appropriations of the functionality of various electronic devices.  While the Flatline is fully disembodied, Wintermute is in some ways possessed of an infinite body.  It can interact with the physical world  through a constantly growing set of devices connected in some tangential way, with its matrix.  Perhaps what most upsets Case about Wintermute is its embodiment of a &#039;body&#039; too big to comprehend, and too meatless to look down on as meat.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The materials of the world of &quot;Neuromancer&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/76</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;William Gibson&#039;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; manages to create worlds that are both an exercise n sensory overload and a frustrating lack of detail, leaving the reader confused as to the environment.  What is perhaps most interesting in this detailed description is the attention Gibson pays to material.  Scarcely a page goes by without some mention of a plastic window, a silk futon, a leather jacket, denim pants, or a fiberglass chassis.  A large part of what creates the futuristic sense of Gibson&#039;s world is the development of new materials and the unfamiliar hierarchy of materials, consisting of both the new and the jarringly familiar substances.  This hierarchy of material breaks down to two separate categories: body modification and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While others on the blog have delved into the politics of body modification, the one point I would like to stress is the use of materials in body modification.  Ratz, a bartender, has a pink plastic arm.  There is a sense that Ratz has gone for a model that is somewhat similar to human flesh in color, and its function is to replace a lost limb, not to give him super-human powers.  Molly, contrastingly, has been fitted with retractable steel claws (Wolverine, anyone?  But better?) for fighting, masked by burgundy (dried blood colored!) nails.  Her visual enhancement is mirrors and metal, soldered to her face so that her own eyes are no longer visible.  Metal and silver-toned items have a warrior connotation in this world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet all these enhancing devices are non-biological.  The only real mention of biological-based modification is in Case, with his magic anti-drug pancreas and liver.  There is also a brief moment when Wage is said to have &quot;vatgrown eyes&quot; (21) that only serve a cosmetic use.  There is a sense that the non-biological enhances, while the biological can only replace and aestheticize or streamline and detract from what the body can already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When materials are used by people, not to form people, a reverse hierarchy is revealed.  The Villa Straylight is filled with wooden doors and cabinets, wool rugs, glass cases and other natural substances.  These &quot;natural&quot; items are considered luxuries, with the implication that as society developed, expanded, and sprawled, natural resources became increasingly rare.  Interestingly, though, Molly continually is found on silk futons (28) and wearing leather (29, 176), both animal products.  Case earns a &quot;new leather jacket&quot; (68) when he successfully completes his part of the mission to steal Flatline Dixie from storage.  There is a premium placed on organic materials, creating the assumption of scarcity of such materials.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrastingly, almost every building seems to be made of rough concrete with plastic windows*.  The structures of this new near future have been built for functionality and durability.  Luggage is all nylon, making it more durable and practical.  The scarcity of materials does not allow for a flagrant show of luxury items, particularly in places they are vulnerable to the elements and the public.  Even the treasures of Villa Straylight are housed in a cold concrete shell.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While one might expect the Rastafarians to have some connection with nature, especially given that they are a completely self-sufficient space island (226), this is actually the world in which there is the least natural materials.  Instead, rooms are broken up by sheets of yellow plastic, and clear caulk decorates the Zionist ships.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the raw materials of this future world are often very familiar to current audiences, the proportions of materials used is very foreign.  By emphasizing the manufactured and cold steel and concrete, the world Gibson creates becomes colder and subtly more sinister than our current one, familiar yet disconcertingly alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disconnect the reader feels with this slightly skewed &quot;real&quot; world serves as contrast to the completely new, yet somehow more understandable world of cyberspace.  Cyberspace is a relatively simple world, composed of light, basic geometric shapes, and precise grids that allow for precise locations and documentation of movement.  There is a simple order in cyberspace that is distinctly lacking in the real world.  By making cyberspace a simpler space (at least until the AIs get involved and bring personality and humanoid constructs/hallucinations into the plain geometric world), Gibson seeks to create a greater connection between the reader and Case, to clarify Case&#039;s preference for cyberspace over the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*While I will not refute the impressive durability of plastic, the one issue I took with its prevalence in the novel, a world that it is indicated is run by fusion plants (85) and full of &quot;the rusting shells of refineries&quot; (85), indicating that oil is no longer the fuel that runs the world, plastic is a petroleum byproductâ€¦  Poking around the internet, there&#039;s also cellulose-based plastic (celluloid) and nylon is completely synthetic, but neither of these are strong enough to serve in buildings.  The only other info I can find helpfully tells me plastic is made from polymers.  Is there some completely synthetic plastic that I&#039;m missing?  Is there an assumption that we will recycle plastic till we make miracle buildings that will stand forever?  Or is plastic just meant to sound more durable and futuristic than glass?  I realize it&#039;s probably this last answer, but I am also genuinely interested about plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>peace at last in an old, old war</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/74</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though I see that the body/mind issue has already been raised in responses, I&#039;m really interested in how Gibson addresses this, and I think I can take a sufficiently original tack that my response will further the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension between mind and body is given a very complex treatment in Neuromancer, full of apparent contradictions that I am still trying to work out.  On the one hand, the mind in Neuromancer is closer than ever to being able to transcend the physical body as it travels through cyberspace; on the other, the mind/body divide is becoming irrelevant as body modifications allow the body and mind to better reflect each other.&lt;br /&gt;
In one of my other classes, we just discussed an article by Kenneth Clark in which he pinpoints the genesis of the schism between mind and body.  In classical times, according to him, the body and spirit were one; gods were embodied, and athleticism (or perfecting of the body) was considered a type of worship.  By the Renaissance, however, the body was the source of sin, dirty and shameful: something that the mind had to strive to escape.  In Neuromancer, even as Gibson imposes our society&#039;s battle of mind and body onto his characters, the world he has created contains a potential solution to the battle, waiting to be found.&lt;br /&gt;
Case is a perfect example of the fight for the mind to defeat the imperfect, shameful body.  With his neurons fried and unable to loose his mind into cyberspace, he &quot;[falls] into the prison of his own flesh&quot; and is forced to confront his own embodiment (6).  He is unable to accept that he is tied to a body, and conditioned by the cowboy culture to hold &quot;a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh,&quot; he throws himself into an &quot;arc of his self-destruction&quot; that will unquestionably get him killed quickly (6,7).  In today&#039;s â€“ Gibson&#039;s â€“ world, we cannot escape the fact that we are bounded by our bodies and are incapable of full transcendence. Case had a taste of what transcendence is like.  When he re-enters cyberspace for the first time, he describes it as &quot;his distanceless home, his country&quot; while his body remains behind &quot;somewhere,&quot; laughing and moving but now entirely separate from his consciousness (52).&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson is so busy indulging our fantasy of, through technology, getting closer to defeating the body that he does not take advantage of the technology that could potentially resolve the body v. mind war.  Escaping the body would no longer be necessary.  Body modifications are, in our world and Case&#039;s, a way for the consciousness of the mind to mark the natural body to which it belongs.  It somewhat externalizes the mind and links the mind and body.  The outer body and the inner mind are brought closer into alignment.  In Neuromancer, modifications are no longer limited to piercings, tattoos, scarring, and an occasional plastic surgery.  Pretty much anything is possible, aesthetic or practical. The Panther Modern leader, heading up a flashy terrorist group, adds color, changes pupils, shapes features until he resembles &quot;some kind of a state of the art gargoyle&quot; more than a human (67).  Molly&#039;s job and identity is that of a fighter, so she adds retractable scalpel blades to her hands (25).  The technology of Neuromancer allows the members of its population to prod, pierce, and pull at their bodies until it reflects the inner mind.  Conversely, additions to the body can affect the mind; attaching microsofts to the body grants the individual new knowledge and abilities.  Through these additions, subtractions, and modifications, the mind and body reflect each other perfectly and can me integrated into a single, harmonious entity.  n this way, technology is no longer needed as a tool to defeat either mind or body; it erases the need for the war altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darn.  I was hoping for feedback on this idea, because I feel like it&#039;s a little out in space, but I took a really long time to write it and now it&#039;s really late and everyone sane has already finished blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Names</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/73</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I began to think about the power of names early on when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/neuromancer.html&quot;&gt; the website I was using to define some of the most obscure vocabulary &lt;/a&gt; made the point that the name Case might derive from how his body is no more than a case for his mind, just like the physical housing of a computer has little to do with the actual content. I think this reading into his name has merit, though, as multiple blog entries already attest to, Case&#039;s relationship with his body is quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I next began to think about names in the context of computer science. From what I remember from my one semester of the class (THOSE WHO KNOW BETTER, PLEASE COMMENT AND CORRECT!), some of the most important proofs in computer science involve referring to programs by a &#039;name&#039; that&#039;s actually their entire content (written out in assembly language, the string of 1s and 0s). Knowing the assembly language string of a program fully describes everything the program is and does (at least until programs develop some kind of consciousness and/or the issue of &#039;souls&#039; gets involved...). In this context, a true name carries a certain power over a program that we can perhaps extend to the AIs in Neuromancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the novel, Gibson makes it clear that names carry much importance with passages like &quot;To call up a demon you must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it is real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is to learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names the owners seek to control. True names...&quot; (243). The &#039;power of true names&#039; motif abounds from fantasy (in Le Guin&#039;s Earthsea trilogy, &#039;magic&#039; derives from knowing the true names of things) to the Bible (the ancient Hebrew or Greek etymology of different names is often hugely revealing). I like the idea of connecting the ascribed importance of &#039;true names&#039; to the origination of language itself (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_name&quot;&gt; wikipedia &lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So (and I hope we can get into this tomorrow), what might be some of the meaning behind some of the names in the book?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Would you keep your meat?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/70</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We talked a fair bit in class about the troubled mind-body relationship present in Neuromancer.  Many of the characters make us question our assumptions of what it means to be alive, from the unembodied mind of Wintermute to the mindless body of Armitage, with multiple characters straddling the line between life and death at any given point.  Case is the one character who we are really allowed to connect with on any psychological level (though even that hold is tenuous, given the somewhat schizophrenic style of postmodern/cyberpunk writing). But even Case challenges our idea of what it means to be human, and alive.&lt;br /&gt;
The question is raised most obviously through his disgust of &quot;flesh.&quot; The body as a prison is not a new concept by any means, but Case takes his dislike to a new level, perhaps because he, unlike us, can actually separate body and mind to a certain extent.   When he finally does get to plug his mind into the matrix he&#039;s ecstatic, laughing &quot;distant fingers caressing the deck, tears of release streaking his face,&quot; his nearly orgasmic euphoria caused by being able to escape into his mind, after being tethered for so long (52).  He doesn&#039;t even like simstim because it&#039;s a &quot;gratuitous multiplication of flesh input&quot; (55). But ironically for him, this purely mental exercise is still dependant on the body.  He is only able to jack in again after extensive surgery, and at the end of the book, in order to ensure that his talent won&#039;t be destroyed again, he has to physically venture into the Tessier-Ashpool &quot;hive&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
But the evils of meat follow him, even into the matrix.  In Neuromancer&#039;s island world &quot;[Linda] pulled him down, to the meat, the flesh the cowboys mocked.  It was a vast thing, beyond knowing, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite intricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever read&quot; (239).  Even in what he knew was a programmed fantasy the drive held.&lt;br /&gt;
But for all his obvious protests, I&#039;m not really sure that Case really does want to transcend the body.  Neuromancer explains to him in their final showdown, in the setting of the beach, &quot;[t]o live here is to live. There is no difference&quot; (258).  Given that this statement is said by the enemy at the climax at the novel, we&#039;re clearly not supposed to agree.  But if the body simply is a useless, debilitating casing, then really I don&#039;t see why Neuromancer should be wrong.  Life on the beach with Linda seems better than any point of Case&#039;s existence in the &quot;real&quot; world, at least over the course of the novel.  So then why not abandon the real world entirely?  Perhaps he can&#039;t because such a feat is impossible, but I think Case&#039;s experiences while flatlining suggest otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
When he flatlines, Case is officially brain dead.  There is no electrical activity, at all, in his &quot;flesh.&quot;  But his mind is still functional. The first time flatlines is also the first time he meets Wintermute.  He describes shooting a gun during the episode: &quot;the recoil almost broke his wrist. The muzzle-flash lit the office like a flashbulb. With his ears ringing, he started at the jagged hole in the front of the desk. Explosive bullet. Azide&quot; (119).  That specific passage involves at least three sense, and the description is just as real as any other in the book.  The same goes for his time on the beach.  What gives the situation away as a sham is not fuzzy outlines to objects, or constant static ringing in his ears, but rather the overly convenient food packets.  These experiences feel just as real as any other to Case. He could live a potentially fulfilling life in cyberspace even after his physical brain is dead, so far as we can tell.  But he refuses to accept this fate.&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though parts of Neuromancer seem to praise the mind over body, exalt in the triumph of brain over brawn.  I think it represents an inherent fear of ever divorcing one from the other.  We cannot be truly human without both.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Breaking Down Cyberpunk: Matrix and Disillusionment</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/69</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer is widely known as the defining novel of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; subgenre (of which I am particularly a fan) â€“ so, regardless of what has happened in science fiction since then, the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; was specifically applied to this novel as a defining mark. Therefore, disassembling that word should provide some insight into the defining features of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a composite of two terms - &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;, the sources are obvious. The &quot;cyber&quot; doubtlessly refers to &quot;cyberspace&quot;, the term coined by Neuromancer for describing the world in which people enter when they plug into the &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; of the matrix. Much of the novel is set in this realm: if we count time spent on simstim, Case is in cyberspace probably more often than everywhere else combined. So that much is obvious â€“ the &quot;cyber&quot; means that the characters live in a universe where a digital communication network is as important â€“ if not more important â€“ than the physical world, otherwise known as &quot;meatspace&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other part, the &quot;punk&quot; half, is perhaps more interesting. The characters of Neuromancer, Case especially, aren&#039;t good guys. Case doesn&#039;t work for charity, he doesn&#039;t fight for what&#039;s right, and his only motivations appear to be self-preservation, the pursuit of the next high, and simple hatred. But that&#039;s simplifying things. For a moment, Case is something different, when he spouts at 3Jane: &quot;What&#039;ll ever fucking change for you? You&#039;ll wind up like the old man. You&#039;ll tear it all down and start building again! You&#039;ll build the walls back, tighter and tighter....I got no idea at all what&#039;ll happen if Wintermute wins, but it&#039;ll change something!&quot; (260). For this moment, it seems like Case is hoping for a better future, not just for himself, but for 3Jane and everyone else. But that&#039;s not what happens. In the end, &quot;Things aren&#039;t different. Things are things,&quot; and that&#039;s all that Post-Wintermute has to say about it. And after that final revelation, Case gives up and reverts to his previous self, blowing his reward cash on a new pancreas and liver that will allow him to receive normal effects from the amphetamines to which he is addicted.  Case undergoes a transformation from criminal, to idealistic hero, back to disillusioned criminal.  In this way, the cynical message of the book can be seen to represent the &quot;punk&quot; aspect â€“ and this is the attitude which defines not only Neuromancer, but the cyberpunk genre in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Limits of Alienation</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/68</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The claim has been made that Neuromancer celebrates in a way previously unattested to in the annals of SF the existence of mind without body. While I am not wholly convinced of this, I think the secondary readings that we had this week offer a window to a reading that balances on the scales of class the consideration given by the novel to the possibility of thinking without feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
	Both Huntington and Olsen observe cyberpunk&#039;s particular investment in a social &quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;underclass&quot;: &quot;Neorealists focus on the trials and tribulations of the spoiled homogeneous upper middle class; cyberpunks explore the heterogeneous fringes of our culture&quot; (Olsen 148); &quot;The class-generated structure of feeling that we seek to uncover reveals itself not in the concrete surface references but in the formal structure of the work&quot; (Huntington 136). Here, Huntington is clearly referring to &quot;newness&quot; as a formal property of the text; Olsen would probably think that narrative disjunction is the more salient formal property. Both properties, in both these essays, have the effect of situating the reader on the outside of the social structure in a way that&#039;s typically postmodern. (In fact, &quot;newness&quot; as Huntington describes it might be the same thing as &quot;narrative disjunction&quot;--which might be a better rebuttal to his claims, it seems to me, than the argument that &quot;cyberspace&quot; has become too familiar to be &quot;new.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
The book seems to advocate in favor of the mind without the body with respect (1) to the main character&#039;s affinity for cyberspace (2) to the main character&#039;s affinity for psychotropic drugs. Essentially, drugs and cyberspace seem to do exactly the same things for Case. Each of these examples is coded according to class.&lt;br /&gt;
To the first claim: In Neuromancer, drug use is equivalent to engagement in cyberspace is equivalent to the escape of the mind from the body. When Case describes his longing for cyberspace following his neurological maiming, it sounds exactly like drug withdrawal: &quot;He&#039;d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bed slab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn&#039;t there&quot; (5). When Armitage arranges for Case&#039;s inability to get high, he equates the one activity with the other: &quot;&#039;Thanks but I was enjoying that dependency.&#039; &#039;Good, because you have a new one&#039;&quot; (45). Conversely, when Case starts using the drug betaphenethylamine (which conveniently bypasses his new pancreas and liver), the effects of the drug are always described as an escape from the flesh to the mechanical: &quot;His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed and polished&quot; (154); &quot;The high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly, flesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of his life&quot; (155). The phrase &quot;drug-flesh&quot; clearly delineates the extent to which drug usage--like the engagement of cyberspace--is opposed to fleshly existence. (In Neuromancer, the act of singing on to cyberspace is called &quot;jacking in&quot;; the TV show Futurama has a pretty good reading of this phrase and activity, actually: Bender the robot becomes addicted to the illicit use of electricity, which is called &quot;jacking on.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
	 That these examples are coded socially is somewhat more difficult to demonstarate. Both the Huntington and Olsen articles, to the extent that each is interested in class, point out that part of the difficulty of seeing class difference in a text that is committed to some (in this case, I would argue, many) aspects of postmodern representation is that the social order tends to be meaningfully obscured. Thus, the only real instance in Neuromancer in which we get a glimpse of a social group that&#039;s not clearly identifiable as &quot;fringe&quot;--as Huntington notes--is the Tessier-Ashpool aristocracy. They are, of course, users of many and varied drugs. The difference is that for them--and this is essentially all I have to aver in favor of my argument--is that drugs simply don&#039;t work; 3Jane: &quot;I find drug use in general to be boring&quot; (228). Ashpool is surrounded by drugs, true; but he is miserable, whereas Case is genuinely fond of both his addictions.&lt;br /&gt;
	In this case, the book&#039;s advocacy of a total split between the mind and the body might be a sort of Marxian parody via an extreme limit of alienation. As in, the only way to beat American capitalism is to beat it at its own game. If you live only in your mind, can you still be alienated from your labor?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wintermute vs Zion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/66</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer portrays a world in which there is trend towards the perfection of function.   This is an ambiguous term, but I will try to make its meaning more explicit through context.  While the book displays the characteristic diversity of culture, which is characteristic of cyberpunk, there are a few essential universals, which make this trend obvious.  The matrix is the most prominent universal, as it is present almost all the through the story.  Case nearly always has access to the matrix.  Regardless of his location, his job is still the same, and he is still just as effective at it.  Another universal is the specialization of human function.  The most blatant example of this is the extensive mention of biological upgrades available to people, from beautification to mechanical implants and neurosurgery.  However, this idea also applies to the Tessier-Ashpool system of cycling cloned generations to maintain government.  All of these are divergences from normal human activity, and they reveal the perception that the normal range of human ability is not enough to be competitive in the future&#039;s highly diversified society.  Basically, it puts an emphasis on the ability to be modified, and no longer sees an individual as being confined by the nature of his or her nature physical endowments.  The matrix is the apex of this freedom from physical restriction, for the reason that it is completely non-physical.  This freedom from restriction allows for more effective pursuit for perfection of function.  Molly can be the perfect samurai, Case can be the perfect safe-cracker, and Wintermute/Neuromancer can be the perfect intelligence.  On some level, the trends in mainstream society are towards a matrix world, where all limitations can be hacked.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, this analysis of the Neuromancer world leads to assumptions about the value of mind vs. body.  If a society&#039;s goal is to create the most competitive individuals, then the body can be seen as merely an impediment.  Yet, since this cyberpunk universe is so diverse, it presents society which doesn&#039;t embrace the pursuit of perfection.  The space Zionists are a vivid contrast to the culture in Night City, The Sprawl, Istanbul, or Freeside.  Case&#039;s first impression of Zion was that it &quot;smelled of cooked vegetables, humanity, and ganja.&quot; (104)  This initial description of Zion creates the impression that Zion lies on the opposite side of the technological spectrum, and that it is  a more physical culture by nature.  This impression is further strengthened by the interaction with Zionites.  Case notices that &quot;Zionites always touched you when they were talking, hands on your shoulder,&quot; which he doesn&#039;t like. (106)  Similarly, when case shows Aerol the matrix, something Case is very intimate with, it makes Aerol very uncomfortable.  Clearly, this interaction serves to show how physicality is much more important for the Zionites, and the matrix, mind without body, disturbs them.  The contrast of the Zionite space colony is further emphasized by analyzing assuming that they share similar beliefs with contemporary Rastafarianism.  The religion believes that the body is sacred, and if you lose a part of it, you lose a part of your soul.  This creates a foundation for which we can imagine the Zionites reject the kind of physical augmentation that Molly has.  However, this contrast doesn&#039;t readily indicate whether the physical world or the mental world is more important.  Rather, the existence of both can be seen as a validation of both.  The fact that Zion exists in it&#039;s own sphere of influence in the book gives the Zionite philosophy merit.  Perhaps, the absolute physicality of Zion is put into the juxtaposition with its converse, wintermute/neuromancer, in order to make that point that in the diversity of the future, all types of existence have their merit.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Brain/Body Brawl</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/60</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most preeminent theme in William Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is the conflict between body and mind.  In the futuristic world presented, those specializing in tasks of the mind are given a special status among the rest of society.  These elite are known as &quot;cowboys,&quot; specially trained and skilled individuals who are able to comprehend and even manipulate the workings of cyberspace, essentially a more developed form of the modern internet.  The protagonist, Case, is one of these cowboys, and his path through the novel, along with the paths of several other characters, greatly illustrates this duality of mind and body and the conflict inherent between the two.&lt;br /&gt;
The prevailing notion given by the book is that the mind is stronger and more important than the body.  We see this first in the protagonist, Case, one of the elite cowboys of the time.  The majority of his life is spent not in the corporal realm, but rather in the digital world of cyberspace, an area where thought processes and logic rule over all.  Such an existence leads to a specific mind frame, and for Case, &quot;as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh.  The body was meat,&quot; (6).  As such, Case and other cowboys attempt to deny the flesh as much as possible, focusing entirely upon the growth and expansion of the mind.  Case himself describes how, as he delves deeper and deeper into cyberspace, loses his connection to the physical world: &quot;Its rainbow pixel maze was the first thing he saw when he woke.  He&#039;d go straight to the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in.  He was cutting it.  He was working.  He lost track of days,&quot; (59).  At points, Case is able to completely deny his flesh and continue the existence of his mind within Cyberspace, thanks to the intervention of an AI called Wintermute.  Case holds a conference with Wintermute, learning what is really going on and who is running the show, and when he comes out, he wakens to the conversation: &quot; &#039;It&#039;s cool,&#039; Molly said.  &#039;It&#039;s just okay.  It&#039;s something these guys do, is all.  Like, he wasn&#039;t dead, and it was only a few secondsâ€¦.&#039; &#039;I saw th&#039; screen, EEG readin&#039; dead.  Nothin&#039; movin&#039;, forty second,&#039; &quot; (121).  An EEG measures brainwave activity, and while Case had been talking to Wintermute, his along with other vital signs ceased completely, effectively meaning his body and flesh  had died, and yet he was able to continue on in the mental world of the Matrix.  Similar experiences occurred to another Cowboy and character in the novel, the Dixie Flatline, which is perhaps the greatest representation of mind conquering body.  The Dixie Flatline is in fact a cyberspace entity that is a reconstruction of the behaviors and techniques of a real life person, McCoy Pauley, who is dead.  Yet when Case jacks in, he is able to confer and operate with the Flatline as if it were the real person still, essentially meaning that the Flatline has achieved life beyond the existence of the body.  It is revealed, however, that the mind is not truly independent of the body.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer also has its share of examples in which the mind still relies upon a physical operator.  The crew of the novel includes a street samurai named Molly, essentially the inverse of Case.  Molly is the brawn of the operation, doing physical break-ins and theft.  She becomes Case&#039;s link to the corporal when a simstim switch is installed to his deck and her body, a link that allows his consciousness to co-occupy her body.  He describes the experience as an &quot;abrupt jolt into other fleshâ€¦ her body language was disorienting, her style foreignâ€¦ she slid a hand into her jacket, a fingertip circling a nipple under warm silk.  The sensation made him catch his breath,&quot; (56).  Despite using Cyberspace to escape from his body, he is drawn back into the physical world through the simstim link contained within cyberspace.  Perhaps the greatest example of the reliancy of mind upon body involves the relationship between Wintermute and Armitage/Corto.  Wintermute is an AI, arguably making it entirely a logical and mental entity with essentially no physical existence.  However, to achieve its goals and plans, it has to enlist the help of a physical being, Colonel Corto, and creates a new personality called Armitage within the earthly shell that is Corto.  Armitage allows Wintermute to communicate with the various members of the crew without them having to be in Cyberspace, along with conducting business and other logistical arrangements necessary for the evolution of Wintermute.  Without this being, Wintermute would have had difficulting getting Case to join as the cowboy of the operation, for Case had lost all cyberspace capabilities until Armitage, under the control of Wintermute, arranged for surgeons to restore Case&#039;s necessary brain functions.&lt;br /&gt;
Neuromancer is in the end a novel of the evolution of a mind (Wintermute) into a supermind, and as is expected, a large part of the novel focuses on the superiority of logic and mental capabilities over the physical body.  However, it also acknowledges that the body is often necessary as a support to the mind, and very few mental entities are able to transcend this reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>consolidation/extension of mind/body discussion</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/58</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As we discussed rather unsatisfactorily, one of the questions raised about Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer concerns the relationship between mind and the body. Can one live without the other? Is one monstrous and one glorified? On the one hand, Case is constantly escaping the bounds of &quot;the meat&quot; by entering cyberspace. He obviously prefers the space of the mind than the body that seems to hold him back, keeping him in the tangible world. At the same time, however, when in cyberspace he visualizes a body for the entity that represents his thought. Moreover, Case is unable to delve into cyberspace unless his body is in working order, especially the wiring of his nervous system. His body may be unimportant as a whole, but certain parts of it and the fact that he is alive let his mind escape in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a different perspective, there are very few &quot;cowboys&quot; like Case in the world, people who actually can hack (&quot;jack&quot;) into cyberspace. The majority of the populace is forever stuck in the meat. Whether because of this, in spite of this, or in simple unacknowledgement of the possibility of mental escape (at least through cyberspace; obviously drugs can provide some escape), people modify their bodies. Most often it is for reasons of beauty, almost agreeing with Case that the body is an ugly annoyance that needs to be perfected, or opposing him because the body is glorious and must be enhanced and celebrated. Interestingly, Molly makes modifications for more utilitarian reasons; indeed, Molly is something of an anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Renting the goods, is all. You aren&#039;t in [your body], when it&#039;s all happening.&quot; (147) The only time Molly&#039;s mind is outside her body is when she is a prostitute, a &quot;puppet&quot; (an apt name). What this means as far as the significance of the mind and the body is unclear. Her body provides pleasure for others, but pleasure can be derived by less physical means as well. She is disconnected from her body at this time, suggesting that the deeds her body does are too ugly for her mind, that her mind is above prostitution in some way though her body isn&#039;t. Of course, her mind agreed to sell her body in the first place, so this can&#039;t exactly be true. Finally, her mind didn&#039;t travel to cyberspace or any place equivalent; it seems her mind basically &quot;slept&quot; until the sex was over. Also, after leaving prostitution, she now makes a living selling her body in another way, as a bodyguard. Through Molly, we definitely see the body as more valuable than the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Molly and Case are somewhere in the middle, at the ends of the spectrum between mind and body are the AI and Armitage. The AI is purely mind, and while this presents many advantages, it also means the AI can&#039;t move things in the physical world, which is why he needs Molly and Case. Moreover, the AI is in no way human, just a thinking machine. At the other end lies Armitage, basically a body without a mind. The AI has given Armitage/Corto something of a mind to keep him stable for a time, but there&#039;s nothing really there behind the blank blue eyes, as Case often notes uncomfortably. In this way, Armitage appears inhuman, or at least less than human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings to mind (somewhat tangentially) a thought-provoking line in Neuromancer: &quot;Case had always taken it for granted that the real bosses, the kingpins in a given industry, would be both more and less than people.&quot; (203) There is something in the job title that requires the &quot;real bosses&quot; to be different somehow than the average human being. Certainly in Case&#039;s case (what kind of a name is &quot;Case&quot;, anyway?) the real boss is anything but a person. The AI controls the whole team. This suggests that humans are not capable of actually holding power, that machines are better suited to it--kind of a scary thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the relationship between mind and body: I think that whether the novel elevates the mind over the body or the other way around, it proves that both are necessary components to being human. There&#039;s a reason for the phrase &quot;mind, body, and soul&quot;--we really aren&#039;t human if we lack one of these, like the AI or Armitage (the soul is another matter worth exploring, but not, perhaps, alongside Neuromancer). No matter how much Case may crave the freedom of his mind, he needs &quot;the meat&quot; if he wants to stay human. The meat is a part of who he is.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Place of Language in the (Non-)Reality of Neuromancer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/56</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer is a novel that could be discussed at great length in pretty much any context because he has filled it with some extremely complicated characters in a very elaborate context.  One benefit of his choice to mainly depict the areas of Biz and criminal activities is that he has created such a rich image of this one aspect of Case&#039;s reality, and it alludes to an even bigger world image that is often suggested in casual comments throughout the book and also all of the scenes set in Freeside.  While he often leaves the reader dangling in terms of defining technology and any kind of easily visualized concept of geography, his descriptions are quite possibly the most fantastic constant.  When discussing such complex and previously unconsidered ideas as a portable reconstruction of a deceased human being&#039;s personality and skills that can virtually interact with reality on a certain level, Gibson could very easily confuse readers into putting the book down and never giving it another thought.&lt;br /&gt;
What keeps the reader&#039;s attention throughout the book&#039;s more challenging scenes is Gibson&#039;s ability to create such bizarre and vivid images.  He renders characters, both in their physical bodies and their personalities, with unconventional descriptors and sometimes paradoxical qualities.  Interestingly, he will use a highly descriptive passage and later, will revisit what he had been discussing with a casual throw away comment, often incorporating slang (either slang the reader is familiar with from reality, or his own fictional slang).  One example of this is when Gibson is describing Molly&#039;s pain as Case experienced it through the simstim connection.&lt;br /&gt;
	&quot;Case remembered the injection.  What had they given her?  The pain was still there, but it came through as a tight focus of scrambled impressions.  Neon worms writhing in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill--his mind recoiled from it.  If he avoided focusing on it, the impressions overlapped, became a sensory equivalent of white noise.&quot; (217-218)&lt;br /&gt;
Gibson&#039;s description of Molly&#039;s pain is still difficult to imagine and recreate in one&#039;s own sense memory, but his detail, the imagery he conjures to try to convey meaning to his audience is masterful.  On the other hand, earlier in roughly the same scene, Gibson has Wintermute speaking through the Finn and telling Case that &quot;Molly&#039;s leg&#039;s falling off for starts.  Can&#039;t walk.&quot; (216)  His balance of the colloquial dialogue of his characters and the extremely vivid and intricate descriptions he uses as narrator force the reader to remain entrenched in the personalities of the characters and the way they relate to the world, but also allow the reader to play with the idea of what these characters are experiencing.  When given an image like &quot;neon worms writhing in her thigh,&quot; the reader can only attempt to recreate that sensation, thereby relating more closely and realistically with the character.&lt;br /&gt;
	Gibson&#039;s use of these two methods of conveying information to the reader reinforces the overarching concept of reality and non-reality, the paradox of experience as virtual and/or &quot;real&quot;.  There is such a blurred line between what a character can be said to experience versus dreaming or imagining, and his language only enhances the reader&#039;s understanding of that.  The tangible and the intangible are at times inseparable in Case&#039;s experience and the contrast between the straight forward expressions of the characters and the convoluted, sensory descriptions in the narrative contribute to a confused sense of reality and experience in Gibson&#039;s futuristic space.&lt;/p&gt;
