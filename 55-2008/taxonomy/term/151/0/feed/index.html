 <title>Left Hand of Darkness and the Masculine Ideal</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/142</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Le Guin presents to us, in The Left Hand of Darkness, with a breed of human which is truly biologically asexual, and posits that many of the traits we consider implicit to mankind are a result of the way we categorize behaviors, activities, ideologies and so forth in a male/female, dualistic manner. To strengthen the distinction between &quot;us&quot; (represented by Genly Ai) and &quot;them&quot; (the Gethenians in general and Estraven in particular), she gives us a very distinctive, stereotyped view of masculinity and femininity through Genly Ai early in the novel. Estraven is said to have &quot;...a man&#039;s power...&quot; (p. 7) as part of his character; his ability to influence and command others is, for Genly Ai, an explicitly masculine trait. Moments later, Genly expresses his distaste for what he refers to as &quot;...feminine intrigue...&quot; (p.8). The strongest moment of defining the masculine/feminine divide occurs at the palace; Genly thinks&quot;...that at table Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit.&quot; (p. 12). Le Guin&#039;s assigning of these stock roles to men and woman--power and strength versus subtlety and charm--while serving a purpose in emphasizing the duality in our culture (and the lack of one in Gethenian culture), is also misleading, and can lead to a potential misunderstanding of the novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideals of masculinity and femininity are cultural, not integral to our biology. Even in so small a difference as (in my experience) Italian versus American culture, behaviors that are considered proper form for men in one place may be seen as totally effeminate in the other. This variation ranges much more once you leave the context of Western societies, so much so that in certain areas of the world (some groups in the Caribbean, for example) aggression and physical dominance is associated with women, while subtlety and child-rearing is largely the domain of men. While that fundamental issue of duality remains, the actual traits which define masculinity and femininity are essentially irrelevant. In presenting a stereotyped Western-American cultural bias for defining the male/female divide, I feel that Le Guin runs the risk of drawing the reader too far into that mindset; although Genly perceives &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; traits in Estraven, he is simply put incorrect; Estraven&#039;s character is a unified whole, lacking binary division or masculine or feminine traits. Only once Estraven is understood as a whole person, rather than a bizarre, discomfiting amalgation of apparently opposing traits does he, and his society as a whole, make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>An Interesting Ending to and Interesting Novel...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/127</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Le Guin&#039;s novel seems to be an interesting, if strange, subject -- bisexual individuals -- yet it seems that a majority of the sort of &quot;oddness&quot; that appears is either random differences from humans -- for example, not being able to say the &quot;L&quot; sound (Le Guin 30) -- or in the developing relationship between Genly and Estraven in the later parts of the novel.  Other than that....most of the events and societal customs observed seem either familiar or not very outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the whole gender-neutral aspect seems to be focused on very little...with only random thoughts of Genly to remind a reader that these people are, indeed, alien.  At least how I read the novel, these individuals could easily pass as normal people, and the only defining characteristic that marks the world as alien is the endless cold and snow that permeates nearly every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the way it is described for the beginning of the novel, Gethen is not a very interesting place compared to Earth....and could almost be the same.  As time goes by however, primarily beginning with Genry and Estraven&#039;s journey across the ice, things seem to change.  Suddenly the &quot;interesting&quot; qualities of Estraven are more apparent (what with the two of them alone out there) and for probably the first time it is easily apparent both to Genry and us as readers how alien and different such a characteristic (bisexualism) really is.  While for most of the novel the various people appear as solely male...Estraven slowly but surely shows his feminine side during the times in the tent on the Gobrin ice, especially when he comes to be in kemmer (232).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several chapters of stark contrast, the novel ends similarly to how it began....but the effect of that time the pair spent on the ice is still there, and even Genry notices how much the natives have changed him...seeing his own kind as strange (296).  As a result, even though the topic was avoided for a majority of the novel, the dual feminism and masculinity of the people of Gethen seems all the stranger...yet much more interesting for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;d I miss?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/116</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;[edit: Never mind. I ran into someone who caught me up. I&#039;m keeping the post up here for the Le Guin link below]&lt;br /&gt;
I was down in San Diego during class today. Could someone give me a super-brief run-down of what we talked about? (e.g. The impact of Black=normal on racial/political relations in Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin&#039;s treatment of gender as ____, Soviet Union/USA metaphors, or whatever we ended up discussing). Thanks much!&lt;/p&gt;
