 <title>Where the danger lies</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/217</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After class yesterday, I realized that a lot of discomfort with Cyteen&#039;s universe comes from the fact that individuals&#039; futures, to some degree, seem to be determined by forces outside their power.  This outside force appears in the form of tape, genetic manipulation, and environmental manipulation, as with Ari.  However, despite this level of control, and despite the disturbing subservience of the azi, the technology of tape and genetic manipulation doesn&#039;t really scare me on principle.  What scares me in this is the culturally developed belief that behavior is deterministic.  It is this belief that presents a society which appears so sinister.  The tape is useful, and yields a more competent, but the mentality of control causes simply sad situations, such as Jane leaving, to turn into scary ones.  For Nelly, instead of letting the grief of loss reshape her personality, as would happen in our society, they find it necessary to reprogram her to handle the loss, because to do otherwise would be to lose a valuable asset.  What is really being done to Nelly isn&#039;t really healing at all.  It is merely reestablishing the control which the society has over her.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cyteen response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/216</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, I did enjoy Cyteen for the story and the characters, particularly in the development of the second Ariane.  However, much of the politics and the verbal sparring went over my head, and I fear this was a significant portion of the novel.  All of the different alliances and enmities between the major political influences in the novel seemed to change so fast, and often to cues that I as a reader did not pick up for several pages after.  The only point that remained constant was Mikhail&#039;s dislike of both the young and old Ariane, and the need for everyone, everywhere, to watch what he or she says for fear of eavesdroppers.  I would have liked more discussion on the sides for and against the system that includes all of the genetic manipulation and the purpose of the &#039;azi.&#039;  I think the Abolitionists were the major party against this, but I may be wrong.  I guess with the severely limited starting population of a planet, some gene manipulation would have to occur to stop proliferation of genetic diseases and weaknesses, but I was surprised that this was not important to many of the characters of the novel.  It appeared that the people had largely just accepted the changes and experiments, as long as the result was human.  I have trouble believing the lack of controversy here.  I guess the secrecy of the grander experiments done by Ariane and the other top researchers may have helped hide this from the public, but I just don&#039;t think the population would accept this system.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, all this small starting population (meaning limited and often unified viewpoints) and the introduction of the &#039;tapes&#039; seems to have created a society in which this is the norm.  The tapes themselves are also controversial, both the tranquilizings needed to view the tapes and the level on which many of them affect the recipient.  While the ability to learn and remember something very quickly and painlessly would be great, I am surprised that there has been no sabotage.  The talk of a tape &#039;worm&#039; interspersed in the novel introduces the idea of some latent danger from the tapes, but with the way they can affect the most basic logic of human consciousness, I would think there would have been some kind of terrorist or conspiracy attempt by those in control.  On a similar note the azi, particularly Caitlin and Florian, have very little say in what they do, and constantly strive to make their master(s) happy. Perhaps this takeover has already occurred through selective breeding and tape inundation, but in such a way and on a scale as to make acceptable to the public as well.  I would think that some kind of artificial intelligence could do many of the jobs just as well as the azi, while not being requiring all of the birthing and raising process.  A society that has faster-than-light travel should be able to manage this.  There is so much of this absolute control over human life, with cloning, breeding, and rejuve, and it strikes me as odd that there has been so little effort to create trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Azi Musings</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/215</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this novel was absurdly huge, straight up finishing over break was more important than annotating at the time, unfortunately, but here it goes.&lt;br /&gt;
There were lots of interesting facets to this novel, which made getting through it a lot easier, but one of the most interesting parts was the Azi.  Cherryh never really explains the process of their creation.  We get small snippets over the course of the novel, and can piece together some sort of idea of how they&#039;re made.  We learn that they were initially created as filler for too-empty populations, to stimulate economic growth.  There were insufficient adults to give the children they needed individual attention, so Resune developed tape-learning, and raised the Azi synthetically instead.  They were a solution to a problem initially, a sort of ready-made human, but I didn&#039;t get the feeling that, at least originally, they were anything like slaves.&lt;br /&gt;
Tape learning teaches incredibly specific skills, like penmanship and horseback riding, so that method of teaching allowed for the creation of incredibly specific behaviors. Such incredible specificity led to the creation of azi to fill specific roles, rather than general bodies capable of stimulating the economy.  The &quot;batches&quot; of azi are defined by their genesets, and have tape designed specifically for each geneset.  These batches range from the Rho-class which has an &quot;Rezner [score of] 45 and below&quot; and an &quot;ability to rebound from mishandling and bad tape&quot; and is used for experimentation and general labor, to the alphas which score upward from 150 on the Rezner scale and are generated &quot;only rarely except for specific executive assignments&quot; (29-30).  Thus we have selective breeding, as never before seen by humans, performed on humans.  The creation of individuals for specific societal roles is not exactly slavery, but it certainly causes some problems with free will.  The reasearchers in charge of the tape program reward systems into the azi.  Justin&#039;s pet project is changing these systems so that the azi get pleasure directly from the work that the programmers choose that the azi should do.  This really seems to be absurdly specific selective breeding.  In the initial world-setting stage of the book an educational publication states, &quot;AGCULT-789X, experimental as the X-designation indicates, closely resembles the RYX-20s or the EU-4561s, except that the genetic codes of the RYX-20s and the EU-4561s indicate two feet while that of AGCULT-789X indicates for, and the RYX-20&#039;s and the EU-4651&#039;s codes indicate smooth skin, while AGCULT-789X&#039;s indicates a sleek bay hide and a superlative ability to run&quot; (31).  The RYX-20s and EU4561s are azi and the AGCULT-789X are horses, the only difference between the azi and the livestock are number of legs, hide type, and speed.&lt;br /&gt;
As disturbing as this all seems however, the azi certainly aren&#039;t unhappy with their programming, and they understand that they are programmed.  There are benefits to being an azi.  Since they&#039;re programmed for whatever function they perform, they are, generally speaking, impeccable in their performance.  All the security in the novel are azi because no one would prefer human body guard with slow reaction times when they could have Catlin instead.  And born-men have their own problems.  &quot;Excited born-men go to alternate programming sets. Every born-man is a schiz,&quot; Grant says, &quot;And he hates his alter ego&quot; (240).  Grant even says that he prefers his &quot;natural&quot; psychset (240).&lt;br /&gt;
The problem I think, is being an azi in a born-men world.  Azi are superior to born-men in many ways, but the born-men take them for granted.  At one point Grant gets incredibly frustrated with the born-men (including Justin) for not listening to an azi&#039;s point of view &quot;There&#039;s listening and listening,&quot; he says &quot;They&#039;ll always listen to me, when they won&#039;t, you.  But they won&#039;t listen to me the way they do you.  No more than they do Willâ€¦ they won&#039;t take his word&quot; and its because he&#039;s an azi (429).   That attitude of the born men is not only unfair, its stupid.  Grant points out at the beginning of the novel that azi and born-men have their strengths and weaknesses.  The azi take in every detail, weed out inconsistencies, which is why they can quickly process certain problems that the born-men can&#039;t even hold in their head.  He explains to Justin that as a born-man &quot;you&#039;re better at averaging shades than you are at remembering what really happened, that&#039;s how you can process things that come at you fast and from all sides.  And that&#039;s what we&#039;re worst at&quot; (154).&lt;br /&gt;
So, even though azi are treated like second-class citizens, or even livestock, they aren&#039;t inferior to the men who create them, they are better in certain respects.  And they&#039;re happy being azi, when born-men don&#039;t get in the way.  So it doesn&#039;t really seem necessarily bad to be an azi.&lt;/p&gt;
