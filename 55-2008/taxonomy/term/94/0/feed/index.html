 <title>Breaking Down Cyberpunk: Matrix and Disillusionment</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/69</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Neuromancer is widely known as the defining novel of the &quot;cyberpunk&quot; subgenre (of which I am particularly a fan) â€“ so, regardless of what has happened in science fiction since then, the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; was specifically applied to this novel as a defining mark. Therefore, disassembling that word should provide some insight into the defining features of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a composite of two terms - &quot;cyber&quot; and &quot;punk&quot;, the sources are obvious. The &quot;cyber&quot; doubtlessly refers to &quot;cyberspace&quot;, the term coined by Neuromancer for describing the world in which people enter when they plug into the &quot;consensual hallucination&quot; of the matrix. Much of the novel is set in this realm: if we count time spent on simstim, Case is in cyberspace probably more often than everywhere else combined. So that much is obvious â€“ the &quot;cyber&quot; means that the characters live in a universe where a digital communication network is as important â€“ if not more important â€“ than the physical world, otherwise known as &quot;meatspace&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other part, the &quot;punk&quot; half, is perhaps more interesting. The characters of Neuromancer, Case especially, aren&#039;t good guys. Case doesn&#039;t work for charity, he doesn&#039;t fight for what&#039;s right, and his only motivations appear to be self-preservation, the pursuit of the next high, and simple hatred. But that&#039;s simplifying things. For a moment, Case is something different, when he spouts at 3Jane: &quot;What&#039;ll ever fucking change for you? You&#039;ll wind up like the old man. You&#039;ll tear it all down and start building again! You&#039;ll build the walls back, tighter and tighter....I got no idea at all what&#039;ll happen if Wintermute wins, but it&#039;ll change something!&quot; (260). For this moment, it seems like Case is hoping for a better future, not just for himself, but for 3Jane and everyone else. But that&#039;s not what happens. In the end, &quot;Things aren&#039;t different. Things are things,&quot; and that&#039;s all that Post-Wintermute has to say about it. And after that final revelation, Case gives up and reverts to his previous self, blowing his reward cash on a new pancreas and liver that will allow him to receive normal effects from the amphetamines to which he is addicted.  Case undergoes a transformation from criminal, to idealistic hero, back to disillusioned criminal.  In this way, the cynical message of the book can be seen to represent the &quot;punk&quot; aspect â€“ and this is the attitude which defines not only Neuromancer, but the cyberpunk genre in general.&lt;/p&gt;
