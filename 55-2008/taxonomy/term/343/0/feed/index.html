 <title>recognizing a life pattern</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/341</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m going to use my last &quot;freebie&quot; blog post and cop out on this one, because I have two term papers due this week as well as a video production project, and all of my ideas about this novel were pretty thoroughly dissected in class. I will be making several comments on others&#039; posts to contribute, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace,&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>The End of the Past and Seeing Beyond</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/336</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At first, I was a bit confused about why The Matrix was our movie to watch with Pattern Recognition, but having thought about it I think there are two major themes that run through both works, though Pattern Recognition clearly tries to stay grounded roughly in the present, while The Matrix extrapolates them to  far more extreme situations. Both works, though, demonstrate the key challenges of defining history, through a character&#039;s ability to &quot;see beyond&quot; reality to some hidden truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that Pattern Recognition is in large part a response to 9/11, and Gibson clearly considers that event a major demarcation of history into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;. To this end, the many cultural references Gibson makes to technology and fashion serve to ground the world&#039;s chronology in a very exact and careful way; while some critics claimed that Gibson&#039;s style in this book would &quot;date&quot; it, this is in fact exactly what he must do to make his point. He is emphasizing that as of now, we cannot tie our culture back to the one of a few years prior, and thus our only way of defining the world is to use whatever cultural markers we have today. The rupture in cultural development has set us adrift, and we have only the most trivial methods of defining ourselves. This &quot;rupture&quot; is immediately obvious in the Matrix as well, where all of human experience hit an abrupt &quot;reset&quot; button, when the world simply became an endless computer simulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response to this rupture and lack of total comprehension is a character who understands reality, albeit intuitively rather than consciously, on a deeper level, to see the hidden machinery that most people accept blindly. Cayse and Neo are both heroes in these worlds because they can somehow tap into the forces of the world that would otherwise hinder them: Cayse the cultural flow of trends and fashions, Neo the computer code of the Matrix. While they cannot return to the pre-rupture world, they are nonetheless able to ground themselves in some deeper reality while most people are simply floating through a world newly separated from its own history.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/335</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Pattern Recognition Science Fiction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think so.  Of course Science Fiction is already a fairly ill defined genre.  However, I would define Science fiction as having a What if? Statement that is explored in the novel.  For example, The Left Hand of Darkness asked what if there was a planet of androgynies.  Neuromancer asked what if there were a world wide information network and AIs in habiting it.  Pattern Recognition doesn&#039;t make any such supposition to me.  It seems like a perfectly acceptable story that could really happen in real life, and for me that means that it is just fiction.  Everything in Pattern Recognition was based in reality in a way that Science Fiction doesn&#039;t seem to be.  The most far fetched thing was Cayce&#039;s allergy to trademarks and brands, but as a psychosomatic disorder,  it seems like it could happen.  The rampant use of email can be used as an example of science in the fiction, but it appears just like normal life.  Had this book been set 10-15 years ago, I could see email being as ubiquitous as it is in the novel as a argument for science fiction, but because people actually use email as often as it is used in the book it no longer seems out of the ordinary.  Meeting people from forums is also old hat.  The story of people meeting online, dating, and then falling in love and marrying is now a common place story.  Pattern Recognition is a good book, but I can&#039;t consider it science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Identity and Relationships in Pattern Recognition&#039;s Online Space</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/334</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought one of the most interesting bits of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; was the way people&#039;s online friendships worked out - what with Parkaboy/Cayce and Judy/Taki eventually hooking up in the real world based on affections that were developed almost exclusively through online chatting. Obviously, this stuff says a lot about how Gibson sees the world of 2002 and the relation of technology in it to human interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cayce&#039;s dealings in cyberspace mostly take the form of posts on a publicly-available bulletin board, though she also engages in email. But the way Cayce uses that bulletin board is fundamentally different from the way Case interacts with others online in Neuromancer. That&#039;s because of the nature of the medium. Cayce, like most denizens of the modern web, can&#039;t converse face-to-face with her bulletin-board friends: she doesn&#039;t video-chat, so she can&#039;t sense people&#039;s body language, and she doesn&#039;t even have much idea who most of the people are outside of their commentary on the footage. Even though people have begun to develop communities and human relationships in cyberspace, these relationships and communities consist mostly of exchanges of text. People&#039;s identities are easily obscured, but - in &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt; â€“ the relationships they form are nonetheless legitimate and meaningful, often more powerful than predominantly in-person relationships. The deep friendship between Cayce and Parkaboy is the most prevalent example, but perhaps the most intriguing such relationship is between Judy and Taki. Originally, Musashi (Darryl) and Parkaboy are just using Judy as an image to weasel information out of Taki, but when she and Taki start actually talking with each other, &quot;She&#039;s mesmerized by the extent (she says the heartbreaking purity) of Taki&#039;s passion for her&quot; and begins to think &quot;that the love Taki has to offer her is the love she&#039;s waited for all her life&quot; despite &quot;the fact that she knews Taki things she&#039;s a petite Japanese college girl, and that Darryl is translating for her both ways&quot; (232). Gibson uses the book to comment that people are increasingly text-oriented, and the inability to prejudge people in the textual realm based on their race or appearance allows new kinds of relationships to exist, such as the love between Taki and Judy that subsists â€“ at least, initially â€“ on the basis of emotion and writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, that relationship seems to ultimately work out despite the problems it faces initially, as one of the final emails applauds &quot;her enthusiasm for the city (and her boyfriend!)&quot; in Tokyo (364-365). In the world of &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt;, not only is it possible to fall in love with someone just by exchanging emails, and ultimately to meet the person in real life â€“ but those relationships seem better than the relationships characters otherwise end up in â€“ as evidenced by the way Cayce ends up with Parkaboy instead of Damien, who is still muddled in a difficult relationship with the daughter of the man funding his documentary project. The happy resolutions point towards a general optimism about humans&#039; ability to adapt to such a text-based culture - maybe even a belief that such a world is better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hubertus and Cayce.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/330</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the analysis that I performed on Pattern Recognition in my final essay, I concluded that Cayce was almost asexual in the novel, and that any graphic or direct depictions of sex had an adverse effect on the commitments that Cayce had made or wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over the novel, in revising my paper, I&#039;ve realized that Cayce is far from asexual. In fact, I feel like her sexuality is a really fundamental piece of her personality, but, like everything about her and the novel, it is understated to the point that it is difficult to notice. One of the major interactions that I failed to consider in my first analysis was the interaction between Cayce and Hubertus, when they go out to the bar and Hubertus proposes the Footage project (61-73). Throughout the interaction, Cayce feels Hubertus&#039; presence: his voice is &quot;strangely compelling&quot; (62), he is &quot;undeniably good-looking&quot; (67), she feels herself &quot;held by those eyes, against all conscious will&quot; (64), she even flirts a little bit at the end of the night, showing Hubertus how to put on his cowboy hat properly (73). Cayce is clearly attracted to Hubertus, somehow, but it is a definitely physical attraction. Though it may not be directly sexual, it is definitely not intellectual, and in fact goes counter to Cayce&#039;s natural impulses. Sex is one of the first things on her mind when she interacts with Bigend (she&#039;s suddenly on &quot;full sexual alert&quot; (63)), so she is clearly not asexual. She understands and realizes her own reactions to Bigend, but she keeps them hidden and does not outwardly react to them. But nevertheless, this desire, this outward sexuality is associated with Bigend, who Cayce never completely trusts (also partly because of the sexual betrayal that he has inflicted on her friend from New York). Throughout the novel, it is the handsome men, the ones that she feels some sort of desire for, that Cayce distrusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my reconsideration of the overall tone of the novel, and of Cayce&#039;s attitude towards sex, I still think that the direct appearance of sex is closely associated with the breaking of commitments and a lack of trust. There is one major counter-example to this argument, that was pointed out by both professor Fitzpatrick and my peer reviewer. In my rough draft, I mentioned the example of Donny, who is mentioned at length only twice in the novel, both times regarding sexual experiences that Cayce had with him. I regarded both of these experiences as essentially the same: direct portrayals of sex, and a direct associations between sex and Donny, who Cayce rightly broke up with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reviewers pointed out that the real reason that Cayce broke up with Donny was not because of the overt association between him and sex (Cayce is &quot;more or less happy&quot; lying underneath him, after all), but instead because of the association of Donny with extremely violent behavior (finding the gun taped conveniently behind his headboard) (41). I agree with this argument, to some extent. However, I think that the association between this breakup and sex is inescapable. It could have been any other time that Cayce could have realized that Donny was a violent person. He could have hit her, he could have gotten unreasonably angry, she could even have found the gun while she was stretching to wake up in the morning next to him. But she found it during sex. Her breakup with this person, no matter the actual reason, occurred during the one and only semi-graphic portrayal of sex in the entire novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m sure that there were good moments with Donny, just as there are redeeming factors to Boone Chu and Hubertus, but in the way that Cayce&#039;s attraction to all these men is associated with lack of trust and the breaking of commitments, the novel discounts these good qualities and returns to my main point: sex must be secondary in Cayce&#039;s interactions with others, or there can be no trust between them.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>recognizing names</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/326</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I found interesting about Pattern Recognition--especially as it includes a world of screen names--is the use of names. Obviously we touched on Cayce in class, but only briefly. What struck me most about Cayce was that, just before she explains the pronunciation of her name, she actually tells Voytek, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; (Gibson 32). Never having actually read Moby Dick (my high school was rather terrible), I would have just been confused by this statement except that in another of my classes, we just recently read a different novel with a very similar reference. For those of you in the dark, like I was, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; is the first line in Moby Dick. What we immediately know about Ishmael--and Cayce?--is that he is a survivor of the story he is about to recount. I suppose this is encouraging as far as Cayce is concerned because her story is told in present tense, as if it is all happening *right now*. The idea that she will survive the events of the novel, whatever they may become, is nice to note. The other interesting thing about this line is that, from the way it is phrased, the reader can never know whether or not Ishmael is the narrator&#039;s real name. This certainly ties into the idea that &quot;Cayce,&quot; according to her, should actually be pronounced &quot;Casey,&quot; but she says it as &quot;Case.&quot; This, coupled with the fact that the only other Gibson I&#039;ve read featured another Case as narrator (interesting pun), adds to the ambiguity of her actual name. To go even further, it can be said that no one has any one true name, as the nature of names is that they are ambiguous: is our narrator Cayce, Cayce Pollard, or CayceP? And those are only the names we are given in the novel--we aren&#039;t told her middle name (unless I missed that somewhere), and she might have other nicknames as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Cayce is not the only name of interest in Pattern Recognition; certainly the title suggests the reader will be looking for connections and importance in all names (as well as other things). We are very briefly introduced to Parkaboy on page four, the name not really fitting with his description later on as &quot;a man with reddish, receding hair, combed straight back,&quot; who purposefully describes himself as a &quot;middle-aged white guy&quot; (337). His &quot;real&quot; name is Peter Gilbert, which does seem to fit this description better. Interestingly, however, &quot;Parkaboy&quot; appears very fitting to his online personality, the way he writes in emails and forums--kind of silly but with a solid intelligence behind it. It makes me want to think of the physical person as Peter Gilbert and of the personality as Parkaboy; yet of course, they are one and the same. It does show, however, that if we were left to pick our own names, we might pick names that more accurately fit who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is Hubertus Bigend, who seems to fit his name in some perfect way: &quot;a nominal Belgian who looks like Tom Cruise on a diet of virgins&#039; blood and truffled chocolates&quot; (7). His girth apparently fits his name, though he either does not see the humorous connection or (more likely, given pattern recognition) he refuses to acknowledge it. Cayce also knows Bigend as a &quot;Lombard,&quot; &quot;which Cayce had at first thought might be a reference somehow to his Belgian-ness, until learning, upon finally asking, that it was Margot&#039;s acronym for &#039;Loads of money but a real dickhead&#039; &quot; (57). In this case, of course, the name is quite applicable, and once again goes to show that names made up later in life better portray the person than names given at birth (though Bigend&#039;s name comes close to this). This does point out the problem with trying to give associations to people&#039;s names in novels--for a character&#039;s name to mean something about him or her, it actually must be a name that would not be theirs in reality. What I mean is, in the real world, names don&#039;t usually say something about a person&#039;s character, the way they often do in a novel. Thus, the more &quot;realistic&quot; a novel is, the less the names will mean. How disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>pattern recognition response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/325</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it&#039;s been a while since I last posted a response, so here are some thoughts about Pattern Recognition. Two aspects of this which I thought were quite interesting were the ideas of mirror worlds and soul-delay.  What struck me as particularly interesting about mirror worlds was that, in a way, I read the book as thought it was set in a mirror world to our own.  It is a world we more or less know, but the manner in which Gibson presents it is quite foreign. There are Starbucks on street corners, familiar cities and recognizable brand names are everywhere. It&#039;s a version of our world, only tweaked slightly. There are other corporations as well and the use of technology, while it seems quite commonplace in 2008, was something not unheard of, but pretty new back in 2002. I found that the notion of &quot;cognitive estrangement&quot; worked well in this regard since its just similar enough to home that the differences can be off-putting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of soul delay I also thought was intriguing. Cayce explains that &quot;Damien&#039;s theory of jet lag is correct: that her mortal soul is leagues behind her, being reeled in on some ghostly umbilical down the vanished wake of the plane that brought her here, hundreds of thousands of feet above the Atlantic. Souls can&#039;t move that quickly, and are left behind, and must be awaited, upon arrival, like lost luggage&quot; (1-2).  She seems to be very concerned with soul-delay. I thought it was interesting so I made little ticks when it was mentioned and ended up making about two dozen ticks. In fact, she seems to be concerned with souls in general. When discussing how people of the future will look on people of her time she says that they won&#039;t think about  &quot;ordinary actual living souls&quot; (58) And that her father&#039;s colleagues were not &quot;felled by anything more sinister than stress and overwork, and perhaps by a species of depression engendered by too long and too closely observing the human soul&quot; (227) Interestingly, despite constantly discussing souls and soul-delay she claims that she doesn&#039;t know if she really believes in human souls. Perhaps it&#039;s the same way she doesn&#039;t actually believe in the EVP messages her mother is constantly sending her but which do &quot;creep (her) out&quot; (275) There seems to be a definitiveness about death, especially of the death of her father, which she doesn&#039;t want to accept and souls (and EVP) are a way to extend the life of someone, so to speak, although they aren&#039;t always believed to actually exist in a technologically and scientifically based world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So as much as I enjoyed the book I can&#039;t think of anything to add to what I said about it last Monday in class.  As much as I would love to scrutinize the mantra &quot;He took a duck in the face at two hundred and fifty knots&quot; I&#039;m finding myself particularly dry on creativity (101).  I think it&#039;s all been poured into my thesis.  I promise I&#039;ll have something fascinating to say about Oryx and Crake :-D&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Doer</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/322</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just thinking about the discussion of how Cayce does or doesn&#039;t fit the role of the female in science-fiction in respect to how things happen to her vs her happening to things.  I want to point out the fact that she transcends these categorizations in her professional life.  On one level, she very much makes the world revolve around her, as just a simple yes or no qualifies the value of a Logo into which a lot of time and money has been put.  However, it isn&#039;t quite her that does those things.  She frequently seems more like a vessel for her perceptive logo abilities than a wielder of them. For that reason, it&#039;s hard to categorize her into either stereotypical role of active agent or reactive agent.  Indeed, I think this also plays into the fact that a lot of of people have trouble gendering her while reading the book.  Maybe the fact that she doesn&#039;t fit into the stereotypical character roles also makes it harder for her to fit into the stereotypical gender roles.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pattern Recognition: An Outsider&#039;s Viewpoint</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/320</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world of billboards and ad spots, and more to the point, a world of product placement, growing ever more subtle, as demonstrated by Trans in Pattern Recognition, it seems that there&#039;s no way to understand Western culture without being so thoroughly exposed to advertising that corporate mores don&#039;t draw one in to a world where one is an object of the market.  Who then, has the ability to objectively observe markets in action without abstracting them to the degree of economics?  My answer, obviously, is that Cayce, with her absurd sensitivity to trademarks, logos, and anything chic, is the ultimate outsider amidst the commercial world she physically inhabits.  She has the equivalent of a sixth sense, which allows, yea, motivates her to note and avoid that which is intended to implicitly draw her into consumerism.&lt;br /&gt;
	Yet, even with an effectively superhuman ability to avoid marketing, Cayce has to go through an amazing amount of work to maintain her position on the outside.  Her clothes, no doubt difficult to acquire, giving her specifications, must be trimmed and filed carefully (and sometimes confusedly), until they gain the status of CPUs.  Her home, as we hear of it secondhand, is nearly ascetic.  It&#039;s difficult to obtain creature comforts without the logos that mark them as luxurious.  And her outsider status marks her as an outsider.  Her anti-fashion statement may appear indie, but doesn&#039;t blend into any particular culture, and would probably impede any effort she made to gain status in any particular sphere.  It seems that her separation from any one structure, any culture, makes power irrelevant to her world.  She certainly responds negatively, or at best, ambivalently, to any situations where any power differential is imposed on her.&lt;br /&gt;
	Perhaps as an outcome of her separation from the world around her, Cayce can see patterns in the mobs around her.  Her ability to spot emerging trends goes beyond her benevolent pathology to a type of pattern recognition that, while related to her allergy, is consciously cultivated, and at which she also clearly excels.  My question is, then, what would it take for any member of Pattern Recognition&#039;s audience to stand far enough above the fray to note the patterns as Cayce does?  Or is that only a divine perspective now?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Forum in Pattern Recognition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/318</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon reading William Gibson&#039;s novel &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, I noticed that the main character Cayce&#039;s life is sort-of divided into two different &quot;realms&quot;.  The first is reality, or better put her life outside in the city meeting people, working, discussing trends, etc.  The second, and the one that caught my interest, is her life and interaction on the forum, Fetish:Footage:Forum, which almost ends up being another world for Cayce and the other major posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum itself simply deals in what is called &quot;footage&quot;, essentially what seems to be porn videos of various forms and makes, but from the way that Cayce and other regular posters interact on the forum its more than just a fetish gallery.  Praise, arguments, friends, foes....the forum is a gathering place for more than just fetishists (so it seems...its not like Cayce is continually obsessed with that stuff in the novel).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about the forum though, I tend to compare it to the forums that I have seen, read, and participated in...of which there are many.  Some have been for clubs and educational purposes, while others were for games and still others for random chat.  There are definitely similarities to the F:F:F (not in topic mind).  When something big comes up, the posts really do go &quot;flying&quot; (47).  I have yet to see a forum without some sort of Off Topic section as well.  And of course, the ever-popular flame wars...much like the ones between Parkaboy and Mama Anarchia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with forums might seem just like having conversations with people in real life, and it is true that the only physical differences are time delay and typing instead of speaking.  However, one thing I notice a lot of the time is that forums tend to bring out the extremes in people.  For some reason (and not totally unexpected), people tend to speak their minds more...oppose and argue with others to a greater degree...create topics that just keep going and going and going and never stop unless someone stops posting...(generally the flame wars, and most of the ones I&#039;ve seen never really get resolved....they just die).  So, perhaps the forum is not an ideal direct parallel to real life conversation...but it does tend to bring out the best and worst in people that one wouldn&#039;t see normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned, its to not get too involved in random forum...because it is sooo easy to spend half a lifetime in them (kinda like Cayce is here).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Neuromancer vs. Pattern Recognition: Evolution towards Ambiguity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/315</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick internet search revealed to me that Pattern Recognition, the eighth novel by William Gibson, was the first to be on the New York Times Bestsellers list, and the first to be set in a contemporary world instead of a fantastical one. The increased overall popularity of the more recent William Gibson novels ( as opposed to Neuromancer, whose popularity was more of a word-of-mouth cult hit ) may be due to this; however, speaking personally, I found the contemporary world of Pattern Recognition less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious thing about Gibson&#039;s work is that it is so incredibly dense and detailed, convoluted with tech-slang and computer jargon everywhere. &quot; Cognitive estrangement &quot;, as mentioned in the first week; making a fictional world so strange that it forces us to re-examine the way we think about reality. Neuromancer&#039;s early-cyberspace world does this with its advanced technologies and virtual worlds. Pattern Recognition tries to do the same. Unfortunately, Pattern Recognition takes it too far, by creating a world ( ironically, even more &quot; grounded &quot; in our reality ) that&#039;s so alien that the message is lost in its own convolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, may well be the point. Gibson may be trying to show us that the future ( which we are living in now ) is even more alien and disconnected than we ever could have imagined. But the narrative didn&#039;t communicate this to me as well. Neuromancer may have been talking about a profoundly artificial world, but it did so through a more traditional narrative-- a designated ( if not actually ) heroic protagonist on an action-packed adventure, who ends up changing the world at large. The characters may have been thinner and more cliche, but they were identifiable-- familiar &quot; cliches &quot; to ground very unfamiliar ideas. The cast of Pattern Recognition are more complex, but also much harder to define, and thus I think the power of the statements in the book are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit: Case is an anti-heroic super-hacker, a &quot; console cowboy &quot; who could be a typical video game hero. Cayce is a design-sensitive marketing consultant who explores metropolitan board meetings, club scenes, and hotel arrangements in an attempt to find context and understanding in her multimedia world. More complex, but almost paralyzingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>language in Pattern Recongition</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/313</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;ve been reading Pattern Recognition, and I&#039;ve noticed that Gibson writes with what I perceive to be a British tone, with British vernacular - &quot;bin it&quot; rather than &quot;throw it away,&quot; &quot;come round&quot; instead of &quot;stop by&quot; or &quot;go over,&quot; casual use of the often-still-forbidden-in-America &quot;C-word&quot;, stuff like that.  However, he is apparently from Vancouver.  Is he affecting a British tone because it&#039;s set in London, or do Canadians speak/write more British than American?  It seems a really silly/trivial question, but it&#039;s been bothering me and I&#039;m supercurious now.&lt;/p&gt;
