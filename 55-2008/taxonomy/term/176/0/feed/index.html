 <title>Interpreting an Origin Myth</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/146</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d like to talk about the Orgota Creation Myth (p.237), because I think the origin myth that a genetically engineered people come up with is an interesting notion (and one that you could only pull off in sci-fi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I find it interesting that there is neither a single omnipotent God figure, nor the dual Adam and Eve figures, but rather 3 &quot;creator&quot; figures. Perhaps the idea here is to emphasize that what we see as &quot;no gender&quot; is in fact its own gender, so while we see the people of Winter as oscillating between androgyny and the male/female binary, the people see themselves (through their myth) as having 3 distinct states of being. It&#039;s worth noting that the 3 creators have 3 responses that could be ascribed to our own conceptions of the genders of Winter. &quot;I bleed&quot; and &quot;I weep&quot; could be seen as representing violence and emotion, which are generally split along the male/female binary (though if you really started analyzing bodily fluids as metaphors, you might see the two switching roles), while &quot;I sweat&quot; implies a purely physical response to the world, devoid of gender or sexuality. I think its impressive that LeGuin is capable of using language at its least flowery, as most myths demand, to still get across the complex sexuality (or gender, whatever the proper term is) of Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is also not without its interesting quirks. It is the first man, not the creators, who force snow and winter upon the world. The first man also kills 37 of the 39 people the creators made, which seems unusual for a world that cannot conceive of war (although personal violence is not quite as challenging a concept). Then the story ends by breaking a few major taboos--a house of corpses, and brotherly love in the most literal sense (and interesting companion piece to Chapter 2 on p. 22). Also, as we are all focused on the binaries and duality of the story, the myth ends with a declaration that the people of Winter find themselves in &quot;the middle of time&quot; (239), with shadows (I think blacklace went into some detail on this particular topic) reminding them of the eventual destruction of light and the permanence of winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, there seems to be a substantial commentary on the perception of sexuality of the people. On one hand, the three states of being are all seen as equally important towards creating the world; on the other hand, kemmering is referred to as &quot;burning&quot; (by corpses, no less), and the general species is born out of incest, which would imply that sex is not seen as a pure act by any means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other aspects of the story (inherent violence, avoiding the binary with respect to time) also merit discussion, I&#039;m sure, but I find the somewhat contradictory roles of sexuality and gender seem particularly interesting (even more so since they appear in an origin myth meant to summarize the entire culture).&lt;/p&gt;
