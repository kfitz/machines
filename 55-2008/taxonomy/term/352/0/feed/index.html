 <title>Pattern Recognition: brands</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/323</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In a lot of different ways, Pattern Recognition reminds me of some postmodern books I&#039;ve read, especially Infinite Jest.  IJ also exhibits signs of our society&#039;s preoccupation with brands (Large corporations advertise by sponsoring/subsidizing a year.  For example, &quot;Year of Dairy Products from the American Heartland.&quot;)  Also, during the discussion of Slow River, conspicuous consumption.  These are themes that also pop up in PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is set in the futuristic present, which is definitely preoccupied with labels, brands, and name-dropping.  Gibson casually references DKNY, Michelin, Louis Vuitton, and others.  The brands he mentions are brands from all over the world, and this emphasizes the ongoing globalization of a mass market.  The signs of this are everywhere.  Damien&#039;s flat has German and Italian appliances; Cayce has German locks installed; the coffee is from Colombia.  This is different from the concept of England as a &quot;mirror-world.&#039;&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;mirror-world,&quot; everything is slightly familiar and recognizable, yet different.  It is a foreign atmosphere with new species of brands to be wary of.  (Additionally, Cayce is thrown out of her element because she is unaccustomed to the British lifestyle: people drive on the opposite side of the road, the food looks and tastes different, etc.)  England&#039;s difference is attributed to the fact that its products are made and assembled within its borders.  &quot;They invented that here, probably, and made it here.  This was an industrial nation.  Buy a pair of scissors, you got British scissors.  They made all their own stuff.  Kept imports expensive...All their bits and pieces were different, from the ground up&quot; (108).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With outsourcing and such, products that are recognizably American are actually made in a different country.  As Boone Chu mentions, &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be that way much longer.  Not if the world&#039;s Bigends keep at it: no borders, pretty soon there&#039;s no mirror to be on the other side of&quot; (108). Cayce&#039;s beloved Buzz Rickson&#039;s, for example, are the Japanese reproduction of classic American WWII leather jackets.  &quot;It is an imitation more real somehow than that which it emulates&quot; (11).   What does this imply about the future of culture?  How will we be able to distinguish what is &quot;us&quot; and what is the &quot;other&quot; if the &quot;other&quot; is more &quot;us&quot; than we are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;
Since I&#039;m currently working on a paper for lit theory, Pattern Recognition also made me think of Cleanth Brooks and Roland Barthes, especially after the conversation in class about the author&#039;s intent.&lt;br /&gt;
The global fascination with the film clips is reminiscent of &quot;The Entertainment&quot; in Infinite Jest.&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s incredibly ironic that Cayce has this strange allergic reaction to brands, yet Bigend wants her to help him ultimately monetize the Footage, essentially making it into a brand.&lt;/p&gt;
