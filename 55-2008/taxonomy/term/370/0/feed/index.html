 <title>Pigoon Platoon... a last minute response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/356</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this response has nothing to do with pigoon platoons (although that bit where they trapped Snowman in the guardhouse was a bit unnerving) it just seemed catchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I actually want to discuss is sort of a response to a comment made in class (I think). I seem to recall someone mentioning something about Snowman being able to handle the whole apocalypse situation oddly well and the more I thought about it the more I started to think he wasn&#039;t really handling it that well at all. From the beginning we know that he is hearing voices which aren&#039;t even Oryx, for &quot;Oryx is no longer very talkative&quot; (11). He hates these voices and is staring to behave like the &quot;crazed lice-infested hermits in their caves and deserts&quot; who used to also hear such voices (11). When it comes to alcohol &quot;his impulse (is) to drink it up as fast as possible, turn all memory to white noise,&quot; not exactly the frame of mind of someone who is handling a situation well so much as making do in a pretty horrific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does at times seem to be taking good care of the Crakers, or at least not abandoning them. My thoughts about that are because he sees so much of Oryx in them. They have that innocence that she had and because of her connection to them I think it would be very hard for him to just leave them to their own devices. They also give him something to do. As was pointed out, he basically made his living just making things up and now is doing exactly the same thing and also learning from it. They also keep him company as best any living thing can at this point and he is afraid to &quot;lose his audience&quot; and that &quot;they&#039;d turn their backs on him, they&#039;d wander away&quot; (104). He needs some contact and has to make do with them even though they cannot understand so much and their questions can be frustrating at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also isn&#039;t doing well physically. The food he eats seems to come primarily from cans of left over from before and filled with such tasty things as &quot;SoyOBoy wieners&quot; and &quot;Sveltana No-Meat Cocktail Sausages.&quot; He doesn&#039;t hunt anything or even fish, and only gets this fish from the Crakers who bring it to him once a week. He looks for mirrors whenever he cans and what is sees is &quot;Increasingly â€¦ a shock. A stranger stares back at him, bleary-eyed, hollow-cheeked, pocked with bug-bite scabs. He looks twenty years older than he is&quot; (231).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that he is more a man who is making do as best he can, although there are probably people who could have done much better than he is. For instance, the humans he almost meets at the very end are at least cooking for themselves. Just some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ChickieNobs, PETA, and Crake.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/350</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Crake is an extremely interesting character in the novel, even more so after the discussion we had in class about him being a mad scientist/super genius.  Personally, I think he is a mad scientist, because he took the route that, in his view, promotes &#039;the greater good&#039;, with the end justifying the means.  But past this, I think what he did is something that anyone is capable of doing, given the circumstances.  He is extremely intelligent, and gets the best education; he has the drive to see his projects through, and develops the ego necessary to completely believe in his vision.  What I want to know though, it how he developed both the lack of empathy he shows towards not only the animals he experiments on, but also the countless people he kills as well.  It is this lack of care that places him beyond the usual clichÃ© of the scientist mistreating the animals he or she is experimenting on; he obviously cares for the planet.  His whole mission is to stop the pollution, influence, etc., that he thinks humans continue to cause just by existing.&lt;br /&gt;
	I remember it being brought up in class that PETA is offering a reward for anyone who can create a Petri-grown chicken substitute; perhaps this is the view that Crake takes, especially in regard to the ChickieNobs.  If I remember, he says it is easier to just imagine them as sea anemones.  Since they are not &#039;real&#039; animals, they do not deserve the same protections as animals.  On a side note, I wonder about how PETA will react to large-scale, perfect-genotype cloning, if we even get that far.  Will they offer the same protections to these animals (since they are animals in every since except their conception) as they do to &#039;normal&#039; animals?  If anyone knows, I would like to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;
	But back to ChickieNobs, with the disgust and revulsion I feel for the ChickieNobs organisms, I wonder if I could justify killing them.  This is too similar to the stance Crake takes; could I kill these things for the greater good, for their own good, without any way of getting their own opinions?  I still think Crake is at fault for being a part of their creation, but I think we have to be careful in condemning him and undoing his work, as we may end up being just as arrogant as he in thinking we are justified in killing them.  They are alive, if not completely sentient, and we harvest their products at constant detriment to themselves, (though the same things can be said about honeybees.  It is a tricky subject to approach, and one just can&#039;t say, &quot;Better they were never created at all,&quot; since it is all to easy to say that, by the amount of destruction and mayhem humanity has caused throughout its existence, we deserve the same fate.  Perhaps this is where Crake go this idea in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Math vs Language</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/344</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key theme in Margaret Atwood&#039;s Oryx and Crake  is the conflict between that which is empirically provable, and that which is a construct of the human mind.  This manifests in  a variety of ways: numbers vs. words, emotion vs. survival, art vs. science.  The protagonist, Jimmy/Snowman, is wrapped up in this conflict, because he is an advocate of the side which believes in the intangibles of human nature, but he feels like his side is losing, or has lost, depending on whether we address him before or after the catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;
	The conflict first emerges early in Jimmy&#039;s life in the guise of an innocent qualification.  He notices at a young age that Ramona talks as if she isn&#039;t very intelligent, but Jimmy&#039;s dad explains it away by saying that, &quot;she didn&#039;t want to put her neuron power into long sentences.&quot; (25)  Apparently, most people working at OrganInc behaved similarly, and it was because &quot;they were numbers people, not word people, [but] Jimmy already knew that he himself was not a numbers person.&quot; (25)  This statement seems innocuous at first: just a child realizing his strengths in language and weaknesses in mathematics.  Yet, as the story progresses, the emphasis on mathematical and logical competence in the compound increases.  As mentioned before, most of the employees of the compounds were oriented towards mathematical rather than verbal prowess, and as such, their children end up with the same orientation.  It&#039;s frequently mentioned that the schools he attends are saturated with genetic science or math geniuses.  The atmosphere is one where Jimmy&#039;s talents aren&#039;t valued, and he knows it.  He knows that his father, mother, and peers accept him as merely sub-standard.  This situation, combined with his desire to justify his own interests and be appreciated for them, is the main root for his perception that the practices of rational thought and artistic thought are at odds.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, once Crake enters Jimmy&#039;s life, the perceived dichotomy deepens to include more than just the two sides of academia.  Crake is the epitome of these math geniuses that make Jimmy&#039;s abilities fade into the background. Crake is characterized by his capacity for rational thought.  He is a remarkable student, who takes his capacity for logical reasoning beyond academia.  He applies it to social philosophy and uses it to dissect the meaning of human actions and their fundamental flaws.  Yet, this application of &quot;rational&quot; thought causes Jimmy to see another side of his own skills.  When hypothesizing about the new human race he would create, Crake addresses the issue of reproduction by effectively limiting romance to brief hormonal periods of fertility, claiming that the sexual frustration of humanity has caused more suffering than necessary.  Jimmy immediately picks up on this as an elimination of something very precious and unscientific: art.  Jimmy says &quot;[romantic frustration] has been an inspiration, or that&#039;s what they say.  Think of all the poetry--&quot; in an attempt to express the value of the &quot;free choice&quot; of romance. (166-7)  Yet, Crake, in his rational mindset, is unable to see art the way Jimmy does.  He responds to Jimmy&#039;s protests by saying, &quot;people can amuse themselves any way they like.  If they want to play with themselves in public, whack off over doodling, scribbling, and fiddling, it&#039;s fine with me.  Anyway it serves a biological purpose.&quot; (167)  He clearly cannot view art in terms of anything but scientifically verifiable value, and for that reason is very dismissive of art.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a trend throughout the entire story.  Jimmy&#039;s value are repeatedly marginalized.  Yet, the outcome cannot be ignored.  The outcome of supposedly perfectly rational thought is apparently apocalypse, and the replacement of humans with some hormonally driven human imitation.  Yet, in this new world, Jimmy is the only suvivor, and he does so through his connection to his extinct culture.  He repeats obscure words as mantras.  But more importantly, the result to Crake&#039;s scientific endeavor is a wholly unscientific people, who despite their programming, are developing mysticism around the legend of Crake and Oryx.  There seems to be a flaw in Crakes rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;
