 <title>Y - The Last Man</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&#039;s a comic book series called &quot;Y - The Last Man&quot; that&#039;s actually pretty related to the topics we&#039;ve been discussing lately. But unlike Left Hand of Darkness, which shows us a world where the two sexes as we know them have been sort of combined, this series shows us a world where one sex just ceases to exist. &lt;!--break--&gt;The story is about an English major named Yorick, and his pet monkey Ampersand, who are (apparently) the last remaining male mammals on planet earth after a catastrophe instantaneously wipes out all the others. Here&#039;s the description from the back of the first chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 4em&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Unmanned World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/2469/ythelastman00132ii4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid #888888&quot;/&gt;In the summer of 2002, a plague of unknown origin destroyed every last sperm, fetus, and fully developed mammal with a Y chromosome (with the apparent exception of one young man and his male pet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;gendercide&quot; instantaneously exterminated 48% of the global population, or approximately 29 billion men. 495 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are now dead, as are 99% of the world&#039;s landowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States alone, more than 95% of all commercial pilots, truck drivers, and ship captains died... as did 92% of violent felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally, 99% of all mechanics, electricians, and construction workers are now deceased... though 51% of the world&#039;s &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; labor force is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 nations, including Spain and Germany, have women soldiers who have served in ground combat units. &lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt; of the United States&#039; nearly 200,000 female troops have ever participated in ground combat. Australia, Norway, and Sweden are the only countries with women serving on board submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, all women between the ages of 18 and 26 have performed compulsory military service in the IDF for at least one year and nine months. Before the Plague, at least three Palestinian suicide bombers had been women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, 85% of all government representatives are now dead... as are 100% of Catholic priests, Muslim imams, and Orthodox Jewish rabbis.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&#039;m not sure if the &quot;29 billion men&quot; statistic is meant to be 2.9 or if it&#039;s referring to the male mammals also exterminated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series presents a pretty interesting view of what would happen. There&#039;s a fair amount of comic-book-ized material, like the badass secret agent who helps protect Yorick, and lots of somewhat cheesey, somewhat witty dialogue... but it&#039;s good. Some interesting phenomena that pop up: the &quot;Amazons&quot;, a cult whose philosophy is that men were punished and that the world is better off; Congress faces issues putting itself back together, because the remaining members are overwhelmingly Democrats, which the remaining ones see as unfair. Oh yeah, and there&#039;s less sex than you&#039;d think, because as it turns out, Yorick is trying to find his fiancÃ©, who was studying abroad in Australia when the Plague hit - unfortunately, it&#039;s not easy for anyone to find a boat or an airplane after the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Women in Starship Troopers - A More Well-Supported Argument</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/27</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is a little more formal than what others have been posting, but here it is anyway. It&#039;s somewhat an expansion of the comment I made earlier, with some more points and some textual support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a surface reading, it appears that women are a respected group in Starship Troopers. Rico repeatedly speaks of the intelligence of his friend Carmencita (27, among others), and he admires the prowess of the pilots that fly him into battle (9). However, when it comes down to it, there is little place for strength and honor among women in his world. In fact, Rico&#039;s attitude towards women is indicative of the systematic lack of respect that his society accords women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rico has two key close interactions with women of his own age in the book, both with Carmencita Ibanez. In the first, he is surprised when Carmencita tells him she wants to sign up for Federal service, since &quot;little Carmen was so ornamental that you just never thought about her being useful&quot; (26). It is hard to overstate how well this describes Rico&#039;s attitude toward women, whether they be his peers or his superiors. Though they may have key roles, Rico never considers them to have any kind of fundamentally important role in the workings of the universe. In fact, when Carmen gains some responsibility, Rico begins to respect her, but only insofar as she gains what he considers to be masculine qualities â€“ he finally sees her as an &quot;officer and a fighting man â€“ as well as a very pretty girl&quot; (139). In Rico&#039;s eyes, a warrior must be male, and if Carmen has these qualities, they must be separate from her femininity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the pilots in Starship Troopers seem to be a counter-example to this prejudice. Though every single soldier in the M.I. is male, the navy pilots are invariably female, and play a vital role in getting the soldiers to the ground safely. They are well-loved by the men whose lives are in their hands, and they hold absolute authority over their ship. But really, how respected are they? They are at most mid-ranking officers, who control their ship and perform a specific duty. In their capacity as troop transport drivers, they simply take the soldiers from one place to another, and never participate actively in the battle. As captains of navy warships, as mentioned in the book, they stand off at a distance and pound bug planets into oblivion. They are never present in the grit of the battlefield, and thus have no way to gain honor and respect in the eyes of the army men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one non-pilot female mentioned in the book, aside from Rico&#039;s mother, is actually smarter and more on top of things than her superior, and yet explicitly cut out of the chain of command. This is Miss Kendrick, the secretary to Rico&#039;s instructor Colonel Nielssen at the Officer academy. Colonel Nielssen admits that he signs &quot;anything, if Miss Kendrick has initialed it,&quot; and yet if he were to die, she would &quot;not do a blessed thingâ€¦because she is not in the line of command and has no authority&quot; (150). By all rights, Miss Kendrick should be the one making commands, but she is a woman, and thus is not able to gain the respect she needs to make such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, no woman in Starship troopers would be able to reach a seriously high level in the military. In order to become a general, and command the overall structure, a soldier has to work his way up through both the navy and the army. Conceivably, a woman could work her way up through the navy, but there is not a single woman in the army, so she could never gain the highest position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the number of women involved in the military, it seems that this power disparity would continue when the women returned from federal service. Rico&#039;s society is strictly militaristic, and the most respected roles are those of the military. It follows that the most respected individuals in the Federal government are those that participate at a high level in military service. In comparison to the size of the army, the navy is very small, in terms of man-power, and not all of the people in the navy are women. As such, the number of male respected citizens would far outweigh the number that are female, and so the women will likely have as little say in the non-military aspects of governance as they do in the military sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final effect of the societal disregard for women firmly marginalizes them in the Starship Troopers universe. They are respected in some small sense, but nevertheless are systematically left out of any important, guiding, decision-making capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
