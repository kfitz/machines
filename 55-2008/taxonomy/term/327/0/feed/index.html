 <title>dialect &amp; language in midnight robber</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/314</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, as the end-of-year-tiredness sets in, I keep on forgetting to do these...sorry about that...anyway, I was in the second group of presenters on Wednesday, and I was the one who talked about dialect and the use of language in the novel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that I noticed while preparing my topic were the correlations drawn between the colonization of Toussaint, the impregnation of a woman, and planting fertile soil. I used two quotes, one from the very beginning of the novel about the arrival of Granny Nanny on the already-inhabited planet: &quot;...like God entering he woman; plunging into the womb of soil to impregnate the plant with the seed of Granny Nanny&quot;(pp.2) and another in which Tan-Tan is explaining her pregnancy: &quot;[My father] rape me...He put this baby in me...He was forever trying to plant me, like I was his soil to harvest&quot;(pp.260) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I noticed at first is that both images seem to allude to rape, especially since the woman (or female-gendered entity, in the case of the land) is treated as an object to be possessed, such as when God enters &quot;he&quot; woman, meaning &quot;his&quot;. However, I&#039;m aware that this can sound like a sexist assumption against men; particularly since God is the one doing the impregnating in the first instance. But, when we&#039;re talking about colonization, we are talking about something forced. I didn&#039;t get to bring this up in class, but one could argue that organized religion is more of an oppressive force than a compassionate representation of God.&lt;br /&gt;
I think that exploring possible rape is an important part of recognizing the struggles of women in a colonized society; but even more interesting are the references to planting, which suggests a positive, life-giving force connected to the rape. This positive light would make more sense if the colonization and/or sexual acts occurred with mutual consent, but clearly that isn&#039;t the case. Perhaps this alludes to the fact that natives of the Caribbean were considered &quot;savages&quot; and told by colonists that their subjugation to &quot;civilized&quot; society was &quot;for their own good&quot; and meant to help them grow or evolve? I think this sounds plausible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&#039;t get much of a response in class, but I was also intrigued by the stream-of-consciousness, almost hip-hop-like language used by the Robber King that Tan-Tan and her mother run into. What is a reader supposed to take from a sentence like &quot;I wrestle the warptenned flying shit from the ensorcelled dungmaster, the master plan blaster in his silver-fendered stratocaster with wings of phoenix flame...&quot; (pp.56). At first I was completely confused; what do Stratocasters and phoenixes have to do with anything? The narration explains that these speeches were always re-told stories about escaping the horrors  of slavery and surviving after their land had been colonized. In other words, it is like a dialect within a dialect; a way of remembering their struggles that their colonizers will not understand and therefore cannot condemn.&lt;br /&gt;
This extremely high level of adaptability is fascinating; when a group of people (by extension this is probably referring to blacks in America) are colonized, enslaved or taken over, they merely mix parts of the conquering culture with their own and continue as before...they are not broken.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/312</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to comment on the time-space things that bothered me in Midnight Robber.  I thought it was interesting how the two parallel worlds developed to be entirely the same, except in one, the humans colonized, and in the other, they didn&#039;t.  It implies to me that there is something about humans which makes them extra-temporal.  Somehow, everything but humans are constrained to carry out the same rolls in these two separate universes.  To me, it implies that there is a physical and tangible aspect to human free-will.  Does this work into the other theme of nanny granny taking playing with human free-will?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Time Travel in Midnight Robber?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/305</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing Midnight Robber, I got to thinking.  There is a lot of talk about how New Half-Way Tree is in a different dimension.  What if instead it was in a different time?  I don&#039;t know exactly what that adds to the work, but it seems to fit better, and explain current Touissant more fully.&lt;br /&gt;
I started thinking about time travel instead of dimensional travel when I first read about the shift pods.  While fairly stock, they made it clear that they were not really moving through space.  The explanation was that they moved through dimensions, but it seemed far easier to explain that they were moving back in time.  I think that New Half-Way Tree is Touissant, but back in time a few hundred years.  This makes it more obvious why the myths of the Midnight Robber and Robber Queen spread so easily.  They could easily have been already passed on to the people of Touissant when they arrived, and found there way into myth enough that eventually Tan-Tan had the motivation to perform acts of legend.  This theory also explains why many of the larger animals are extinct on Touissant, and the Mako Jumbie bird had been domesticated.  There is plenty of time to domesticate the bird if New Half-Way Tree is set a few hundred years back.  It also explains the absence of the Douen, because they could have been eradicated by the humans of New Half-Way Tree before the colony ships ever arrived, relegating them to myths before the culture of Touissant could exert itself.&lt;br /&gt;
	However, this explanation is slightly debunked by Hopkinson&#039;s own narrative.  She does talk about the other dimension a lot throughout the work.  Since this is mostly humans talking, there is no problem with just explaining it as human ignorance.  However, Hopkinson also talks about Grammy Nanny searching through the dimensions to find Tan-Tan, a description that wouldn&#039;t make as much sense if New Half-Way Tree was just back in time.  The time difference though does explain why Grammy Nanny cannot affect anything that happens on New Half-Way tree.  Grammy Nanny would not be able to affect anything before she was created.  This would make the scene with the shift pods more believable too, because the eshu kept talking to Tan-Tan for a reasonable length of time while in the shift pod.  If the shift pod was traveling back in time, then the eshu would have a reasonable amount of time before the pod went to a time before it was created.&lt;br /&gt;
	Still, in the end, time travel doesn&#039;t seem all that likely.  There is only one reason why Hopkinson would state that it was dimensional travel instead of time travel; to show an interesting recursive myth creation that would not add all that much to the story, and create weird paradoxes.  If the myths that Tan-Tan was told were about her it would create a lot of pre-determinism that doesn&#039;t really fit into the story. I like to think that the time travel works, but it doesn&#039;t add enough to the story to justify me shoehorning it into Hopkinson&#039;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>deities in &quot;midnight robber&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/303</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting, yet very briefly discussed, differences between the inhabitants born on Toussaint and those whose ancestry traces far back on New Half-Way Tree is the concept of a higher power, the god-figure.  The humans have Granny-Nanny while the douens have Father Bois.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, this difference can be attributed to the realities from which each species originates.  The douen live in a massive tree that provides them with food, shelter, and water.  If the tree did not take on some level of godhood, it would be confusing.  The humans, contrastingly, are in a technological world, where Granny Nanny is literally inside your head, inescapably from birth.  The Eshu in some respects reminded me of angels.  They are the mouth pieces for Granny-Nanny, who is somewhat incapable of directly speaking to the humans (i.e. the eshu are Alan Rickman in Dogma).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something deeper than this, though.  When the humans are sent to New Half-Way Tree, they are very clearly severed from the Granny-Nanny network, yet they still invoke Granny Nanny much the same people in our world today invoke God in times of mild frustration, taking the name as an oath.  Granny does, however, manage to break through the dimensional barrier (again, godlike omnipresence) and implant herself in Tubman, sowing the seeds for a somewhat perverted messianic story.  The fact that Tubman is a child of incest, and thus of only one parental bloodline, also feeds into this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The douens, on the other hand, see Father Bois as a benevolent figure who simply nurtures and loves.  Chichibud says to Tan-Tan when he finds her under her dead father, &quot;Papa Bois see what really happen in that room, Tan-Tan.  He ain&#039;t judging you&quot; (172).  When he takes her to the home tree, the incarnation of Papa Bois, Chichibud tells Tan-Tan to come in peace and go in friendship (179).  When the douen feel forced to cut down Father Bois, the tree reincarnates with unbelievable speed, creating a strong sense of the a messianic creature, but different from Tubman.  Where Tubman is a bridge, the tree seems to be what is waiting on the other side of the bridge, the incarnation of the return to paradise when creatures are redeemed from The Fall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when Father Bois interacts with the mythic Tan-Tan and Antonio and creates the original Half-Way Tree, there is something vengeful in him at that moment as well.  It seems that there is something inherent to the humans that prevents them from experiencing unconditional benevolence and love from any deity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this dichotomy parallels the versions of God in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  The humans are associated with the vengeful, powerful God of the Old Testament, whereas the douen are a far more peaceful people in and of themselves, and thus can better accept and comprehend the loving, forgiving God of the New Testament.  Taking things away from the Christian Bible, the douen also seem to have developed more f a oneness with nature, whereas the humans fight it, and thus incite conflict from the forces that surround and govern them.  It seems that once again man&#039;s inherent hierarchical tendencies and the violence that springs from these tendencies will be his downfall and stumbling block, no matter where he goes or how low he is dragged down.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>There&#039;s some literary word for this writing style, but I forget what it was</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/298</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Midnight Robber is a novel set apart from most other works of science fiction in its use of a non-Anglo-Saxon culture as the predominant society of its world.  Science Fiction often deals with issues of individuals set apart from the rest of society or set in unfamiliar surroundings, trying to find their way, and so it is somewhat surprising that there are so few examples of Science fiction works written through the lenses of cultures outside of the western/American norm.  Nalo Hopkinson presents a future in which Carribean culture and influence dominates, built through her use of Creole narration and mythologies that depart from westernized norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most conspicuous representation of the novel&#039;s Carribian viewpoint is the use of Creole Language by characters and the Narrative.  The very intro of the book begins with some text describing the main character that, at first glance, might be confused for improper grammar, or just seem incomprehensible for a long while:  &quot;The only thing soft about Tan-Tan is she big, molasses-brown eyes that could look on you, and your heart would start to beat time boopaloops with every flutter of she long eyelashes.  One look in she eyes, and you fall for she already,&quot; (1-2).  Once a reader comes to understanding the grammar structures and wording methodologies a bit better, though, the text becomes almost as easy to read as regular English prose, but gives the added cultural element to keep the reader immersed in the story.  The character dialogues are similarly presented in Creole, keeping the image that the entire world, not just our main character, is based upon Carribean culture rather than western societal constructs.  One exchange goes as follows: &quot; &#039;I not leaving you!&#039; &#039;She not going anywhere with you, you pissant wretch!&#039; &#039;Go, Melonhead, or it just go be worse!&#039; &#039;You sure?&#039; &#039;Yes! I go come talk to you later,&#039; &quot; (166).  As previously mentioned, this at first glance appears to be bad grammar, but gives an authenticity otherwise completely lost by correcting the speech patterns of Creole pidgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkinson further involves Creole by using mythologies based in the realm of the novel and its Carribean roots.  The majority of tales involve trickery, or &quot;anansi story&quot; as it is called in the introduction, referring to an African legend of Anansi the Spider, a great being who greatly helped out mankind but also was a trickster.  In the tale of Tan-Tan and Dry Bone, the entire plot is centered around the two characters trying to out-trick each other to get their way; In Dry Bone&#039;s case to be perpetually cared for by Tan-Tan, and Tan-Tan trying to get rid of him.  Tan-Tan finally wins out by tricking Dry Bones to going out onto her porch by weaving an image of a veranda suited for a king, playing to his ego to bring about his downfall at the hands of Master Johncrow, who takes Dry Bone away into the sky (211).  While Western myths deal with trickery, the Carribean and African influenced myths present in the story seem almost entirely comprised of subterfuge as a means to all ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midnight Robber&#039;s basis in Carribean and African culture allow for a more immersive reading experience, and help to create a realm that is, sadly, more alien than most standard works of science fiction which are based on western culture.  By taking readers into this other culture, she can create a fictitious world with so many real world elements, yet still have it be alien and unique.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Importance of language</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/296</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What struck me most about Nalo Hopkinson&#039;s Midnight Robber was not any of the obvious subjects addressed in the novel: race and gender issues, rape, incest, self-love, self-respect, etc; rather, the language she used to discuss these things was so exact in its strange dialect and such a crucial part of the novel. In most of the novels we have read thus far, there is some strange vocabulary that helps define the strange world we read about, but in general, the language in which the author tells the story is easily understandable. It is not so in Midnight Robber, where this Afro-Caribbean dialect is not reserved for dialogue but used in narration as well. The effect of this is that the reader must constantly pay attention to what is being said or he will miss the meaning of the words. Indeed, as I was reading it, if I started to scan paragraphs I would have to go back and re-read them because I really couldn&#039;t understand what had just happened in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are certain words that, like previous SF novels, are completely made up by the author. &quot;Headblind,&quot; &quot;nannysong,&quot; &quot;eshu,&quot; and &quot;datastock&quot; are a few of these. &quot;Headblind&quot; refers to objects or situations that Granny Nanny, the omniscient and omnipresent computer, doesn&#039;t have access to; in other words, she is blind to them. One such item is real paper; the current equivalent, which Granny Nanny does have access to, is datastock, something that seems similar to word processing for documents. The sing-song phrases used to communicate with Granny Nanny and the house eshu are called nannysong, for obvious reasons. The eshu is a little less obvious; similar to Granny Nanny, it seems, it has no physical presence but exists within the &quot;living&quot; house simply as a.i. consciousness, and can control much of how the house operates (ie changing walls into mirrors when asked). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These made-up words are expected, almost clichÃ© when it comes to science fiction, but real words--at least slang that is actually used in certain dialects--is not, and is much harder to read. In fact, it is unclear whether many of the unknown words are Hopkinson&#039;s creation or real slang, though probably the latter. &quot;Allyou&quot; is a pretty obvious word; a much better known term would be &quot;y&#039;all,&quot; and certainly means the same thing. On the other hand, &quot;pickney&quot; takes a while to figure out, but seems to refer to children, especially young and tricky ones. While &quot;doux-doux&quot; is unfamiliar to most Americans, it is not really slang, as it comes from the French word that means &quot;sweet,&quot; and is obviously used as a term of endearment. &quot;Nuh&quot; and &quot;seen&quot; are a bit more difficult, however; &quot;nuh&quot; is apparently used similarly to its cousin &quot;no&quot; as questioning the previous statement. &quot; &#039;Daddy, let we go home, nuh?&#039; &quot; (Hopkinson 72). Here, the equivalent would be, &quot;Can&#039;t we go home?&quot; Conversely, &quot;seen&quot; is a statement of agreement or acknowledgment (like &quot;okay&quot;), wherein the speaker has &quot;seen&quot; the import of the listener&#039;s previous words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary is not the only confusing part of Hopkinson&#039;s language, however; the grammar is what makes the novel truly difficult to read, at least until one has gotten used to it. For instance, possessive pronouns are most often the same as our usual subject pronouns: &quot;She two arms hard with muscle . . .&quot; (1); and subject and object pronouns seem to have switched places: &quot; &#039;Them does only pay a pittance compared to we&#039; &quot; (8). Subject and verb are sometimes switched, verb form is seldom &quot;correct&quot;--in all, it can be quite a confusing read for anyone. What we must consider is, since books are meant to be read (and this one is likely intended for an audience who does not speak the novel&#039;s dialect), why make it so difficult to read? For one thing, the main aspect of culture lies in its language, so Hopkinson immerses the reader into her obviously different world immediately. Moreover, and more importantly, because the language makes the reader stumble and pick his way through, it forces him to concentrate better on what is being said. True, the reading will get easier as he makes his way through the novel and gets used to its style, but it still will catch him if he starts slacking off in attention because it is never a natural way of forming sentences in his brain. In this way, Hopkinson achieves the ultimate goal of an author: to make her reader immerse himself completely in the story and concentrate on what she is telling him.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hopkinson&#039;s Anti-Posthumanism</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/291</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is a topic we talked about a little in class today, but since my paper is on posthumanism, I&#039;m having a little trouble thinking about anything else, so I&#039;m going to go for it anyways.&lt;br /&gt;
To my mind, this is one of the most anti-posthumanist novels we&#039;ve read thus far in the class, which I find most interesting considering just how little the novel exposes us to advanced technology, since most of the storyline takes place in the primitive society of New Half-Way Tree.  Hopkinson does a little bit of the typical anti-transhumanism presentation in the obvious perversity of a theoretically positive advance. Generally speaking, I get so caught up in the storyline of a novel that I have a hard time picking up on subtle undertones, components of a universe that are overtly presented as positive, when really maybe we&#039;re supposed to see them as nefarious.  I have the worst time with unpleasant technological advances, because my first inclination is to think of technology as progressive.  But when Ione realizes the sheriffs are arresting Antonio and says &quot;Nanny save we!&quot; I was profoundly disturbed (64).  The grand anansi is so powerful, that its nickname is used in place of God.  It happens again, after he finds out Quashee is dead, Antonio says &quot;Nanny have mercy&quot; where the implied continued thought is â€¦on my soul (70).  Nanny has become so pervasive that people are essentially praying to a machine for salvation.  There&#039;s also the very creepy final passage, when we realize that the nanobots have made their way into Tan-Tan&#039;s child, without Tan-Tan&#039;s consent, let alone the child&#039;s.&lt;br /&gt;
I also see the novel as anti-transhumanist in its absolute corporeality. One of the overarching goals for posthumanists is to fully disengage from the body, and become an unbounded entity in cyberspace, or some analogous structure, as we saw with Case in Neuromancer.  Nalo Hopkinson rejects disembodiment and fully embraces the importance of corporal reality.  We see this, as mentioned in class, in the fact that the technology (nanomites) inhabits the body, rather than having the mind moving into cyberspace.  I also see it in Tan-Tan&#039;s pregnancy.  Incorporating such a purely physical phenomenon into the story reinforces the importance of the corporal over the ethereal.  I also read Brown Girl in the Ring, and see a similar trend in that novel as well.  Again, the human bodies are possessed, and actually physically changed by the spirits.  The main character resolves a conflict by hands-on fighting, which we haven&#039;t seen much of previously in this class.  In an altered state, she lifts a man off the ground with two fingers.  The most powerful force in the book, the duppy-bowl is powered by human blood rather than code, thoughts, or information, and to break its power, the main character has to break a physical object, which, once broken, reveals all the physical things its made of: &quot;reeking clumps of dirt; a twist of hair; white knuckle bones; the black, mummified body of what looked like a dead cat&quot; (204).  The final showdown then makes the conflict explicit.  The villain says &quot;that body don&#039;t have to be your home no more. You don&#039;t have to feel pain no more, sweetheart.  Your granddaddy could help you.  After I speak the right words, the powder you take will give your spirit strength to act on it own, without the body.  Let your spirit talk to me&quot; (216).  And though over the course of the novel, the main character expresses a fair amount of discontent with her body, she overcomes that discontent and rejects becoming a disembodied entity, regardless of the pain her body sometimes brings.&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I thought it was very cool that Hopkinson could push away technology not only using the typical presentation of a seemingly benevolent technology gone horribly, horribly wrong, but also through a very firm embrace of the natural, corporeal world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Eshu</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about how Hopkinson&#039;s dialect critiques the normal technology-centric language of science fiction books, and the name &quot;Eshu&quot; came to mind. Looking it up on Wikipedia reveals some cool things (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&quot; title=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eshu&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a mythological character from &quot;Yoruba mythology and related New World traditions&quot; who protects travelers -- definitely makes sense as a choice of terminology for a &#039;smart house&#039; that can help you out even when you&#039;re on the road. At the same time, Eshu was all about teaching people lessons, so maybe it makes sense that human nature (wanting to have privacy to do more-sneaky things) forces Antonio to try and get away from Eshu&#039;s all-knowing/all-seeing watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douen comes from Afro-Carribean mythology, too (Yoruba = west Africa), as part of Trinidadian mythology they were the forest-dwelling spirits of lost (unbaptized?) children (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caribbeantales.ca/ct_newsletter/archives/your_story/1/the_douen/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
