 <title>The Primacy of Representation?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/121</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;To follow up on our &quot;uncontroversial&quot; class discussion yesterday, I wanted to offer some thoughts that will hopefully lead to greater analytical synergy between the two majoritary viewpoints being expressed, namely, a) dominant systems of representation (of which language is one example) are exclusionary insofar as they prohibit the expression of positions (identitarian, political, etc.) that diverge from normative standards, versus b) systems of representations always reflects the proclivities of their agents (e.g., humans who use language) and therefore present deficiencies will necessarily work themselves out--or in its inverse formulation, if present deficiencies don&#039;t work themselves out, then they weren&#039;t even deficiencies in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously these positions don&#039;t seem formally incompatible, which begs the question: What was at stake in the in-class debate? On the whole, the dividing wedge came down to discrepancies apropos of the question of agency--how much control does the individual have over the systems of representations that she uses to express her positionality in the world? How much does the onus to change systems of representation reside with the individuals impacted by their putatively &quot;adverse&quot; effects? The pure libertarian response would be &quot;completely,&quot; whereas the pure social constructivist response would be &quot;not at all.&quot; The polemical stand-off between these two positions can, of course, proceed ad infinitum (indeed, without much to show for it), but I think it&#039;s worthwhile to consider qualitative differences between the distinct modes by which discourses, institutions, and social practices produce our self-reflexive individuality. There is an important difference between 1) social construction that stops individuals from expressing themselves, and 2) social construction that depicts an &quot;illusory&quot; field of social relations in such way as to obscure concrete antagonisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is basically what&#039;s up for grabs in the agency v. social determinism debate, to which, again, it&#039;s hard not to respond with copious yawning. The latter, however, is indispensable for making sense of what it means to excercise one&#039;s agency in the world. One discursive thread from the libertarian side in class yesterday was that culture and sociality define our systems of representations and not vice versa. However, considering that systems of representation inevitably delimit the ways that we conceptualize precisely what constitute &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;sociality,&quot; our ability to discern and grapple critically with concrete antagonisms will be limited at best. How can we claim, for instance, that gender neutral pronouns will &quot;emerge&quot; (by some magically transmutive process, it seems) exactly when gender confusion becomes a socio-cultural issue if no systems of representations are in place to alert people who remain unaffected by gender confusion of its problematic status? In other words, there might be problems, at one level, for gender-queer individuals who want to express their position but can&#039;t find the semiotic tools to do so. Much more acute, however, is the meta-level problem: that without active changes in the language, no semiotic channels exist to facilitate other people&#039;s awareness about the social antagonisms borne out of gender confusion. How can we possibly expect, e.g., English speakers to transform their language in order to reflect concrete antagonisms if the language itself is constantly working to systematically obscure such antagonisms? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final thought: It misses the point of social constructivist criticism to fall back on the &quot;we can never account for all minority positions [so therefore we shouldn&#039;t even try]!&quot; narrative that has become nauseatingly commonplace in discursive backlash against so-called &quot;identity politics&quot; (it&#039;s more than slightly ironic that purveyors of such backlash tend to employ the same &quot;victimizing&quot; language that the purport to despise [e.g., it shouldn&#039;t be the labor of white people to account for EVERY SINGLE minority status imagineable --&amp;gt; white people have become the victims [!]). Destabilized libidinal matrices notwithstanding, I&#039;m sincerely unsure what &quot;threat&quot; this narrative is responding to, since no one&#039;s demanding that EVERY SINGLE minority status become the object of collective sympathy, some brand of social reparations, etc. If normativity and marginality are bound in an inextricable dialectic to one another, then certain positions will always be majoritary and others minoritary. The important point of social constructivist theory is to underscore the ideological arbitrarity of what has come to occupy the center and margin respectively--and in terms of social practice, to continually explore how seemingly &quot;natural&quot; hierarchies are, in fact, arbitrary, and furthermore, how they reinforce socio-historically specific power arrangements. Surely we can keep such a space of interrogation open without it amounting to an insurmountable burden for majoritary subjects. Indeed, it is difficult to see anything beyond the crude and puerile re-inscription of traditional White-hetero-normative domination in chest-pounding arguments to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Utopia and Reasonability (Atwood response)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/109</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to further explore two interrelated strands of discussion from last class: on the one hand, the consequences of Atwood&#039;s rendering her dystopia with fidelity to certain internal currents of various socio-political developments in the 1980&#039;s (e.g., Reaganism, porn-burning feminism, the &quot;breakdown&quot; of the East-West Cold War-era binary, etc.); and on the other, the political implications of distinguishing between &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;dogmatic&quot; forms of an ideological system (a distinction which was invoked at least once in an attempt to explain the basis of 1980&#039;s &quot;anti-feminist&quot; backlash [of which Atwood&#039;s text may or may not be an example]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stake in both cases is the question of what to make of the structural gap between the theoretical mandates of a given social order&#039;s foundational and the practical mandates of its &quot;actually existing&quot; manifestation. Can this gap ever be closed, which is to say, can ideology-on-paper and implementation-in-the-world ever overlap fully? Slavoj Zizek contends that it cannot, and his reasoning is as follows: because the call of ideology is never &quot;pure&quot;--its coercive, positive claims (e.g., Be a good person! Share with others!) are necessarily supplemented by its internally transgressive &quot;seedy underside,&quot; which disrupts its positive claims from within (e.g. Be a good person! Share with others! [unless you decide that transnational business is your passion, in which case, by all means follow your heart...])--the actualization of a given ideological system is predicated on the disavowal of certain internal mandates of said system. In other words, the &quot;imperfection&quot; of ideology-in-practice is already present in ideology-in-form. Zizek&#039;s account suggests that internal disavowals are not the mark of ideology&#039;s mis-actualization (as though the &quot;real thing&quot; is lurking there somewhere behind its butchered form), but rather its proper actualization. Thus, throwing out the inconvenient and/or (ostensibly) non-sensical dimensions of ideology--a political manuever that we tend to laud as &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot;--becomes the gesture of ideology par excellence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, &quot;reasonable&quot; positions--as well as their formal basis, the overarching injunction to &quot;Be reasonable!&quot;--are critically bankrupt. In fact, whereas we generally conceive of &quot;ideological&quot; (in the connotative sense of moronically inexorable) positions as easy to maintain--essentially a *pre-critical* position that relies on utter blindness to the empirical reality that &quot;extremism never works&quot;--Zizek&#039;s analysis of ideology as internally split leads us to precisely the opposite conclusion: &quot;ideological&quot; positions that stubbornly refuse to break from the formal mandates a given ideology, even when such mandates seem &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;unreasonable,&quot; are, in fact, the hardest positions to live by. Indeed, does not the &quot;non-ideological&quot; position--the &quot;reasonable&quot; position that willfully amends its principles on cue, and thereby facilitates the continual reinscription of hegemony--exemplify the very notion of an easy position? What could be easier than amending one&#039;s viewpoint according to the shifting winds of whatever seems &quot;reasonable&quot; (or more to the point, what &quot;expert&quot; techno-crats tell us is reasonable) at the time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#039;s at stake when Atwood takes the dominant ideologies (of her contemporaneous moment) to their extreme, utilizing their internal logic as the basis of socio-political critique? I&#039;d suggest that we should read The Handmaid&#039;s Tale as a work of &quot;critical heresy,&quot; understanding &quot;heresy&quot; as the refusal to perform the disavowals necessary to found an ideological system in practice, and simply maintaining the ideology in its pure form. The heretic is, for all intents and purposes, the figure who refuses the constitutive of auto-transgressions of systems of power, and thereby takes the logical underpinning of systemic domination to its internal (and often absurd) limit-point. The heretic thus steps outside of ideology precisely by staying within it. (This is precisely the basis of the resistive capacity that Zizek locates in hyper-conformity--stepping outside the confines of Law precisely by staying fully and uncompromisingly within them.) Atwood&#039;s heretical inclinations stem from socio-political malaise. She&#039;s not arguing that The Handmaid&#039;s Tale depicts a Utopian landscape whose conditions should be brought to their &quot;actually existing&quot; form in the real-world; rather, she&#039;s attempting to undermine the ideological fabric of her historical moment by taking it to its &quot;natural&quot; extreme. In fact, seems as though this mode of heresy--understood as the impulse to take an ideology &quot;more seriously than it takes itself&quot;--operates in many science-fictional narratives (toward equally progressive and reactionary ends, we should note). We tend to think that critique is most potent when it underscores how social arrangements are failing, but it can be far more subversive to highlight when such arrangements are working perfectly--though to horrific ends.&lt;/p&gt;
