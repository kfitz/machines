 <title>sex as the alien in lilith&#039;s brood (vols 2 and 3)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/190</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I went into more depth with this line of thought in my paper, but for some reason the Lilith&#039;s Brood trilogy got me thinking about how the subject (and act, ultimately) of sex is treated by our society, and why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vastly different attitudes of the humans and the Oankali towards sex is significant; it reveals itself is through language and the characters&#039; actions. The Oankali talk about &quot;sharing&quot; sex; the humans talk about &quot;having&quot; or &quot;getting&quot; it. In the human view, it is almost like a possession itself, or a method of possessing a partner. To the Oankali, it is a biological necessity for reproduction, but there is also a ritualistic element to it that is almost sacred. Humans use sex as a weapon (as in rape) to subjugate or control others; or, sex is demonized and treated as sinful or &quot;perverse&quot;. Humans make sex into something that is unnatural, &quot;other&quot; and &quot;alien&quot; in this way; which is reinforced by the fact that the Oankali, an alien species, embrace sexuality. It seems that the Oankali also use sex as a device, but to bring people together and deepen their intimacy, as Nikanj does with Lilith and Joseph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that the main flaw in my theory is that some of the Oankali sexual interaction with humans seems coerced, even forced. For example, when Nikanj is seducing Joseph, he says &quot;You see, your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (pp 189, Dawn). Does Nikanj somehow know what Joseph truly wants, or is it taking away his free will? In the same way, Nikanj tells Lilith &quot;You&#039;ll have a daughter, and you are ready to be her mother. You could never have said so. Just as Joseph could never have invited me into his bed, no matter how much he wanted me there. Nothing about you but your words reject this child&quot; (pp 247, Dawn).  The mind is supposed to be one of the fundamental things that a person controls about themselves; surely this control is not taken away so easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professed goal of the Oankali colonization is to allow humans to &quot;have a chance to live on your Earth, not just to die on it&quot; (pp 32, Dawn). And indeed, they do go about teaching them how to survive in strange terrain without killing unnecessarily. This preference for nonviolence is admirable. However, the realization that sexuality is not &quot;alien&quot; but natural is also a goal. Nikanj puts it, &quot;Let them learn that it isn&#039;t shameful to be together with one another and with us&quot; (pp 200, Dawn). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trilogy, readers may sit back and find that they have embraced or at least accepted the idea of a third &#039;both-gender&#039; sex like the ooloi. The novel&#039;s depiction of sex as &quot;alien&quot; and yet inherently human is meant to encourage readers to critique societal attitudes that condemn sexuality as demonic, sinful or something to be feared. Butler&#039;s critique should lead us to question why our society treats open sexuality, appreciation of pleasure, and unconventional gender identities as &quot;alien&quot;. As the fate of the earliest humans in the novel suggests, these tendencies seem to ultimately lead to sexual repression, cyclical violence and the destruction of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler&#039;s trilogy started with a bang, and ended with a whimper. The last part of imago seemed to me to be the most boring part of any of her books.  It also had the most Deus ex machina.  Of course the series is supposed to be SF, but most scenes were well explained.  It was never satisfactorily resolved how all of a sudden there was a fertile colony of humans around.  Somehow someone was raped and found to be fertile, but apparently she was the only one.  And that these fertile resisters had a hidden location where both other resisters and the oankali could not find them rang false.  The resisters had been searching pretty closely for other humans to raid, and they knew that people in hard to reach spots would be the most likely to be fertile, the resister raiders should have found the fertile village long ago.  There is a better reason why the oankali didn&#039;t know about the village, because they never actively searched out resister villages so long as they left others alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to my main point.  Octavia Butler&#039;s work seems to be filled with Deus ex machina.  While those scenes in imago were the most obvious parts, looking back through the work, there are many scenes where something happens just so that it will work out later.  Now of course, writers are allowed to do this to make their story turn out the way they want to, but there seemed to be too many coincidences which made the story slightly less believable.  In imago, meeting humans only a few days out of Lo was one such scene.  In Adulthood Rights, Akin being captured was another.  In fact, all of Akin was a coincidence.  Why were males so much harder to create than females never seemed accurately explained, and why Akin was the only one also seemed strange?  It seemed as if Butler wanted a hero who was unique and powerful to maintain interest, and so a normal rank and file oankali would not do, only a one of a kind construct.  Then, it turned out that he was to speak for the human race after being trained by an akjai ooloi.  It didn&#039;t seem like any other oankali received that privilege, but Akin did.  In the first work, there were also scenes which didn&#039;t ring true.  Almost all violent reactions to Lillith seemed strange to me.  These reactions appear constructed with second glances, because they don&#039;t seem to have any thought process behind them.  They were made to further the story rather than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavia Butler uses a lot of Deus Ex Machina to further the story, at least in my opinion.  Used in small doses, this can be helpful, but in too many parts of her story, it makes it ring false.&lt;/p&gt;
