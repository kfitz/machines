 <title>Liliths - Response 5</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/161</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My reaction to Lilith&#039;s Brood after just reading the title was to think, &quot;Lilith! What a terrible name for parents to give their child!&quot; I didn&#039;t know too much about Lilith, other than that she was supposed to be the first wife of Adam, according to apocryphal texts, and that she supposedly killed children. From where I was coming from, that didn&#039;t seem like the best name for parents to give their daughter, although I was intrigued as to how the choice of name would play out in the three books. For instance Tino, upon hearing her name, remarks that it is an &quot;unusual name loaded with bad connotations&quot; (285). I have to agree, although it could very well be that he is just referring to the stories he as heard about Lilith Iyapo. Nonetheless, many of the stories of Lilith Iyapo have interesting parallels with various stories of Lilith. So, I it would be a good idea to read up a little more on the background of Lilith and the various stories surrounding her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that she was much more than just the child killer and first wife of Adam that I had originally thought and that many of the earlier traits ascribed to her are clearly reflected in the character in the text.  In early Sumerian texts she was a demon who would visit men in the night and have children by them. This notion of her as a child bearing demon continues into the Talmudic period where, according to Raphael Patai, she was unhappy as Adam&#039;s first wife so she fled and went to the Red Sea where she &quot;engaged in unbridled promiscuity, and bore  a demonic brood of more than one hundred a day&quot; (Patai 296). Woah!  A brood! Lilith&#039;s bearing of a demonic brood relates very well to the perception of Butler&#039;s Lilith by the resisters.  Lilith herself raises the objection early in Dawn, terrified after learning how her children will no longer be human, she fears that the Oankali will &quot;make mules of our children sterile monsters&quot; (55). The resisters see the children as just that, monsters, the demon brood, and they perceive her children as the end of the human race. They are not human and they are the ones who are going to repopulate the planet, not the human race which the Oankali claim to have been saving. Having been previously unaware of this aspect of the story of Lilith, I thought it was very interesting that the title seems to suggest there is possibly something demonic, or at least unhuman, about her children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilith is also concerned with childbirth. According to sources cited by Patai, women would recite certain incantations to protect themselves from the complications that she could cause in child birthing. In fact, it was possible for her to cause sterility. In a way resistors blamer her for much of what has happened. She is there Judas goat (245) and it is because of her, or at least can be seen to because of her, that the human race will no longer survive. The human race is now sterile without the Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also texts which tell of Lilith as being the wife of Samael (Patai 308).  Where Adam was, at least, human, Lilith is now the wife of a demon. The Oankali in the minds of the resistors? And here again there is the fear that they might fill with world with &quot;their demonic brood&quot; so God takes it upon himself to castrate Samael. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallels with the different religious and mythological Liliths and the role of Lilith Iyapo as seen from the resistors point of view was an aspect of Dawn and Adulthood Rites that I thought was very interesting, especially not knowing much about the history of Lilith. The demonic aspect of her through history and her demonic children who threaten to fill the world, fit well with the fears of the resistors who believe that the construct children are not human and yet they will be the ones to inherit the restored Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s the link to the article I read which does a great job tracing the changes of Lilith:&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Despair/Religion in Cyberpunk</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/80</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed that seems to characterize cyberpunk is a constant sense of despair. When the limits of biology and existence itself are stretched and reshaped, it&#039;s not surprising that religious notions of the soul and higher planes of existence become less and less meaningful. Most of the technological advancements in the book seem sacrilegious in some way;  when Case is jacked into Molly&#039;s consciousness, there are two beings residing in one body, Dixie&#039;s existence demonstrates that human consciousness doesn&#039;t require flesh, and Wintermute creates Armitage just as effectively as the basic principles of biology created Corto. Some of the basic assumptions of human existence have been challenged, thanks to miraculous scientific development, and there is effectively nothing to look up to (did anyone find a mention of anything resembling a church in the book?). Blade Runner seemed to make this point a bit more explicitly (very subtle symbolism as Batty dies at the end, I thought), so I thought I&#039;d bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly religious imagery pops up here and there. Part of the burlesque replicant&#039;s introduction is &quot;Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent... that once corrupted man.&quot;, and Batty ascends to the top of the skyscraper to destroy the man who created him, after he has proved his intellect (the man happens to be wearing all white, for some reason). Blade Runner seems to offer a universe where Neuromancer&#039;s technologically-based demystification of humanity has reached its apex, and people simply create more people, building in a finite lifespan for good measure, and inventing a test so they can know who they are (interestingly, an &quot;empathy test&quot;, as Tyrell summarizes it). And once memories get involved, and the distinction becomes less and less apparent, the only separation that seems valid is the religiously-motivated one, that while the end result may be the same, the way in which life was brought into the universe must have some bearing on the value of that life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliffs notes version: When the boundaries that are stretched in a science fiction novel are not physical and spatial (spaceships, faster-than-light travel, etc.), but biological and existential, you&#039;re destined to end up with some pretty messed up characters.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Space-rastas and Doctor Who (aka Response #2)</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/47</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just finished reading Neuromancer, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I&#039;ve never read any cyberpunk before, so it was certainly an interesting read.  For some reason I am drawn to the idea of an imperfect future where things are grungy and gross and the people are flawed. I suppose it seems to me like a more realistic version of the future than one in which everyone gets along and there is no poverty and crime (i.e. the Star Trek universe). Perhaps I have little faith in humanity?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple things that interested me in Neuromancer. The first was the role of the Rastafarians. It almost seemed like they were the religious aspect of the story.  At the very least, Gibson certainly seemed interested in bringing certain aspects of that culture into his story.  For instance, there are many references to Babylon. The Founders of Zion are willing to help Molly and Case because they will &quot;bring a scourge on Babylon&quot; and &quot;may serve as a tool of Final Days&quot; (109-110).  In Rastafarian culture Babylon is corrupt society (I suppose in the book it would be the Sprawl and other Earth and non Rastafarian cultures in general), whereas Zion (in the book the home of the Rastafarians) is good. Zion also has connections to Africa which in turn makes me think back to Marcus Garvey and the Back-to-Africa movement. I don&#039;t remember my history too well here, but since the name of the tug was Marcus Garvey I think I am making a valid connection. There was also a connection made between Molly and &quot;Steppin&#039; Razor&quot; which was a song by Peter Tosh who was a reggae musician (109). On the other hand, the Rastafarians seemed rather one-dimensional and stereotypical. They were constantly getting high and spoke with very thick accents and they just didn&#039;t seem to have too much substance.  They&#039;re characters seem set in their ways and just less fleshed out than the others. This has led me to wonder exactly what Gibson&#039;s purpose was in using the Rastafarian culture as part of his story. He delves into many other cultures and subcultures in particular the Panther Moderns, but I&#039;m unclear as to what made him pick Rastafarians in particular as the allies of Case, Molly and Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I also really liked the use of technology. It kept amazing me that the book was written back in the early 1980s. The whole concept of the matrix and cyberspace and virtual reality has always been something I thought of a relatively new, so his use of these ideas in the early 80s I thought was very forward thinking. The idea of hacking into systems and spreading viruses seems so current! One thing that I wasn&#039;t too keen on, however, was the all the product placement (for lack of a better term). There was Sony here, Hitachi there, and then there were the little microsoft slivers used by the Panther Moderns.  On the one hand I found this annoying because it made the universe that Gibson created seem less foreign. On the other hand the dominance of certain corporations in the technology industry can&#039;t be denied and the use of big company names seemed to make that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I suppose, I am left with two questions. Why did Gibson choose to use Rastafarian culture so prominently in the novel? While he certainly brings out many aspects of Rastafarian culture and religion, he never goes much deeper into the characters themselves which is disappointing. Second, why the brand names? Was it meant to make a connection between their time and ours? Or to show how technology as an industry is dominated by large corporations? I&#039;m just uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as I was writing this I remembered a Doctor Who serial which features a computer program called the Matrix! In the show it was a sort of virtual reality that a person could &quot;jack into&quot; using a big thing that came down over their head. I&#039;m pretty sure that this episode was from the mid 1970s which would predate the novelâ€¦ interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
