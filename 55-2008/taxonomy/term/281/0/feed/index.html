 <title>Slow River Response</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest questions of morality I saw (and the class talked about) was how Lore never acknowledges the other side of the monopoly argument.  As far as she is concerned, since the van de Oest products are superior to the others, they have the right to dominate the market.  As the son of two educators from a middleclass family, this was about as opposite my thought patterns as possible. The grand revelation she has about her family&#039;s rise to monopoly was all focused on the corruption behind it, not on the nature of the monopoly itself.  This was even after all of her work with Spanner and at the water-purification facility.  The way that Hepple acts is nearly identical to the way the younger Lore reacts to the worker problems on the Russia job, and to her own mother&#039;s response to the families of the children crippled by mistakes in the purification systems.  Between having a peon-level job and having such a money-grubbing, careless boss as Hepple,  I would have thought she would come to revise her opinion of her family&#039;s methods at least a little.  But no, the fault was in Hepple not choosing the expensive superior brand, not the producer&#039;s fault in making the bacteria absolutely dependent on one set of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  After all of her time spent on money schemes with Spanner, it surprised me that she would be naÃ¯ve enough to never recognize how much of a chokehold this kind of production has on the market.  I would say that she believed that her family would never stoop so low as to extort their buyers unjustly, but the way she herself describes her family&#039;s instabilities and lack of empathy rules this out.  She is an odd mix of self-consciousness, guilt, and bewilderment, and only resolves to change at the end of the novel.  Even then, this change is more of an acceptance of the way she feels than an actual resolution to make change things.  I am not saying that this isn&#039;t a monumental step for her, but I just thought things would turn out differently, perhaps with a bit more of a wide-scale change in the world.  Having finally sorted out the true story, she finally decides to return to her family and money, but takes with her the woman representative of all of her struggles.  It just seems like everything worked out too happily for her.  Also, I would like to know more about everyone she left behind, specifically Tom, Kinnis, Cel, and Hepple too.  I was wondering if anything would happen between her and Tom, romantic or not, even with her prior sexual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
