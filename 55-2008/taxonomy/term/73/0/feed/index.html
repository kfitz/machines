 <title>The Stephenson Bias</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/273</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On page 57 of Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson describes the problem that the Black Sun staff has understanding Juanita&#039;s work as &quot;sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.&quot;  To some degree, it seems that he may be, intentionally or not, describing himself.&lt;br /&gt;
	For a male author whose work contains so many female protagonists, Stephenson tends to write them into surprisingly familiar paradigms.  While it&#039;s relatively subtle, his heroines tend to function as sex objects, and operate around the men among them.   Juanita, for instance, despite being the most broadly functional holder of the information in the Babel/Infocalypse stack, abdicates a large portion of the responsibility involved in order to do relatively academic research.  The &#039;real work&#039; of unraveling L. Bob Rife&#039;s evil master plan is left to the men: Mr. Lee, Uncle Enzo, Ng, and Hiro, who, most of the time seems to be involved primarily to the end of getting back together with Juanita.  Even Y.T. describes her as &quot;that piece of tailâ€¦&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Y.T., while pretty much as empowered as anyone can get, is rather disenfranchised, for the simple reason of being 15, and possessing the maturity level of a 15 year old.  She&#039;s mostly just playing with the power she has as a middle class white girl in America, until she&#039;s kidnapped and brought to the Raft.  When she ends up in an unfamiliar place, living as she realizes much of the world lives, she gets scared and stays in her place.  She too ends up needing a man to come rescue her, and once again, Raven ends up helping her cause trouble purely because he&#039;s enamored of her physical charms.&lt;br /&gt;
The frustrating thing about Stephenson is that he&#039;s clearly trying.  Most of his work, and all of his recent work, is built around strong, driven female characters.  However, their power is consistently derived in a fairly traditional form.  Eliza, of the Baroque cycle, possesses astounding business acumen, but is still far more successful at acquiring power through sex, marriage and subtle politicking.  Princess Nell of The Diamond Age takes her astounding skill set and works as a writer for a bordello.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, this may be a critique of Stephenson&#039;s reader base.  His fans consist, in great part of the very same type of well-intentioned male techies he&#039;s describing, each thinking, as they read the sentence, that he&#039;s talking about someone else.  Perhaps the forms of power with which Stephenson endows his female characters are those he thinks will go down most smoothly, and  make the most impression in the end.  Or maybe it&#039;s just disturbing that a smart, thoughtful, modern male science fiction writer still can&#039;t give the women in his novels power unmediated by men.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Could talk some more about race, but...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/266</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is defined from the second page as someone who kicks ass: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment of his and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren&#039;t afraid of the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords require no demonstrations&quot; (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some satiric bite to Stephenson&#039;s picture of America as a cross between a streetfight and an NRA convention, but there is rather more to the violence than necessary that particular aim. Which is not to say that Stephenson worries to much about wearing his jokes out, or even advancing the plot smoothly. But there is another motive behind all this--it&#039;s central to Hiro&#039;s development as a character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street cimre. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.  Hiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken&quot; (271)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not plot that drives the violence of the book. It is not satire, either. It isn&#039;t even the congenital obsession of science fiction--the invention of new and amusing ways for characters to fold, spindle and mutilate each other. It is the way Hiro grows. We know he likes swords, we know that he no longer wants to be the world&#039;s baddest motherfucker, and we know that he can administer the coup de grace when he must.  Big parts of Hiro&#039;s personality, as Stephenson presents it, are caught up in the way he fights, and how he feels about that fighting. This seems, somehow, caught up in the way that he constructs gender--when he says all men under twenty-five, he means all men. If it were only Hiro, perhaps this could be overlooked. But it&#039;s not only Hiro, though. All three of the main male characters in SC are killers--Hiro, Raven and Uncle Enzo.  YT, a fifteen-year old girl, also fights when she has to, but it&#039;s non-lethal. She has a sonic skateboard that breaks glass, and pepper spray, and bracelets that give people shocks, but she doesn&#039;t use swords, or guns, or nuclear weapons. But it&#039;s Hiro&#039;s ex-girlfriend, the linguistic hacker Juanita, who shows the difference between men and women in Stephenson most explicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;First things first,&quot; Juanita says. &quot;The control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Okay, you get ready to grab the tablet, and I&#039;ll take out the control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;How are you going to do that? By cutting people up with swords?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yeah. That&#039;s the only thing they&#039;re good for.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Let&#039;s do it the other way around,&quot; Juanita says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence is intended to make the book more entertaining, at least--science fiction readers buy books much more preoccupied with killing than Snow Crash. And it is partly satirical, and Hiro is mocked (gently, compared to the treatment that just about everyone and everything else in the book gets) for it, but there is also a bonding between him and Raven, and Raven and Enzo, over their willingness to fight. A willingness that is needed, to survive in, and save, the America of the future.  For all his parodying, I think that Stephenson, whose vision of America is all the more nightmarish because it is one big free-fire zone, thinks this willingness is worthy of praise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing that concerns me, partly because of the way this novel follows Slow River in our Syllabus: in the not-too-distant future of cyberpunk, Is homosexuality an anachronism? After reading a few cyberpunk novels, I am beginning to wonder about the future of the love that dares not speak its name. Whether due to authorial puritanism or purposeful absence, there is an extreme void in the fiction of Neal Stephenson and William Gibson when it comes to either man-to-man or woman-to-woman love. Gibson skirts around the issue by being farely prudish about sex in general. In Neuromancer, the one encounter between Molly and Case is empty, and lacks any substantial repercussions on either character. Sex is like cyberspace, plug-in and plug-out, only cyberspace is the much more enjoyable of the two activities.  Snow Crash treats sexuality as virtually unchanged from today (with a few technological enhancements, such as the dentata). A natural sexual tension between YT and Hiro builds up through the novel, and much of the plot revolves around Hiro&#039;s desire to reinstate himself with Juanita, and YT&#039;s fling with Raven. Despite the prominence of the sexual side of human interaction, there are few to no references to homosexuality whatsoever in his novel. Where are they? Identity politics definitely exist (look at the apartheid burb-claves), yet no gay identity.  Stephenson&#039;s vision, where commercialized or self-designed avatars act as go-betweens for human interaction on the Street, both point to a redefinition of identity by the sudden lack of physical context to human interaction. In a sympathetic or even passive reading of Gibson or Stephenson, this redefinition implies an abandonment of sexual politics as a viable means of forming community. Considering the embracing of the Internet and WWW by the gay community, the absence of homosexuality in these futurist settings is problematic.  Well, I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response 6 - Women.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/207</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the use of the female pronoun for everyone except the person to whom you are attracted is an effective way of referring to people. It may be ambiguous in some situations, but I think that it sufficiently describes the actual interaction between gender and sexuality, in a way that more concrete terminology does not. Why should our language enforce an emphasis on physical sex when describing attraction? There are numerous other ways to accomplish this, as well as other ways to remove the physical gender of the speaker from direct emphasis, but I think that the method in &quot;Stars&quot; is quite a bit more effective. In other methods, it is necessary to retain the language of gender to refer to a particular individual, usually as the gender to which they had not been traditionally assigned, and similarly to refer to the people to whom they are attracted. The &quot;Stars&quot; method allows the separation between gender and physical sex to be entirely complete. The assignation of gender to an individual is no longer arbitrary, or socially constructed.&lt;br /&gt;
An excellent example of the efficiency of this method in sexual situations comes when Marq interacts with Clym, the assassin. Marq begins interacting with Clym more &quot;out of boredom than real lust,&quot; but after they have had sex, during most of their conversation, Marq refers to Clym as &quot;him,&quot; indicating some level of attraction (89). It is only after Clym describes torturing Marq for pleasure that Clym is &quot;she,&quot; because Marq is clearly too frightened to be attracted (97). It is a very clear distinction, for Marq, and it is conveyed in a precise manner.&lt;br /&gt;
This clarity, at least for me, was only really come by after the fact, however. To someone familiar only with our current language, it is difficult not to wonder to what physical sex each &quot;woman&quot; in the book belongs. It was confusing for quite a while, and until I got used to it, it made things quite confusing. I think this is really only a product of the culture and language in which I experienced the book. I don&#039;t think the method in concept would be confusing to those who were using it. I think that a reference to gender in a pervasive context in language is fundamentally unnecessary. The &quot;Stars&quot; method maintains words for physical sex (Male and Female), and uses them when clarification is necessary. In most common speech, however, it is not necessary to know the physical sex of the person speaking.&lt;br /&gt;
I would not make the argument that the method would work in our culture, by any means. As it stands now, there is far too much emphasis placed culturally on gender to allow its complete removal from the language. We cannot simply begin referring to everyone else as &quot;women&quot; without some serious misinterpretation and misunderstanding. That is not, however, a normative argument. I think that a better culture would have no need to refer to gender so pervasively.&lt;br /&gt;
And that, I think, is what most impresses me about Delany&#039;s construction. It may provide some misunderstanding to those unfamiliar with it, but the re-organization that he has created has a specific, clear purpose, and is applied consistently enough to provide an entirely new perspective on interpersonal interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
But why choose &quot;him&quot; as the object of sexual attraction, and &quot;her&quot; as the neutral pronoun? I think that, superficially, the decision had a lot to do with Delany&#039;s own sexuality. I think there&#039;s more to it, though. Choosing &quot;woman&quot; as the standard, professional reference flies in the face of typical interaction in our culture. If everyone had been referred to as &quot;him&quot; in Delany&#039;s book, it would seem natural to think of everyone as male (as it was in &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot;), whereas referring to everyone as &quot;her&quot; made me, at least, unable to come to any immediate conclusions about each character&#039;s gender in my mind. Again, I don&#039;t think Delany does not do anything with language without some purpose in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>sexuality &amp; power dynamic in lilith&#039;s brood</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/162</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, I really enjoyed reading this book; in my opinion it does a far better job of presenting an alternative view of gender than Left Hand of Darkness did. I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d necessarily want our civilization to evolve in this direction gender-wise, but clearly Oankali society functions quite smoothly even with a lack of duality. The message is that this kind of functioning is possible for us. Lilith&#039;s Brood is a feminist work in the best sense because it promotes and presents a model of true gender equality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, the ooloi or &quot;third&quot; gender, who are both male and female integrated, seem to wield most of the power and influence in Oankali society, They take the primary role in procreation and are respected as &quot;treasured strangers&quot; (pp.106). The female Oankali follow just behind them in status, and the males are actually the calmest and most passive. Ultimately, however, an Oankali&#039;s gender is of little consequence; though ooloi, those of the gender that would be most unfamiliar to humans, are the ones specifically bred to work with humans.&lt;br /&gt;
The structure of Oankali society forces the reader (and the human characters) to confront and accept functional androgyny, and possibly even respect it. It is interesting that even with this degree of control and extra ability, ooloi are still called &quot;outsiders&quot;; perhaps to gradually get the reader audience used to such an idea? I&#039;m not certain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved how among the Oankali, sex is not demonized, it is embraced, and yet made very scientific at the same time. Sex is &quot;shared&quot; rather than being &quot;had&quot;. Possession has nothing to do with it; the experience is either sensual and about pleasure, or neutral and merely biological. The process of maturing sexually has an almost-sacred significance and is referred to as a &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. Oankali do not have a separate set of sexual organs; sensory arms are &quot;very flexible, very versatile, but only another limb&quot; (pp.110). Oankali do not struggle with sexuality and obsess over pleasure to the same degree that humans do, and yet, it is what they live for in a way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only part of the gender model in this book that maybe doesn&#039;t work so well is the &quot;demonizing&quot; of the human male. I&#039;m sure that most human men probably would go a little bonkers after not having sex for months, but I doubt that it would drive them all to violence and total dehumanization of women in their minds. In other words, Paul Titus bothers me. It&#039;s interesting that the Oankali treated two humans the way that we treat animals today; put &#039;em in a cage and wait until they mate. However, what do animals do if they don&#039;t want to mate? They just don&#039;t! No killing or injury involved. I think that human men are being deliberately portrayed as &quot;out of control&quot; but it&#039;s an unfair generalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a conversation between Lilith and Tate Marah, the first woman that she Awakens, where many interesting things show up:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Who are you Awakening?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Leah Bede and Celene Iver.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Two more women? Why don&#039;t you wake up a man?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I will eventually.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;You&#039;re still thinking about your Paul Titus, aren&#039;t you?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;He wasn&#039;t mine.&quot; She wished that she had not told Tate about him.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Awaken a man next, Lilith. The guy who was found protecting the kids.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;On the theory that if you fall off a horse, you should immediately get back on?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Tate, once he&#039;s Awake, he stays Awake. He&#039;s used to ordering people around. He can&#039;t save us or protect us but he can damn sure screw us up.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;So what, you&#039;re going to wait until you can Awaken him to a kind of harem?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Tate seems to be driven by typical female desires: the wish to be protected, and sexual desire. Lilith is thinking of the whole group and who will be the most useful, not worrying about her own ability to function sexually. However, they are almost turning some tables and treating the man in question like an object, an animal who would be unable to control himself simply because he is outnumbered by women. This is an interesting experiment to look at, but it is basically reverse-sexist, and probably wouldn&#039;t work so well in our human society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>this was meant to be a respone...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;...This was meant to be a response to the long thread of comments on the entry titled, &quot;The extension of human masculinity,&quot; but it became this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to watch people get so riled up about gender in class.  I understand that some people believe it&#039;s a social construct and that stereotypes are evil, etc. etc., but I think that this belief in gender and the stereotypes attached to each one is so deeply ingrained, that there&#039;s no point in arguing aimlessly about it.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m maybe not going to make any sense when I try to explain this, but I&#039;m going to try... So in my Lit Theory class today (or yesterday, technically speaking), we were discussing Nietsche&#039;s and Frost&#039;s ideas on metaphors.  Metaphors are so common in our everyday language that we don&#039;t even notice them anymore (ie. &quot;She&#039;s a warm person.&quot;  Life as a journey can be extended to the statement &quot;I&#039;m lost.&quot;).  Ultimately, metaphors stabilize and give meaning to our perceptions by helping us understand things in relation to other ones.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Left Hand of Darkness and Lilith&#039;s Brood, the metaphors are the references to gender that the authors make.  Here&#039;s one to refresh your memory: &quot;Estraven&#039;s performance had been womanly, all charm and tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit&quot;(LeGuin 12)&lt;br /&gt;
While I do not doubt that authors like Butler and LeGuin may be trying to provoke us with these gendered non-gender beings, maybe they&#039;re also just providing supposedly male, or supposedly female attributes, so that WE, as readers, can engage in and better understand (and maybe even empathize with?) these aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as power for the ooloi</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(This started out as a reply to two separate posts, but got rather long and wandered off a bit on its own argument, so I&#039;m posting it independently, but referencing the posts that inspired parts of it where applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to CZ and his assertion that the Oankali are definitely alien in &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/152&quot;&gt;his comment to roseblack&#039;s post&lt;/a&gt; --I&#039;m not going to argue that there is a direct correlation between every aspect of the Oankali and humans.  Lacking my own tentacled ooloi, I&#039;d be a bit hard pressed.  I will, however, argue that there are many parallels to be drawn between them and us, particularly pertaining to gender.  That is, if I can be trusted to not be apparently inherently manipulative self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151&quot;&gt;As CZ stated in own blog&lt;/A&gt;, the Oankali are not in the moral right they wish to see themselves inhabiting (a self-delusion to which humans themselves are prone).  Taking the argument one step further, they themselves are a hierarchical society, both internally with the submission of the males and females to the ooloi, and in the way they treat humans, who they claim they want as partners in an *equal* trade, instead treating the humans as pets, as Lilith herself explicitly notes when Nikanj first shows her off to the other Oankali its age (54).  One would be hard pressed to argue that the Oankali do not treat the humans as lesser beings than themselves.  There&#039;s a clear power dynamic present, in favor of the Oankali.  Power dynamic implies hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this seemingly inter-species conflict translate to gender?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, it doesn&#039;t.  There is a whole lot being said about race here.  The different races of the humans are mentioned, but not dwelt on because there is such a huge gap between human and oankali.  But there are clear parallels to gender within the power dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, though, I would like to point out that Butler was born in America (right here in LA, actually), and lived here during her life, and she specifically sees her work as commenting on the Western construct of race, and implied, greater Western societal situation.  I will point you in &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.sfwa.org/members/butler/&quot;&gt;this direction&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point into her biography and what she has to say about her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roseblack brought up the idea that, while less graphic and traditionally violent than our society&#039;s concept of rape, or the flat-out rape attempts portrayed in the book, Nikanj rapes Lilith when it impregnates her in a comment replying to Count Zero&#039;s comment to the original roseblack post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some etymology.  In Middle English, rape meant to do something hurriedly.  By the fifteenth century, though, the word took on the meaning &quot;The act of taking anything by force; violent seizure (of goods), robbery&quot; (noun) and &quot;To rob, strip, plunder (a place). Also used with a group of people as object&quot; (verb) (OED online).   Fundamentally, rape isn&#039;t about sex.  It&#039;s about exerting power over another individual against the other person&#039;s will, power over that person&#039;s body, somehow objectifying that person, and doing this through a means that, nowadays, involves sexual organs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the book.  Regardless of how many different individuals&#039; genetic material Nikanj manipulated and melded and modified to impregnate Lilith with some &quot;perfect&quot; embryo, it is Nikanj who decides that Lilith should be impregnated, without her knowledge or consent, taking control of her own body away from her for its own purposes.  Additionally, this happens just after the humans have realized that, without their knowledge or informed consent, the ooloi have taken away the humans&#039; ability to have any physical contact with one another without extreme discomfort and revulsion.  Additionally, they have rendered the humans sterile without their consent.  The ooloi have manipulated the humans so that the ooloi have complete and utter control over the bodies of the human, control over the humans as objects, and they manipulate the objects sexually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lilith fends off the attempted rape of Allison, she says &quot;There&#039;ll be no rape here...Nobody here is property.  Nobody has the right to the use of anybody else&#039;s body...We stay human.  We treat each other like people, and we get through this like people&quot; (178).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oankali, especially the ooloi, do not abide by this.  The rhetoric of Nikanj made my skin crawl.  It says to Lilith, when discussing the problems that occurred by bonding with the humans before they were sent to the proto-forest, &quot;&#039;But most of us couldn&#039;t wait&#039;...It wrapped a sensory arm around her neck loosely.  &#039;It might have been better for both our peoples if we were not so strongly drawn to you&#039;&quot; (202).  Nikanj is placing the blame for fucking up the humans ON the humans because the humans were just too damned attractive to the Oankali for their own good.  Were the humans all running around in short skirts, asking for it, too?  The Oankali see themselves as indisputable superior to the humans (again, in creeps hierarchy), and thus somehow, the failings of the Oankali are not entirely their own fault.  Later, when Joseph is killed, it&#039;s because the oankali underestimated humans.  There&#039;s an implication that humans, without anyone to moderate them, and too impulsive, violent, and weak-willed for their own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the second time Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj have sex, Joseph says &quot;No!...You said I could choose.  I&#039;ve made my choice!&quot; to which Nikanj replies &quot;&#039;You have, yes.&#039;  It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment from him.  When he would have backed away, it held him.  It managed to lie down on the bed with him without seeming to force him down.  &#039;You see.  Your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (189).  Um, rape much?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#039;s not something inherently male or female, either on the victim or victimizer&#039;s side of the equation.  In our own society, yes, there&#039;s a tendency for certain genders to act against others, but it&#039;s not a rule, and there are certainly cases of women raping men, men raping men, women raping women, transgendered people raping and being raped by other transgenders, men, and women.  It&#039;s not something inherent to any specific gender.  Certain types/pairings get more coverage and/or happen with more frequency, based on population size, societal expectations that people live down to, the comfort in acknowledging what happened as rape.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the ooloi male in this instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When push comes to shove, however much we want to skirt around it, when it comes to humans, you&#039;re sterile, you have functional sperm, or you have functional eggs and a functional womb.  As far as the propagation of the species goes, this is it.  While the oankali have their own system of procreation, when they interbreed with the humans, they adopt and must work with certain aspects of human procreative anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the ooloi be seen as a neutered medical professional?  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of a movement to brand fertility specialists as rapists, or inherently male.  The oankali assert throughout the text that they use organic matter the way we use machines.  So why aren&#039;t the ooloi just cold, clinical medical professionals, using internal labs, probes, and turkey basters instead of synthetic ones?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s because they do not give their patients/hosts/victims a choice in the matter.  And, ultimately, in taking the genetic material, blending it, and then placing it in the womb, the ooloi are serving a function that, while more complex than traditional male fertilization in humans, achieves the same end.  Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child.  Without the presence of sperm, the gumball&#039;s just going to roll right out the machine at the end of a woman&#039;s menstrual cycle.  Is the maleness of the ooloi increased by the sensory arms?  Yes.  The imagery is certainly there to be interpreted as phallic at will.  But we don&#039;t know exactly *how* the embryo is inserted.  It&#039;s after Joseph&#039;s death, so not during sex.  The implication is that Nikanj implanted it sometime after Lilith had healed it and was herself recovering.  Again, kinda sketchy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that, because it creates the embryo, the ooloi is actually functioning more as a female.  Really long fallopian tubes, maybe.  It just doesn&#039;t ring true for me.  I think what really drove the masculinity of the ooloi in procreation home for me was, on page 246, when Nikanj tells Lilith she&#039;s pregnant--&quot;I have made you pregnant with Joseph&#039;s child.  I wouldn&#039;t have done it so soon, but I wanted to use his seed, not a printâ€¦And there&#039;s a limit to how long I can keep sperm alive.&quot;  This passage struck me far more as Nikanj being a conduit for the passage of sperm, taking the place of Joseph (male) because Joseph and Lilith were no longer able to touch one another.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, CZ said, in response to roseblack, &quot;It actually designs the genetic code for its offspring, and as an afterthought returns that design to the female&#039;s body.&quot;  The fact that, even though it has the genetic code, it CANNOT go through gestation, sets it up as male, compared to our base of knowledge and underlying biases going into the book.  It&#039;s not so much an afterthought as an apparent inability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&quot;You&#039;re going to have a baby and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; (roseblack)&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Now that is a far better point, but less directly male. The Ooloi do serve the role of determining birth time (as men did before the advent of birth control in more developed countries, and still do in less developed ones) but it is a subtle, finely tuned, and ultimately stronger dominance than simple penetration.&#039;(CZ)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#039;re arguing that the ooloi are hyper-male, super-male?  Unless there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing.  And while, yes, birth control can prevent birth, on the flip side, some aspect of a man is still necessary to *create* a baby if a woman so desires, so it really is rather impossible to completely remove one gender or the other from procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, not to be discounted, there IS a history of patriarchy in our society, like it or not.  On some respects, the ooloi are neutering the men and turning themselves into hyper-men when it comes to the process of procreation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the second book, it becomes explicitly clear that the ooloi have rendered the &quot;pure&quot; humans sterile to force assimilation with the oankali, or die out as a race.  They say, though, that they have given humans a choice.  It&#039;s not much of a choice, though.  And it completely disempowers humans as individuals, taking away their ability to create their own future.  This has both racial and gendered overtones to it, but seemed worth bringing up at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the ooloi always male?  No.  Compared to how humans are portrayed in the book, all of the oankali have impressively fluid personalities, independent of gender.  I was actually rather struck by how abnormally black and white the treatment human gender was, comparatively.  Perhaps it&#039;s more that there ARE gender distinctions among the humans, whereas they oankali are portrayed as more of an overall group, perhaps because they are the Other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, in the particular instance that roseblack initially spoke of, directly regarding the ooloi&#039;s role in reproduction, the ooloi is given a role of dominance over every other type of creature in its society and human society.  In this specific act, the ooloi is treated as male, when seen through the filter of our own society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Y - The Last Man</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&#039;s a comic book series called &quot;Y - The Last Man&quot; that&#039;s actually pretty related to the topics we&#039;ve been discussing lately. But unlike Left Hand of Darkness, which shows us a world where the two sexes as we know them have been sort of combined, this series shows us a world where one sex just ceases to exist. &lt;!--break--&gt;The story is about an English major named Yorick, and his pet monkey Ampersand, who are (apparently) the last remaining male mammals on planet earth after a catastrophe instantaneously wipes out all the others. Here&#039;s the description from the back of the first chapter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 4em&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Unmanned World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/2469/ythelastman00132ii4.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid #888888&quot;/&gt;In the summer of 2002, a plague of unknown origin destroyed every last sperm, fetus, and fully developed mammal with a Y chromosome (with the apparent exception of one young man and his male pet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;gendercide&quot; instantaneously exterminated 48% of the global population, or approximately 29 billion men. 495 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are now dead, as are 99% of the world&#039;s landowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States alone, more than 95% of all commercial pilots, truck drivers, and ship captains died... as did 92% of violent felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationally, 99% of all mechanics, electricians, and construction workers are now deceased... though 51% of the world&#039;s &lt;em&gt;agricultural&lt;/em&gt; labor force is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14 nations, including Spain and Germany, have women soldiers who have served in ground combat units. &lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt; of the United States&#039; nearly 200,000 female troops have ever participated in ground combat. Australia, Norway, and Sweden are the only countries with women serving on board submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Israel, all women between the ages of 18 and 26 have performed compulsory military service in the IDF for at least one year and nine months. Before the Plague, at least three Palestinian suicide bombers had been women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, 85% of all government representatives are now dead... as are 100% of Catholic priests, Muslim imams, and Orthodox Jewish rabbis.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&#039;m not sure if the &quot;29 billion men&quot; statistic is meant to be 2.9 or if it&#039;s referring to the male mammals also exterminated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series presents a pretty interesting view of what would happen. There&#039;s a fair amount of comic-book-ized material, like the badass secret agent who helps protect Yorick, and lots of somewhat cheesey, somewhat witty dialogue... but it&#039;s good. Some interesting phenomena that pop up: the &quot;Amazons&quot;, a cult whose philosophy is that men were punished and that the world is better off; Congress faces issues putting itself back together, because the remaining members are overwhelmingly Democrats, which the remaining ones see as unfair. Oh yeah, and there&#039;s less sex than you&#039;d think, because as it turns out, Yorick is trying to find his fiancÃ©, who was studying abroad in Australia when the Plague hit - unfortunately, it&#039;s not easy for anyone to find a boat or an airplane after the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Being Other in the Other&#039;s eyes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/140</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a fascinating interplay between light and dark, and the role of shadows in &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness.&quot;  Perhaps most interesting is the concept of shifgrethor, a code of honor amongst the Karhidians, which &quot;comes from an old word for shadow&quot; (247).    There is also, among the Handdarata, a focus on the &quot;un&quot;--that which seems to be the opposite of what is.  In many respects, the Karhidians seem to be defined more by what they are not, by what is unseen, and by what traditionally is thought to obscure.  It is a society that thrives through the unknown, through the unspoken (&quot;Secrecy in Karhide is to an extraordinary extent a matter of discretion, of an agreed, understood silence--an omission of questions, yet not an omission of answers&quot; (287.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is just human nature, perhaps it is a result of the weather, perhaps it is a result of a society of kemmering, not static sex assignments.  Whatever the underlying reasons are, though, this shadow life is something that the primary narrator, Genly Ai, does not understand for the bulk of the story, and which separates him from the others around him.  Likewise, this keeps others from truly understanding or questioning him.  It is not until Genly and Estraven have been a long while on the Ice that this cold wall between them begins to break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the text, the reader is presented with Genly&#039;s arguably problematic gendered perceptions of the world around him, ascribing his own frame of reference to a people that defies and in many ways destroys that frame of reference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is also something deeply unsettling about Genly for the inhabitants of Winter.  There is King Argaven&#039;s political fear and distrust of Genly&#039;s differences (34-40), and likewise his physical differences are noted by other characters over the course of his story.  It is not until Estraven and Genly have escaped to the Ice, though, and a friendship based on sheer mutual survival begins to develop, that we get any insight into how Genly is perceived, not as The Alien Envoy, but as an individual who is different.  Estraven&#039;s comments on gender at this juncture are perhaps the most interesting in the entire novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven&#039;s comments on Genly fall into two categories: the physical and the spirit, as it pertains to the body.  When Estraven himself is in kemmer, he reflects on Genly, musing &quot;A strange lowgrade sort of desire it must be, to be spread out over every day of the year, and never to know the choice of sex&quot; (232).    This sentiment seems to get to the heart of the conflict between the two depictions of sex and gender.  Estraven, when speaking of &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; means choosing male or female, not being arbitrarily assigned to one for all of life.  This flux between physical states of being seems to hearken back to the predominance of shadows in the Karhidian culture.  The flux between being sexed and androgynous also bears with it a very strong cycle of emotion, with the intensity of sexuality while in kemmer, and the utter lack of a sex drive when not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet reading the phrase &quot;the choice of sex,&quot; as one Genly&#039;s breed of humanity, I first read it as &quot;the choice to have sex, or not have sex.&quot;  Were the phrase uttered by Genly instead of Estraven, this would be a valid interpretation, as the Gethenians are as captive to their expression of sexuality by time as we are by sex assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estraven also ties Genly&#039;s sex to his physical and spiritual (not religious, but of the spirit) abilities.  He says &quot;There is a frailty about him.  He is all unprotected, exposed, vulnerable, even to his sexual organ which he must carry always outside himself; but he is strong, unbelievably strong.  I am not sure he can keep hauling any longer than I, but he can haul harder and faster than Iâ€¦To match his frailty and strength, he has a spirit easy to despair and quick to defiance; a fierce impatient courage&quot; (227-8).  Given Genly Ai&#039;s fairly constant comment on the slowness of life, evolution, and time on Winter, Estraven&#039;s understanding of Genly is particularly profound.  He has seen in an example of one what that one could not understand in an entire world.  Yet even this understanding of Genly&#039;s spirit is seen through the filter of the Gethenians.  Where Estraven sees frailty and physical vulnerability, our society has placed virility and strength.  Even when there is a deep personal connection between individuals, they are both still coming to one another from such different perspectives as to never be able to truly understand one another.  Though Genly spends much of the end of the book speaking of the universal human spirit, of &quot;serving Mankind&quot; (293), not just one nation or race, there are still deep differences between the races.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most telling indicator of the split between the Gethenians and Genly is that Estraven, in his times of deep emotion, of mind-connection, and in death, returns Genly&#039;s love for him by displacing his brother, Arek, onto Genry Ai, particularly in the mind-connection, where it is impossible to tell lies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might paint an initially bleak picture of the hope for understanding between Peoples at first glance, in between the arguments, running as a thread throughout, is the desire and hope for understanding.  Though this understanding might be doomed to be imperfect, on both sides, there is the effort, and the emotions created are very real.  We may never be able to walk in the Other&#039;s shoes, but there is the hope of walking along side him, and recognizing that he too must wear shoes, different though they may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The feminism of Genly Ai</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/139</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While my experience with this may not be universal, I found myself somewhat alienated by Genly Ai&#039;s perspective on the events he related.  I was much more drawn in to the narrative on those occasions when it was related by Estraven.  The factor that drew me out of Genly Ai&#039;s perspective was consistently his insistence on applying his particular conceptions of gender to the Gethenians he encountered.  Estraven, unfettered by the need to place his world into inapplicable terms, is better able to focus in on the more flowing parts of hte story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem, for me, of his mental gendering (beyond the much discussed pronoun) was the rather disturbing set of qualities he seemed to apply to the female gender.  It wasn&#039;t that his notion of masculinity wasn&#039;t disturbing, however, most of the time, when he attempted to explain or describe characteristics, it was in terms of his image of the feminine, which of course makes sense, as what he needs to relate and explain is the unfamiliar.  The easiest example is that he &quot;â€¦thought of him as [his] landlady, for he had fat buttocks that wagged as he walked, and a soft fat face, and a prying, spying, ignoble, kindly nature.&quot; (48)  He also conflates femininity with a flabby sort of softness in his descriptions of the Orgota.  Aside from that commonality, what he tends to interpret as feminine varies drastically, except that it always seems to pertain to relatively negative characteristics.  The &quot;landlady&#039;s&quot; geniality is cancelled out by his volubility, and his tendency to show of Mr. Ai&#039;s room to tourists.  He states (235) that women aren&#039;t mentally subnormal, but without conviction, as though he can&#039;t quite find another way to explain his society. It seems that the Envoy, and by extension, the Ekumen which he represents, isn&#039;t so advanced as one might expect of this egalitarian, Federation-like entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, is the purpose of this alienation?  Certainly, there&#039;s value in the alien narrator, as he takes us along in his explorations without the vehicle world-exploration appearing forced.  More importantly, however, he makes our judgments for us.  Genly Ai is a human like us, and while it&#039;s comforting to think that we would be better able to take the people of an unfamiliar society (different sexually, racially, culturally as well) on their own, appropriate terms, most people probably couldn&#039;t.  Thus, the perspective we find ourselves critiquing and drawing away from is a representation of our own.  While our critiques on the application of gender-roles to un-gendered individuals seems unconnected to our world, LeGuin is showing us a situation in which the human need to group doesn&#039;t just fail to be useful, but interferes with the ability of the thinker to do his job.  In saddling us into the head of another human, LeGuin asks us to take the message back a step further, to examine how our applications of gender roles and ideas may be hindering us now, in ways that an alien would immediately see.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So much to think about when ur stuck in the ice...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/138</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m still interested in what happens in this novel in terms of race, and the representation of racial issues in the future.  We might of tried to touch on it in class, but the overwhelming struggle over the meaning and the philosophy of gender in society was definitely something that took over.  It clearly has for almost all readers of the novel, down to the feminist writers who proclaimed that Le Guin&#039;s use of the male pronoun was the number one most anti-feminist act of all time.  I&#039;m not sure how many people shared my first impression, that race is something of a stagnant, bypassed, non-issue; but as we&#039;ve seen from Starship Troopers, race can be expected to take on a number of different appearances and undergo a number of different transformations in its manifestation in any brave new sci-fi world.  So I was/am suspicious that more is going on here in terms of racial politics than meets the eye.  I&#039;m of the opinion that talking about gender separately from race is inherently problematic, since all aspects of identity (but I would say these two in particular) are inextricable from one another.  They all intersect.&lt;br /&gt;
	Since one of the things that third-wave feminist literature (of member of which group this novel is ostensibly a part, according to its retrospective classification by people other than Le Guin) is reacting to is the failing of second-wave feminist literature to extend a critique of gender to other social structures, I tend to presume a consciousness in the work of the ways in which gender cannot stand alone from an issue like race.  But where do we see this in the work?&lt;br /&gt;
	On the one hand we certainly have some of the Star Trek &quot;federation&quot; model of race-overcome in Le Guin&#039;s universe, at least in the abstract and far-off body of the Ekumen.  Genly&#039;s elegant turn of phrase is not unfamiliar: &quot;we come all colors&quot; (39).  Genly himself is (to me) a typical Le Guin protagonist in that he is revealed to be dark-skinned, presumably of African descent, several pages into the novel.  Surprise, he&#039;s not Caucasian!  I think one of the passing comments in class was very accurate: Le Guin does do a certain recognizable amount of messing with what she knows are going to be the reader&#039;s assumptions, and revealing them to the reader in such a way as to make us unable to deny the systems that inform our reading of any text.  It&#039;s interesting to me here that Genly&#039;s race is one of the &quot;unsettling revelations&quot; she chooses to make, in a style similar to that in which it was casually dropped in that &quot;...even in a *bisexual society* the politician is very often something less than an integral man...&quot; (20).&lt;br /&gt;
	On the other hand, we still have what seem to be remnants of bizarre racial stereotyping worked into the novel, though in some cases I think I&#039;m willing to put it down to less-than-conscious decisions by the author.  I&#039;m not the only person to notice the Gethenian specific inability to differentiate between the &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds, or the Chinese-imperialist-style royal city-within-a-city (as evidenced in various places on the blog so far).  Bizarre referencing of &quot;oriental&quot; stereotypes, it feels like.  These are only a few instances of several when I felt a correlation between a familiar stereotype and Le Guin&#039;s fleshing out of the people of Winter in detail.  There&#039;s also the King&#039;s fascination with not only Genly&#039;s &quot;sexual perversion&quot; but his skin color, which is a troubling icon of difference to the King, alongside Genly&#039;s maleness.&lt;br /&gt;
	It&#039;s also important, I think, to keep in mind the *literal* presence and intersection of race and gender here.  To Genly Ai and the world he represents, the people of Winter are literally a different *race* of human.  The manifested differences in gender and sex, as well as various other less-novel physical traits of the Gethenians are in this way categorized as *race* differences. It&#039;s just an interesting thing to try and pick apart, since the Ekumen feels in many ways like a believable future for humanity.  Race isn&#039;t actually easy to define now, and I could easily see it undergoing a transformation of meaning and definition faced with a new and changing universe.&lt;br /&gt;
	On a slightly different note, I enjoyed the book immensely, especially since its purpose seemed to be to disrupt the reader.  I think I love this book simply as an exercise in breaking down societal givens, rather than a treatise on the inherent nature of man (human) or an attempt to solidify any one problem with modern society by reflecting it in dystopia or utopia.  It&#039;s open-ended, and though we see through Genly Ai&#039;s eyes, it is much easier to experience the world with a sense of wonder and perhaps discomfort that feel much easier to separate from the protagonist&#039;s own rationalization of the world than say, The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, in which we cannot seem to escape Offred&#039;s head and social isolation.  Interesting, since both main characters narrate their own stories precisely as stories, and both tales are conceived of as direct reports which stand as evidence for a past, unreachable experience.  I can&#039;t seem to grasp at why that is, except perhaps that the literal unseating of a gender (or sex?) dichotomy is the more novel to us, the more confrontational and the newest frontier to the reader themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Why Women Aren&#039;t Funny.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/118</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Linked through the Slog, I found this. I went in expecting to be quite offended, and was surprised by the wit with which Mr. Hitchens went through his argument. Does it being funny make it any less offensive? Does he have a point? Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Gethenians and Bugs</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I had been pondering in class, but didn&#039;t really get around to talking about was a comparison between the Bugs of Starship Troopers and the Gethenians.  I was considering how we responded very differently, as did the protagonists, to the bugs and the Gethenians and what some of the factors are that go into that.  In class we were describing the Gethenians as so very different from us, but at the same time, according to Le Guin&#039;s constructed biological family tree both the people of Terran and the people of Gethen were descended from the same people of Hain, and Genly can &quot;pass&quot; as being a native of the planet, if a slightly strange one.  (That also brings up the idea of &quot;passing,&quot; which is an incredibly loaded discussion both in considering race and gender/sexuality, but I don&#039;t have the stamina or inclination to go there right now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bugs had a similarly binary sexuality, even though separated by caste, so there were the drones and warriors - who we assume are male - and then the queen, obviously female.  Perhaps it is that the Bugs were so much like insects that we barely compared them to ourselves, but it struck me as strange that we mentioned how different the Gethenians were when Estraven states that from a visible standpoint, and even in some cultural aspects, they&#039;re extremely similar, it&#039;s the inner biology that so very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if this makes sense to anyone else, but it stuck out as a thought during discussion today that we seemed more comfortable with the idea of an insect race of aliens with identifiable and stable genders that we can clearly categorize and compare to something familiar.  And we seemed highly uncomfortable with the idea of this fluctuating gender and the accompanying foreign changes that result from it in society, even though solely by physical appearance the Gethenians should have been so much more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d be happy to hear any thoughts, as mine aren&#039;t really formed into a single cohesive argument at all.  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>female objectification</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/100</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Atwood&#039;s The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is often described as a work of feminist literature there are no heroic, or even admirable female characters.  Instead, the cast of female characters serves as an inventory of all the ways a woman can fail in the context of oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
Serena Joy was an advocate for the return of &quot;family values,&quot; she campaigned for women to return to the domestic sphere.  If any woman should have wholeheartedly embraced the Republic of Gilead, it should have been her, but she is not happy.  Offred even wonders: &quot;Which of us is it worse for, her or me?&quot; (95). The only thing she seems to take pleasure in is abusing her power over the other women of the house.  She does have real power over them, particularly Offred, whom she can have sent to the colonies on a moment&#039;s notice.  She punishes Offred for stealing husband&#039;s attention even through the tiny practice of digging her rings into Offred&#039;s hands during the all-important &quot;ceremony.&quot;  Gilead causes makes her hypocritical and cruel.  Aunt Lydia did in fact wholeheartedly embrace the oppressive regime of the Republic of Gilead; she played an active part in its implementation and persistence as a matron of the reeducation centers. She goes beyond simply accepting the oppression, and actually adopts an oppressive role, and she relishes it: &quot;we, sitting in our rows, eyes down, we make her salivate morally.  We are hers to define&quot; (114).  Aunt Lydia is particularly repulsive in her active suppression of the &quot;right to&quot; for women, given that she herself is a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
Janine, a.k.a. Ofwarren, is similarly distasteful because of her apparent acceptance of her existence as a handmaid, even though this appearance is completely contrived.  Though in another context, we might forgive her behavior as a necessary evil for survival, here as readers it is incredibly difficult.  She supplicates herself at the feet of the regime.  She does so literally at the red center &quot;kneel[ing] at the front of the classroom, hands behind her backâ€¦ her red face and dripping nose&quot; and she admits, as to the cause of her rape at the age of 14 &quot;It was my own fault. I led them on. I deserved the pain&quot; (72).  Later, as a handmaid, she partakes in the bloodlust of the particicution.&lt;br /&gt;
Moira, at the beginning of the novel, is promising as a heroic female figure.  She escapes from the red center and becomes the handmaids&#039; &quot;fantasy&quot; (133).  Throughout her time at the Commander&#039;s house Offred fantasizes about the &quot;frisky&quot; Moira at large in the world, as a last remnant of the old world. We finally meet Moira again at Jezebels.  She is, in a certain sense, freer than Offred.  She can smoke, and drink, and have sex with women, she has face cream and drugs, she only works nights.  But she&#039;s not really free, she&#039;s a prostitute, but sells her body for only modest freedom.  She wasn&#039;t supposed to, as Offred says &quot;give in, go along, save her skin,&quot; we, like Offred want &quot;gallantry from her, swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; (249).  But even her spirit is broken.&lt;br /&gt;
The resistance of Ofwarren, our theoretical heroine, is potentially even more pathetic than that of the other women.  She&#039;s incredibly apathetic.  She spends more time making excuses than being angry.  She gives up resisting, to the point of being annoyed by Ofglen&#039;s plans for resistance, simply because of a small sexual outlet, in the form of Nick.  She, more than anyone else, has internalized her oppression.  This fact manifests itself in her descriptions of the world.  She illustrates the world around her in compulsive detail, her justification being that it keeps her mind from her oppression.  However, these descriptions show her obsession with the color red, it shows up more than any other color in her descriptions.  She describes the red of the blood-smile and the Serena Joy&#039;s tulips.  The smell of the flowers in the garden is red.  She comments on the dusk-rose velvet on the drapes in the commander&#039;s house and remembers the veiny redness of a leaf on the ground of the forest when she was captured.  For her, red is the color of her robe, representative of her definition as being functional purely on a biological level, representative of her adultery and shame.  That she should be so aware of it in her life shows how deeply she has internalized her shame.&lt;br /&gt;
Given that this novel is so often read as a work of feminist literature, clearly Atwood wasn&#039;t trying to show that women are weak or inferior to men.  Rather this pervasiveness of shame, and guilt, the fact that they all felt that they &quot;deserved it&quot; (177) goes to show just how debilitating subjugation can be.  An effective oppressive regime can cause even the freest of spirits to surrender if given a small chance for release within the system, whether that release is control over other women, uncertain sexual relief, or forbidden pleasures at a steep cost.  For this reason, the novel is just as humanist as it is feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Empathy for a Handmaid</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/93</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve said a lot already about some pretty powerful issues that can&#039;t be ignored in this book.  Here, I think I&#039;d like to talk about something that isn&#039;t perhaps as critical to understanding the novel&#039;s implications for our own real, modern world, at first glance or otherwise.  I&#039;m interested in how the novel deal with empathy; as a human characteristic, as a potentially gendered characteristic, its sentimentalization (or lack thereof), and the ways that these understandings of empathy might inform society, dystopic or otherwise.  To be clear, I really think this novel makes a point of *not* sentimentalizing empathy (or sympathy), and by doing so seems to imply that it may not be a natural (real? easy?) human instinct.  This is quite different form the way that so many narratives, Hollywood or otherwise, are formed, in which it is empathy that finally breaks through a villain&#039;s shell or that sets the hero apart from the rest and make him/her attractive to others.  The Handmaid&#039;s Tale the film is hugely different from the book in this respect I think, and therefore I&#039;m going to ignore it for now.&lt;br /&gt;
	One of the things we talked about in the last class on Monday (and is discussed extensive on this blog) was a particular scene at the end of chapter 28 (my page 236, probably not yours), one of many flashbacks, in which Offred is remembering Luke&#039;s reaction and attempt at comforting her when she ends the day without a job and with no property whatsoever to her name.  Some people are troubled by the depiction of Luke here, either as unfeeling and chauvinistic (he doesn&#039;t care enough about her problems to think twice about asking for sex), or as an unfair and emotionally warped depiction of him by an upset Offred.  Either of these interpretations seems to me potentially to make a comment on the gendered nature of empathy, depending on whether it is Luke or Offred who is incapable of understanding the feelings and motivations of the other.  I&#039;m more inclined to understand Luke in this scene as unable to understand, despite his intentions.  His actions read more to me like someone who wants to offer comfort, but is unsure how in the face of feeling he cannot comprehend.  Offred herself was just as complacent before that day when confronted with signs of the coming horrors, feeling that she was watching stories &quot;About other women, and the men who did such things were other men.  None of them were the men we knew. The newspaper stories were like dreams to us, bad dreams dreamt by others&quot; (74).  In fact, later in the novel Offred almost seems to be troubled by the universal ability to ignore and distance: in Gilead marketplace with Ofglen, Offred witnesses one of the few public disturbances in the novel, a scene in which a seeming innocent bystander is whisked away by the Eyes in a brutal maneuver.  Shortly thereafter the traffic resumes as though nothing had happened, and Offred notes that all she feels is relief that it wasn&#039;t her (220).&lt;br /&gt;
	I find that the most frightening characteristic of this novel is the isolation that every citizen of Gilead, and the isolation that we experience through Offred&#039;s eyes.  She constantly dwells on how she does not (and can not) know what her companion, be Ofglen, Serena Joy, The Commander, or Nick, is feeling.  One almost expects some relief of this emotional isolation to come of Offred&#039;s interactions with the Commander, since he seems to imply that understanding and complicity is what he seeks, and Offred is there because his wife and he &quot;Don&#039;t seem to have much in common, these days&quot; (203).  However, though Offred and the commander become more human to one-another, there is no genuine understanding of the mentality of the other. &quot;For him, I must remember, I am a whim.&quot; (205).  The most Offred can seem to say of any newfound understanding of or connection with the commander is that &quot;He is of interest to me, he occupies space, he is more than a shadow&quot; (210).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>beta male uprising</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/54</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just an entry in response to some of the comments made in class today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting that the new machismo in Neuromancer could be conveyed through &quot;non-badassness.&quot;  When we discussed ST last week, someone had brought up the fact that Johnny was feminized through his relationship with Flores (additionally, the movie version of Dizzy was also a very masculine female).  I thought that the relationship between Molly and Case was similar in the gender role reversal vein.  Molly is the brawn and Case is the brain (mind/body relationship?).  Furthermore, in conjunction with the Huntington article, Case is the atypical masculine hero in that &quot;Heroic and skillful action for Case takes place a the computer keyboard&quot; (137) rather than through sheer &quot;extraordinary athleticism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
