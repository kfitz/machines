 <title>Hello!</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to be up and running smoothly, sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m interested in some type of &#039;science fiction inventory&#039; -- an assessment of what a particular person is drawing on when they talk about the genre as they know it. Personally, my mother often bragged about watching Star Wars with me while I was in the womb and we had a fair amount of Star Trek (both OS and TNG). As I grew up, mobs of Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figures lived (and did battle) side by side in a miniature plywood house we made. My brother and I saved our allowance money for X-Men and Star Wars cards, again often playing games or setting up scenes in which to role-play them duking it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the actual literary side of science fiction played a much smaller role in determining these interests. We had a lot of Fantasy books for bedtime stories (Redwall, anyone?) and I loved &quot;I, Robot&quot; and the Star Wars Rogue Squadron sort of stuff, but I think it&#039;s fair to say that by the time I was a serious reader at all, I dismissed most sci-fi as fluff (&quot;Ender&#039;s Game&quot; was the closest I got to rediscovering the genre, but even that felt like a guilty pleasure by the time I was reading it late in high school). At the same time, we watched Voyager every week as a family (shameful, I know) and it was definitely more from movies/video games that I really learned about &#039;science fiction.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found such books exciting (I thought about Le Guin&#039;s &quot;the ones who walk away from Omelas&quot; for years after reading it in 6th grade and I loved &quot;Handmaid&#039;s Tale&quot; in high school), but didn&#039;t really read that much on my own. Maybe it was because I fell into the trap of not doing much reading for fun. Particularly because, when I did, it was the equivalent of educational baby-food -- Harry Potter and the like. In the reading of &quot;canonical&quot; fiction and other coursework, I somehow forgot that there could be *good* science fiction that was stimulating on more than a surface level (I just read &quot;Foundation&quot; finally over winter break and it was a major reason to want to take this course).&lt;/p&gt;
