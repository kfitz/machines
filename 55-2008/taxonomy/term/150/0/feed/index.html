 <title>Soviets in Orgoreyn</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/114</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is kind of in addition to my earlier post, but I was just wondering if anyone had drawn the connections between Orgoreyn and Soviet Russia.  Obviously, they&#039;re both cold. BUT, also, Orgoreyn has a secret police, and their media is controlled by the censorship of the mysterious Sarf.  In addition to these similarities, Orgoreyn is also  &quot;a genuine fullblown bureaucracy&quot; (Le Guin 144).  The descriptions of the work camp also sound disturbingly similar to those of the gulag: &quot;At Pulefen Farm we were...underfed for the work we did, and our clothing, particularly our footwear, was completely inadequate for that winter climate.  The guards, most of them probationary prisoners, were not much better off&quot; (Le Guin 178).  There are other similarities, but I thought that these were the most interesting.  Anyone else notice this? (or it might just be disturbingly obvious, and we&#039;ll probably talk about it in class :))&lt;/p&gt;
