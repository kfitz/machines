 <title>the parody of ethnicity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/264</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During the student led discussion on Monday the issue of Asian representation in Snow Crash was brought up.  The concern was voiced that depicting Asians as a single race was reverting back to when Westerners refused to differentiate between Asians. While in many attempts the book does reject stereotypes, there are still unyielding definitions of race.  While I wholly agree that these are legitimate observations, I feel that Stephenson made the subversive decision to not distinguish between any of the races.  There is a sense, certainly in the Metaverse, that people no longer feel the need to use their ethnicity as a primary method of identification.  In a world where money has lost its value and everyone is sovereign, geography and culture have become inconsequential.  Not surprisingly, this translates to a lack of human attachment to one&#039;s ethnic group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a technically advanced world as Metaverse, self-representation is constructed in a new and bizarre way.  The players may not be constrained by their race but their socioeconomic circumstances certainly play a factor.  Avatars are still recognized by their class within the economy.  People enter the virtual reality to escape their own reality but they cannot escape the fact that wealth equals power.  The Metaverse does not allow one&#039;s imaginations to run free; rather it reinforces the restraints of real life.  On that note, I found it interesting that often, the avatars did not attempt to lead their lives that differently than they did in the non-virtual world.  Also, was anyone else humored by the fact that one could make his penis as large as he so desired but could not be taller than he was in real life?  Very oddâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the issue of blending ethnicities, I was interested in what the Mafia symbolized.  Of course, it lived up to the traditional connotations of the Mafia with its emphasis being on the &quot;family&quot; and loyalty.  Snow Crash&#039;s Mafia, however, is not solely comprised of the stereotypical Italian gangsters.  On the contrary, this Mafia&#039;s family has Jamaicans, Mexicans and Asians.  Having nothing to do with blood, the Mafia is an organization of many races that still bases its principles on respect and of course, hierarchy.  Hiro Protagnoist exists within an array of ethnicities and cultures.  His first job in the novel is delivering pizzas for the Mafia.  He lives in Mr. Lee&#039;s Hong Kong and has a Russian roommate.  A underlying commonality between the characters is that they are not concerned with someone&#039;s ethnic background.  They are instead all driven by the Mafia attitude â€“ how will this person help me get what I want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I believe that, like the majority of the novel&#039;s themes, the representation of race is satirical.  How can one even place importance on ethnicity when the majority of time is spent in a virtual world where your persona is completely your own creation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Swordplay in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/260</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading Snow Crash, the most consistently jarring ( as in, taking me out of the story ) aspect was Hiro&#039;s swordplay. Though he&#039;s the greatest hacker in the world ( both real world and Metaverse ), he&#039;s equally proud of being the greatest swordsman. He carries his katanas everywhere, and uses them extensively-- not just in the Metaverse, but the real world. A modern-day samurai, with the emphasis on &quot; modern-day &quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s obviously a lot of entertainment inherent to the sword fights, and a lot of that is due to romanticizing the sword. Though rendered obsolete by the invention of guns, swords are arguably more attractive, take more skill to use, are more visceral in the way they dispatch foes. Anyone can point a gun and shoot ( hitting the target being more difficult ), but swordsmanship is a difficult skill, even an art. No wonder they remain popular in fiction, despite being much rarer in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties perfectly into Hiro&#039;s identity; one, in terms of a skill that he would want to practice ( he defines himself by mastering complex tasks, either hacking or swordplay ), two, in terms of ethnic identity ( the Japanese/Nipponese aspects of his background are symbolized in the way he carries his swords with him everywhere ), and three, just as an expression of maschismo. It&#039;s all well and good, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that this is not Fuedal Japan, this is a Cyberpunk future where firearms are everywhere.  I can get him using his swords in the virtual world, but in reality? Where he&#039;s surrounded by enemies with guns? Where sticking around to cut people up would logically make him a huge target and resultantly get him filled with lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&#039;s a lot of this &quot; Rule of Cool &quot; stuff in Snow Crash, things like rocketboards and supersonic cyborg attack dogs and what not, but this is particularly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
