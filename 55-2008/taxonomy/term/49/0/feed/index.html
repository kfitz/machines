 <title>The brain bug is bringing sexy back</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/41</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Did anyone else notice that the front of the brain bug looked like a big, mucousy vagina?  Which then leads to the exchange of bodily fluids, in its case brains rather than semen.  And as long as we&#039;re making gender commentaries, the brain bug only sucked the brains out of male characters: Carmen castrated it good with an arm that had only recently been IMPALED.  And since I&#039;m  here, why not take Xander handing Carmen the knife as a Freudian attraction to the vagina-faced bug, rather than some silly Hollywood chivalry.  Both of the guys we saw with sucked-out brains definitely had their O-face on.  I can try to tie this to some shred of credibility with theories about the hive-mind insect species we know on our own planet all being ruled by &quot;Queens&quot; that the brain-bug might represent, and talking about the sexualization of the brain, the  weird sexual tension between it and Carl, and the scientifically-airtight scene where they jam a wicked-looking probe into its face just to see what happens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone much smarter, older, and balder than myself told me that filmmakers make a conscious effort to sexualize any nightmarish creature we see in a movie because of the link between libido and fear.  I just want to know how I can win me a date with the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
