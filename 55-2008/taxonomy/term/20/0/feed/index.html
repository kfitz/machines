 <title>Sex as power for the ooloi</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(This started out as a reply to two separate posts, but got rather long and wandered off a bit on its own argument, so I&#039;m posting it independently, but referencing the posts that inspired parts of it where applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to CZ and his assertion that the Oankali are definitely alien in &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/152&quot;&gt;his comment to roseblack&#039;s post&lt;/a&gt; --I&#039;m not going to argue that there is a direct correlation between every aspect of the Oankali and humans.  Lacking my own tentacled ooloi, I&#039;d be a bit hard pressed.  I will, however, argue that there are many parallels to be drawn between them and us, particularly pertaining to gender.  That is, if I can be trusted to not be apparently inherently manipulative self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151&quot;&gt;As CZ stated in own blog&lt;/A&gt;, the Oankali are not in the moral right they wish to see themselves inhabiting (a self-delusion to which humans themselves are prone).  Taking the argument one step further, they themselves are a hierarchical society, both internally with the submission of the males and females to the ooloi, and in the way they treat humans, who they claim they want as partners in an *equal* trade, instead treating the humans as pets, as Lilith herself explicitly notes when Nikanj first shows her off to the other Oankali its age (54).  One would be hard pressed to argue that the Oankali do not treat the humans as lesser beings than themselves.  There&#039;s a clear power dynamic present, in favor of the Oankali.  Power dynamic implies hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this seemingly inter-species conflict translate to gender?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, it doesn&#039;t.  There is a whole lot being said about race here.  The different races of the humans are mentioned, but not dwelt on because there is such a huge gap between human and oankali.  But there are clear parallels to gender within the power dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, though, I would like to point out that Butler was born in America (right here in LA, actually), and lived here during her life, and she specifically sees her work as commenting on the Western construct of race, and implied, greater Western societal situation.  I will point you in &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.sfwa.org/members/butler/&quot;&gt;this direction&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point into her biography and what she has to say about her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roseblack brought up the idea that, while less graphic and traditionally violent than our society&#039;s concept of rape, or the flat-out rape attempts portrayed in the book, Nikanj rapes Lilith when it impregnates her in a comment replying to Count Zero&#039;s comment to the original roseblack post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some etymology.  In Middle English, rape meant to do something hurriedly.  By the fifteenth century, though, the word took on the meaning &quot;The act of taking anything by force; violent seizure (of goods), robbery&quot; (noun) and &quot;To rob, strip, plunder (a place). Also used with a group of people as object&quot; (verb) (OED online).   Fundamentally, rape isn&#039;t about sex.  It&#039;s about exerting power over another individual against the other person&#039;s will, power over that person&#039;s body, somehow objectifying that person, and doing this through a means that, nowadays, involves sexual organs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the book.  Regardless of how many different individuals&#039; genetic material Nikanj manipulated and melded and modified to impregnate Lilith with some &quot;perfect&quot; embryo, it is Nikanj who decides that Lilith should be impregnated, without her knowledge or consent, taking control of her own body away from her for its own purposes.  Additionally, this happens just after the humans have realized that, without their knowledge or informed consent, the ooloi have taken away the humans&#039; ability to have any physical contact with one another without extreme discomfort and revulsion.  Additionally, they have rendered the humans sterile without their consent.  The ooloi have manipulated the humans so that the ooloi have complete and utter control over the bodies of the human, control over the humans as objects, and they manipulate the objects sexually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lilith fends off the attempted rape of Allison, she says &quot;There&#039;ll be no rape here...Nobody here is property.  Nobody has the right to the use of anybody else&#039;s body...We stay human.  We treat each other like people, and we get through this like people&quot; (178).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oankali, especially the ooloi, do not abide by this.  The rhetoric of Nikanj made my skin crawl.  It says to Lilith, when discussing the problems that occurred by bonding with the humans before they were sent to the proto-forest, &quot;&#039;But most of us couldn&#039;t wait&#039;...It wrapped a sensory arm around her neck loosely.  &#039;It might have been better for both our peoples if we were not so strongly drawn to you&#039;&quot; (202).  Nikanj is placing the blame for fucking up the humans ON the humans because the humans were just too damned attractive to the Oankali for their own good.  Were the humans all running around in short skirts, asking for it, too?  The Oankali see themselves as indisputable superior to the humans (again, in creeps hierarchy), and thus somehow, the failings of the Oankali are not entirely their own fault.  Later, when Joseph is killed, it&#039;s because the oankali underestimated humans.  There&#039;s an implication that humans, without anyone to moderate them, and too impulsive, violent, and weak-willed for their own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the second time Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj have sex, Joseph says &quot;No!...You said I could choose.  I&#039;ve made my choice!&quot; to which Nikanj replies &quot;&#039;You have, yes.&#039;  It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment from him.  When he would have backed away, it held him.  It managed to lie down on the bed with him without seeming to force him down.  &#039;You see.  Your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (189).  Um, rape much?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#039;s not something inherently male or female, either on the victim or victimizer&#039;s side of the equation.  In our own society, yes, there&#039;s a tendency for certain genders to act against others, but it&#039;s not a rule, and there are certainly cases of women raping men, men raping men, women raping women, transgendered people raping and being raped by other transgenders, men, and women.  It&#039;s not something inherent to any specific gender.  Certain types/pairings get more coverage and/or happen with more frequency, based on population size, societal expectations that people live down to, the comfort in acknowledging what happened as rape.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the ooloi male in this instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When push comes to shove, however much we want to skirt around it, when it comes to humans, you&#039;re sterile, you have functional sperm, or you have functional eggs and a functional womb.  As far as the propagation of the species goes, this is it.  While the oankali have their own system of procreation, when they interbreed with the humans, they adopt and must work with certain aspects of human procreative anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the ooloi be seen as a neutered medical professional?  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of a movement to brand fertility specialists as rapists, or inherently male.  The oankali assert throughout the text that they use organic matter the way we use machines.  So why aren&#039;t the ooloi just cold, clinical medical professionals, using internal labs, probes, and turkey basters instead of synthetic ones?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s because they do not give their patients/hosts/victims a choice in the matter.  And, ultimately, in taking the genetic material, blending it, and then placing it in the womb, the ooloi are serving a function that, while more complex than traditional male fertilization in humans, achieves the same end.  Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child.  Without the presence of sperm, the gumball&#039;s just going to roll right out the machine at the end of a woman&#039;s menstrual cycle.  Is the maleness of the ooloi increased by the sensory arms?  Yes.  The imagery is certainly there to be interpreted as phallic at will.  But we don&#039;t know exactly *how* the embryo is inserted.  It&#039;s after Joseph&#039;s death, so not during sex.  The implication is that Nikanj implanted it sometime after Lilith had healed it and was herself recovering.  Again, kinda sketchy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that, because it creates the embryo, the ooloi is actually functioning more as a female.  Really long fallopian tubes, maybe.  It just doesn&#039;t ring true for me.  I think what really drove the masculinity of the ooloi in procreation home for me was, on page 246, when Nikanj tells Lilith she&#039;s pregnant--&quot;I have made you pregnant with Joseph&#039;s child.  I wouldn&#039;t have done it so soon, but I wanted to use his seed, not a printâ€¦And there&#039;s a limit to how long I can keep sperm alive.&quot;  This passage struck me far more as Nikanj being a conduit for the passage of sperm, taking the place of Joseph (male) because Joseph and Lilith were no longer able to touch one another.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, CZ said, in response to roseblack, &quot;It actually designs the genetic code for its offspring, and as an afterthought returns that design to the female&#039;s body.&quot;  The fact that, even though it has the genetic code, it CANNOT go through gestation, sets it up as male, compared to our base of knowledge and underlying biases going into the book.  It&#039;s not so much an afterthought as an apparent inability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&quot;You&#039;re going to have a baby and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; (roseblack)&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Now that is a far better point, but less directly male. The Ooloi do serve the role of determining birth time (as men did before the advent of birth control in more developed countries, and still do in less developed ones) but it is a subtle, finely tuned, and ultimately stronger dominance than simple penetration.&#039;(CZ)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#039;re arguing that the ooloi are hyper-male, super-male?  Unless there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing.  And while, yes, birth control can prevent birth, on the flip side, some aspect of a man is still necessary to *create* a baby if a woman so desires, so it really is rather impossible to completely remove one gender or the other from procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, not to be discounted, there IS a history of patriarchy in our society, like it or not.  On some respects, the ooloi are neutering the men and turning themselves into hyper-men when it comes to the process of procreation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the second book, it becomes explicitly clear that the ooloi have rendered the &quot;pure&quot; humans sterile to force assimilation with the oankali, or die out as a race.  They say, though, that they have given humans a choice.  It&#039;s not much of a choice, though.  And it completely disempowers humans as individuals, taking away their ability to create their own future.  This has both racial and gendered overtones to it, but seemed worth bringing up at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the ooloi always male?  No.  Compared to how humans are portrayed in the book, all of the oankali have impressively fluid personalities, independent of gender.  I was actually rather struck by how abnormally black and white the treatment human gender was, comparatively.  Perhaps it&#039;s more that there ARE gender distinctions among the humans, whereas they oankali are portrayed as more of an overall group, perhaps because they are the Other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, in the particular instance that roseblack initially spoke of, directly regarding the ooloi&#039;s role in reproduction, the ooloi is given a role of dominance over every other type of creature in its society and human society.  In this specific act, the ooloi is treated as male, when seen through the filter of our own society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>barbarella as feminist?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/132</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I think Barbarella rocks.  Also, I found it to be suprisingly feminist, considering - well, considering everything.  On the surface it&#039;s pretty wonderful in its unselfconscious exploitation of Fonda&#039;s sexuality, but its underlying concepts are much more subversive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.  The guy that sticks around the longest in the film, and the closest thing the film has to a male protagonist.  He&#039;s far from being the standard hero type; actually he&#039;s pretty useless.  He walks into walls and just stands around until Barbarella shouts directions at him, which he quickly obeys before lapsing back into passivity.  She thanks him for saving her life in the appropriately breathless damsel-in-distress fashion, but it&#039;s pretty clear to the audience that he was little more than an extra set of appendages.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Barbarella wastes a lot of time repeatedly rescuing him.  She returns to Pygar his power of flight and tells the evil tyrant to &#039;decrucify the angel or I&#039;ll MELT YOUR FACE,&#039; among other things.  He never really redeems himself.  True, he flies Barbarella into and out of the tyrant&#039;s liar, but the way Barbarella asks, the viewer gets the impression that he&#039;s just the quickest and cheapest mode of transportation and she could find another way if she REALLY wanted.  He acts as little more than motivation for the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any strong male character there to hijack the movie from her, Barbarella is the undisputed star of the show.  Yes, she sleeps with pretty much every (post-puberty) male character she encounters, but she does it without really being sexual at all.  Men beg to sleep with her, and if it&#039;s in her best interests, she shrugs cheerily and says okay.  Sex isn&#039;t taboo, dangerous, or shameful at all for her, so she has no resigned, defeated air of a woman with no other options - no &#039;weeping vrgin&#039; stereotype.  And though she often sleeps with men as a means to an end, neither does she destroy them as do exoticised &#039;black widow&#039; character types.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the movie has distinctly pornographic overtones, it is difficult to really place Barbarella (the character, though not Jane Fonda the actress) in a traditional position of desire.  There is no thrill of excitement, danger, or taboo with her, and it&#039;s much harder to desire and lust over a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>female objectification</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/100</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although Atwood&#039;s The Handmaid&#039;s Tale is often described as a work of feminist literature there are no heroic, or even admirable female characters.  Instead, the cast of female characters serves as an inventory of all the ways a woman can fail in the context of oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
Serena Joy was an advocate for the return of &quot;family values,&quot; she campaigned for women to return to the domestic sphere.  If any woman should have wholeheartedly embraced the Republic of Gilead, it should have been her, but she is not happy.  Offred even wonders: &quot;Which of us is it worse for, her or me?&quot; (95). The only thing she seems to take pleasure in is abusing her power over the other women of the house.  She does have real power over them, particularly Offred, whom she can have sent to the colonies on a moment&#039;s notice.  She punishes Offred for stealing husband&#039;s attention even through the tiny practice of digging her rings into Offred&#039;s hands during the all-important &quot;ceremony.&quot;  Gilead causes makes her hypocritical and cruel.  Aunt Lydia did in fact wholeheartedly embrace the oppressive regime of the Republic of Gilead; she played an active part in its implementation and persistence as a matron of the reeducation centers. She goes beyond simply accepting the oppression, and actually adopts an oppressive role, and she relishes it: &quot;we, sitting in our rows, eyes down, we make her salivate morally.  We are hers to define&quot; (114).  Aunt Lydia is particularly repulsive in her active suppression of the &quot;right to&quot; for women, given that she herself is a woman.&lt;br /&gt;
Janine, a.k.a. Ofwarren, is similarly distasteful because of her apparent acceptance of her existence as a handmaid, even though this appearance is completely contrived.  Though in another context, we might forgive her behavior as a necessary evil for survival, here as readers it is incredibly difficult.  She supplicates herself at the feet of the regime.  She does so literally at the red center &quot;kneel[ing] at the front of the classroom, hands behind her backâ€¦ her red face and dripping nose&quot; and she admits, as to the cause of her rape at the age of 14 &quot;It was my own fault. I led them on. I deserved the pain&quot; (72).  Later, as a handmaid, she partakes in the bloodlust of the particicution.&lt;br /&gt;
Moira, at the beginning of the novel, is promising as a heroic female figure.  She escapes from the red center and becomes the handmaids&#039; &quot;fantasy&quot; (133).  Throughout her time at the Commander&#039;s house Offred fantasizes about the &quot;frisky&quot; Moira at large in the world, as a last remnant of the old world. We finally meet Moira again at Jezebels.  She is, in a certain sense, freer than Offred.  She can smoke, and drink, and have sex with women, she has face cream and drugs, she only works nights.  But she&#039;s not really free, she&#039;s a prostitute, but sells her body for only modest freedom.  She wasn&#039;t supposed to, as Offred says &quot;give in, go along, save her skin,&quot; we, like Offred want &quot;gallantry from her, swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; (249).  But even her spirit is broken.&lt;br /&gt;
The resistance of Ofwarren, our theoretical heroine, is potentially even more pathetic than that of the other women.  She&#039;s incredibly apathetic.  She spends more time making excuses than being angry.  She gives up resisting, to the point of being annoyed by Ofglen&#039;s plans for resistance, simply because of a small sexual outlet, in the form of Nick.  She, more than anyone else, has internalized her oppression.  This fact manifests itself in her descriptions of the world.  She illustrates the world around her in compulsive detail, her justification being that it keeps her mind from her oppression.  However, these descriptions show her obsession with the color red, it shows up more than any other color in her descriptions.  She describes the red of the blood-smile and the Serena Joy&#039;s tulips.  The smell of the flowers in the garden is red.  She comments on the dusk-rose velvet on the drapes in the commander&#039;s house and remembers the veiny redness of a leaf on the ground of the forest when she was captured.  For her, red is the color of her robe, representative of her definition as being functional purely on a biological level, representative of her adultery and shame.  That she should be so aware of it in her life shows how deeply she has internalized her shame.&lt;br /&gt;
Given that this novel is so often read as a work of feminist literature, clearly Atwood wasn&#039;t trying to show that women are weak or inferior to men.  Rather this pervasiveness of shame, and guilt, the fact that they all felt that they &quot;deserved it&quot; (177) goes to show just how debilitating subjugation can be.  An effective oppressive regime can cause even the freest of spirits to surrender if given a small chance for release within the system, whether that release is control over other women, uncertain sexual relief, or forbidden pleasures at a steep cost.  For this reason, the novel is just as humanist as it is feminist.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>heinlein response</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/36</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the many interesting things that Heinlein addresses in Starship Troopers, the thing that captures my attention the most is his discussion of power, both its origins and the ultimate responsibility which comes along with it. As American voters have, over the last fifty years, become less and less engaged in the political discourse and more dissociated from the violence (or threat thereof) from which their political power is derived, Heinlein&#039;s views on this have become even more pertinent, not less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle venue in which Heinlein sets up and discusses the dynamics of power and violence, as well as elaborates on the hypothetical political structure of his novel, is in Rico&#039;s History and Moral Philosophy classes (in high school as well as OCS). Heinlein presents violence as the fundamental source of all political power; even something as passive as a vote for, say, a new healthcare system is an implicit act of violence. The taxes drawn to fund the initiative are collected from the populace forcibly, in that if they fail to pay the government (in which the voter is participating) will jail or otherwise harm them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20th century democracies, claims Rico&#039;s professors, failed essentially because the population had become too far dissociated from their own power. By requiring citizens to have undertaken dangerous Federal service--military or otherwise--the political system ensures conscious enfranchisement; political power is available to anyone, but only if they demonstrate a willingness to endure, and potentially undertake, violence in the name of the state. It was noted in class that there seems to be a heirarchy of possible federal services, with increasing respect corresponding to increasing capacity for destruction (an MI grunt is above a ditch-digger on Venus; a ship&#039;s captain, with the full destructive power of her vessel, is higher still). Though somewhat appalling to many modern readers, this is consistent with Heinlein&#039;s thesis that political power is beget by violence, and thus intensely dangerous. By giving citizenship to those who have enacted violence on behalf of the state, you are not only selecting for a population which has willingly put the welfare of the state ahead of themselves, you are producing a voting class which has consciously wielded  the fundament of political power, and (in theory) is capable of doing so in a respectful, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that, while we are presented with Rico&#039;s clearly biased view of citizens as privileged and in many ways above non-citizens, it is clear that not all of society views citizenship as valuable or even worthy of particular respect. Rico&#039;s father, prior to the outbreak of war, portrays citizenship as unworthy of the effort it requires, telling his son to stay out of politics, as the rest of his family proudly has. In this way, Heinlein shows that the majority of the population is not really politically involved, and isn&#039;t interested in becoming so. Citizenship is, in accordance with its original formulation centuries ago, restricted to those who are involved with and aware of the political issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So a couple thoughts on Heinlein. First of all, although I agree with the below comment that alien races can imply racial connotations, I think that in this case Heinlein used the communal properties of an insectoid race to demonstrate the potential power of a communist social structure in a species adapted to it--and to show it&#039;s fundamental incompatibility with human drives. Second, I think Heinlein&#039;s discussion of the source of political power, though not directly involving race or gender as a major factor, is a potentially useful tool for understanding modern political power relations.&lt;/p&gt;
