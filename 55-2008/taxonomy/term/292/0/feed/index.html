 <title>metaverse(s) and identity</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/289</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this is me freaking out somewhat because I realized halfway through the weekend that I forgot to do my post about Snow Crash...eeeeek. Let&#039;s see what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one enters the Metaverse, an &quot;avatar&quot; or virtual clone of oneself is created and used for interaction. We all seemed to agree in class that there are points in the book in which it&#039;s hard to tell whether Hiro is in the &quot;real world&quot; or the Metaverse; this creates an interesting problem for the whole great American ideal of the secure individual self that no one else can touch. Obviously the Metaverse allows for some distinctive bending of the laws of the natural world; basic actions such as walking, running, talking with others can be executed purely through the power of the mind. One can almost be completely detached from one&#039;s &quot;self&quot; in the Metaverse and yet still be controlling them. Only fighting requires total immersion into one&#039;s virtual self. Where, then, do we draw the line between characteristics that cannot be changed (race, perhaps) and constructed aspects of the self? Or can any human characteristic be changed, i.e. mind over matter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s possible that this book is suggesting a world in which identity is completely a personal and social construct...and that we are either already in that world without realizing it, or moving towards that world. Hiro&#039;s multifaceted racial identity (part black, part Asian by way of...etc.) certainly suggests a purposeful breakdown of racism and a growing inability to pigeonhole anyone based on their appearance or skin color. We talked some in class about the virtual reality game Second Life (which I will admit to having an account on at one point, though I split once I realized actual money was involved) which is similar in theory to the Metaverse, and how its &quot;artificiality&quot; has been positive in some ways, creating an environment in which people of all colors and preferences are free to express themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in an indirect study of the Metaverse, I found myself thinking about something I actually noticed while I was still playing Second Life...often people of non-white races (black, Asian, Indian, etc.) would make their avatars visibly white and then brag about how &quot;white&quot; they were. They blurred the lines, by proudly declaring their actual ethnicity in their avatar&#039;s profile, even if the avatar itself was blonde, pale and very &quot;Aryan&quot; looking. This bothered me a bit. In an odd way, the ability to construct oneself was reinforcing racism and other problems of our society, such as homophobia and religious extremism; but why? Is it because we don&#039;t know how to operate any other way? Does commerce and capitalism require this kind of racial hierarchy? One of my favorite things about sci fi in general is how it pushes people to imagine their world differently and put down their assumptions...so I would hope that we&#039;re not stuck regardless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the main question of the Metaverse is whether we have the same amount of freedom or less freedom than Hiro when it comes to re-creating ourselves; in a virtual reality game we seem to have the same amount, but the problems that we struggle with in the real world end up being re-created. In the real world, it is not recommended to change one&#039;s skin color although it is possible; but, we are in the process of redefining race, and the population of multiracial/multicultural people is expanding. Could our identity be just as malleable in the real world as it is virtually?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Metavirus?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/282</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book, because, in large part, everything had a perfect degree of ludicrousness.  Everything was so foreign, and so unexpected, yet, Neil Stephenson was able to make it believable, by basing the ideas in historic, scientific, sociological, or linguistic fact.  However, this consistency made the advent of the metavirus very strange to me.  He mentions briefly that the bitmap which is presented to the hackers and fries their brains was received from space.  Somehow rife picked it up on radiowaves, but I don&#039;t get how that is even remotely sensible.  Can anyone provide me with any info which sets that notion up in the book: previous passages, scientific theories, etc?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Link of Interest: Snow Crash on TVTropes.org</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/281</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in class, this should be of interest to any fans of Snow Crash, or fiction in general...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&quot; title=&quot;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&quot;&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowCrash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shown Their Work entry seems especially relevant, as now I know more about Sumerian mythology than I ever cared to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Juanita the goddess</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/280</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Though somewhat of a periphery character, Juanita is arguably one of the most powerful characters in Stephenson&#039;s &quot;Snow Crash.&quot;  While most of the people who were working for Lagos are in the project for their physical power, like Ng&#039;s security and the Mafia&#039;s muscle, Juanita is in the project because of her mind, and she is the only one who looks at Lagos&#039; goals and makes her own larger, personal goals in the project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Juanita who first brings Hiro into the project.  She tells him he will be working somewhat under Lagos, but when Hiro meets Lagos at the concert, the man has no interest in Hiro.  This is perhaps the first indication that Juanita may be working at something more than solving the mystery.  By bringing in Hiro, who it seems is of a relatively comparable skill level with computers as Juanita, she frees herself up from her job as hacker to be able to pursue her own goals and work towards achieving her own power goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita and Hiro both use manipulation as a source of power and control.  Hiro, however, keeps this manipulation to a semi-concrete level by manipulating data and computers, but not people directly.  Juanita, on the other hand, is presented as always using her skills as a manipulator on people: she programs the faces in the Metaverse, controlling people&#039;s ability to have life-like interactions.  When she first asks Hiro to join her in the anti-Snow Crash project, she tells him , she tells him  that she will talk to him in the Metaverse, something she usually avoids, &quot;Because of our relationship--when I was writing this--you and I are the only two people who can ever have an honest conversation in the Metaverse&quot; (67).   Juanita&#039;s expressions are on the face of every single female avatar in the Metaverse, and Hiro&#039;s is on all the males.  This gives Juanita a certain god-like quality in the Metaverse, for man and woman are made in her and Hiro&#039;s image.  She can control subtle interactions in the Metaverse without even trying because she has programmed the faces, and because she only truly programmed two faces.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps her most disturbing exercise of power comes when she willingly goes to The Raft and becomes one of the people who is able to speak the ancient original tongue.  When they release the nam-shub of Enki, she refuses to be &quot;cured.&quot;  When Hiro asks why, she says, &quot;I&#039;m a neurolinguistic hacker now, Hiro.  I went through hell to obtain this knowledge.  It&#039;s part of me.  Don&#039;t expect me to submit to a lobotomy&quot; (432).    Yet presumably there are others on the raft who had a similar ability, and she had no qualms about &quot;lobotomizing&quot; them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita&#039;s close personal association with Inanna is a way for her to manifest the superiority she feels to those around her.  By identifying herself as a goddess, Juanita can rationalize doing to others what she will not do to herself.  The fact that she does retain the ability to hack the brainstem is perhaps the most frightening thing about her.  What exactly does she plan to *do* with this ability?  Rife tried to conquer the world with his knowledge of the me and his ability to &quot;hack the brainstem.&quot;  Given Juanita&#039;s past record, it is hard to believe that fundamentally she will do anything all that different from Rife.  Perhaps not on the scale, perhaps far more subtly, but when one can hack the brainstem, when one has god-like power over others, is there truly any way to avoid turning those &quot;inferior&quot; to you into dependent slaves of one sort or another?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&quot;Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/277</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve noticed that most of the other posts are about information, or artificial reality, or something like that, but I&#039;ve decided to post on something that&#039;s a little closer to the range of my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the novel, YT is the object of desire by nearly every single man around her. As one example, the one-eyed man calls her &quot;a hell of a chick. You&#039;re a knockout&quot; (171). Everyone is constantly looking at her, so much so that she feels its loss on the Raft, where everyone except Raven is entirely sexless. The novel seems to portray this overt sexuality as nothing more than a fact of life. If anything, it&#039;s a joke, even though the girl in question is not more than 15 years old. She is constantly mentioning sex with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Roadkill (73,162), and expects Hiro to pursue a relationship with her when she first proposes a partnership - &quot;this is going to end with him trying to get her into bed&quot; (87).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, sex in this novel is portrayed in a relatively positive light. Though blatant sexual desire is mostly associated with unpleasant people (the jail operator in the Clink, the security guards at the Mafia compound, the people in the truck stop, etc.) their desire is essentially harmless, and in fact provides a convenient tool by which they can be exploited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one unpleasant person that I have yet to mention, and the only person that inspires serious sexual desire in another character - Raven, who makes YT &quot;uncomfortably horny&quot; (343). Despite the fact that he basically kidnaps her from her job on the food line, she repeatedly speaks of going on a &quot;date&quot; with him (323, for example), and even in one instance describes him as her &quot;boyfriend&quot; (343). Being attracted to him, and knowing that he is attracted to her, has produced some desire for her to continue their relationship, even though she knows of Raven&#039;s reputation, and has seen some of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the mechanisms of commitment in Snow Crash are relatively simple. When two characters have a mutual sexual desire, this inspires the further desire to be committed to that person. This desire overwhelms any conflicting information that either party might receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you might expect, I think that the desire for commitment is actually quite strong between Raven and YT, as demonstrated by their final interaction. Raven is in a helicopter, flying over as the Kouriers swarm L. Bob Rife, but he&#039;s &quot;not watching any of these things. He&#039;s looking out the window at Y.T.... He grins at her and gives her the thumbs up. Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird&quot; (424). I really think that at this point, Raven admires her. She does not seriously threaten him, and yet she bested him in a sexual contest. In their final interaction, I see a reluctance for Raven to leave Y.T., and a similar reluctance for her to let him go. Why else would Raven focus his attention solely on her? Why else would Y.T. bite her lip as she flips him off? In the vein of the novel, they have been sexually involved, with mutual desire, and that inspires them to continue their association. I should note that YT is far more commited to Raven (desires him, wants to be with him) than she ever really is with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Roadkill. She has not had a satisfying sexual relationship with Roadkill, and so she&#039;s not nearly so invested in their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that Snow Crash provides the &quot;teenage boy&quot; perspective on sexual attraction as it relates to commitment. It is not nearly so nuanced as many of the other novels that we&#039;ve read, but I thought it was interesting that there was so clearly a relationship between sexual satisfaction and commitment. It anchors the spectrum at one end, I think, while The Handmaid&#039;s Tale anchors the spectrum at the other end, where sexuality acts constantly to break up commitments, or to prevent nascent commitments from being realized in a healthy manner.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Snow Crash vs Jennifer Government</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/276</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Both Snow Crash and Jennifer Government postulate a fairly dystopian future.  Snow Crash is very much science fiction, while Jennifer Government is merely fiction, and has nothing really scientific about it.  However, both overlap in their portrayals of business, corporations and government in the future.&lt;br /&gt;
In Snow Crash, large franchises have all the power.  These units are like nation-states, corporations, and gangs all in one.  For instance, there is the Mafia, which alongside its goons and guns for hire, run a large and successful pizza business.  There is the Hong Kong franchise, New South Africa, and among others, the Government franchise.  The government has turned into a for-profit business like the rest of these entities.  All of these entities can battle it out with the minimum of interference by any other organization, because the government doesn&#039;t work the same way as it used to.  Security must be handled by private firms, and all roads and mail are covered by private firms.  It is a darker place if one wants some government supports in their lives.  Jennifer Government postulates the same sort of future, with a few twists that&#039;s make it interesting to the Snow Crash future.  Jennifer Government is set in a world where corporations run everything.  The government has been nearly disbanded, and has only one job now.  The government tracks down criminals and catches them.  The catch is that the victim must pay the government to actually perform this service, because after taxes were abolished, the government needed some form of revenue.  The rest of the world, except for socialist Europe, is under the sway of anarcho-capitalism, which sounds very similar to the economic model in Snow Crash.  Roads are built by private companies, and are all toll roads.  That fact is hinted at in Snow Crash but never said right out.  Companies ally themselves together, and hire private security to keep their Corporations secure.  On one side the corporations hire The Police, a private security company descended from the real police.  This company has the power to throw people in jail that it was hired to arrest, just like in Snow Crash when Y.T. is caught in the burbclave.  On the other side is the NRA, which has evolved from its status to become a paramilitary organization that trains commandos for secret missions for its clients.  It has evolved into a company, just like The Mafia does in Snow Crash.&lt;br /&gt;
Jennifer Government&#039;s premise is a dreary one.  Jennifer Government takes the anarcho-capitalism that is in Snow Crash and drives it to the next level.  War in the world of Jennifer Government means business.  And the firms that are hired have surface to air missiles, tanks and other modern tech.  And they fight huge clashes between corporations.  No one says anything because it isn&#039;t any of their business.  In Snow Crash, the world has not quite progressed to that.  The maneuvers between corporations tend to be lighter.  They are still afraid to come out into the very open.  This would have changed with Rife&#039;s victory, but luckily (for some people) that crisis was averted.  But it is oh so easy to tell how much worse it could be for people if the world in Jennifer Government was the more similar to the world in Snow Crash.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Anarchy in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/275</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The political world in Snow Crash resembles that of an organized anarchy.  We only get a real sense of what the governmental situation in America is like, but we know that the federal government completely collapsed.  The American dollar experienced hyper inflation similar to that of Germany in the early 1920&#039;s, to the point of where trillion dollar bills were almost worthless.  The role of the federal government has been reduced to the equivalent of an overly proud company that thinks it is way more important than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political system that arises resembles organized anarchy, for there is no true law, no inalienable rights, no justice system to protect a newborn child.  However there are rules and protection services offered through the individual franchulates.  This system of franchises combines with the free anarchy left with the disappearance to form a very capitalism rooted form of anarchy.  The different franchulates actually compete and advertise, whether in the real world or the metaverse, for citizens to come join.  Different franchulates carve out specific niches for their customers, such as the New South Africa franchise which offers genetic purity for the stereotypical southern white male.  Company wars manifest themselves in actual gang wars, such as the war depicted between the mafia owned Nova Sicilia and Narcolombia franchises.  This system, just like economic capitalism, leads to large powerful franchises such as Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong, and much smaller specialized franchises such and CosaNostra Pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting parallel to the Anarchy system in the continental United States is found on the raft.  One quote in particular shows this on page 387: &quot;The worst thing that can happen on the Raft is for your neighborhood to get cut loose.  That&#039;s why the raft is such a tangled mess.  Each neighborhood is afraid that the neighboring &#039;hoods are going to gang up on them, cut them loose, leave them to starve in the middle of the Pacific.  So they are constantly finding new ways to tie themselves into each other...&quot;  the raft mirrors anarchy in that there again is no law or inherent rights obtained just by being a part of the raft.  It is a cutthroat, free-for-all society in which any member could get screwed over and not be able to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Stephenson Bias</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/273</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On page 57 of Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson describes the problem that the Black Sun staff has understanding Juanita&#039;s work as &quot;sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.&quot;  To some degree, it seems that he may be, intentionally or not, describing himself.&lt;br /&gt;
	For a male author whose work contains so many female protagonists, Stephenson tends to write them into surprisingly familiar paradigms.  While it&#039;s relatively subtle, his heroines tend to function as sex objects, and operate around the men among them.   Juanita, for instance, despite being the most broadly functional holder of the information in the Babel/Infocalypse stack, abdicates a large portion of the responsibility involved in order to do relatively academic research.  The &#039;real work&#039; of unraveling L. Bob Rife&#039;s evil master plan is left to the men: Mr. Lee, Uncle Enzo, Ng, and Hiro, who, most of the time seems to be involved primarily to the end of getting back together with Juanita.  Even Y.T. describes her as &quot;that piece of tailâ€¦&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Y.T., while pretty much as empowered as anyone can get, is rather disenfranchised, for the simple reason of being 15, and possessing the maturity level of a 15 year old.  She&#039;s mostly just playing with the power she has as a middle class white girl in America, until she&#039;s kidnapped and brought to the Raft.  When she ends up in an unfamiliar place, living as she realizes much of the world lives, she gets scared and stays in her place.  She too ends up needing a man to come rescue her, and once again, Raven ends up helping her cause trouble purely because he&#039;s enamored of her physical charms.&lt;br /&gt;
The frustrating thing about Stephenson is that he&#039;s clearly trying.  Most of his work, and all of his recent work, is built around strong, driven female characters.  However, their power is consistently derived in a fairly traditional form.  Eliza, of the Baroque cycle, possesses astounding business acumen, but is still far more successful at acquiring power through sex, marriage and subtle politicking.  Princess Nell of The Diamond Age takes her astounding skill set and works as a writer for a bordello.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, this may be a critique of Stephenson&#039;s reader base.  His fans consist, in great part of the very same type of well-intentioned male techies he&#039;s describing, each thinking, as they read the sentence, that he&#039;s talking about someone else.  Perhaps the forms of power with which Stephenson endows his female characters are those he thinks will go down most smoothly, and  make the most impression in the end.  Or maybe it&#039;s just disturbing that a smart, thoughtful, modern male science fiction writer still can&#039;t give the women in his novels power unmediated by men.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the red pill or blue pill?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/271</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, judging by the titles of the responses that have come before me, I have chosen a well-trodden path to talk about, but it&#039;s the only question that came up repeatedly for me as I was reading, so I&#039;m going to write about it anyway and hope that some kind of original thought manages to creep its way in somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a popular theme for science fiction writing and film: which to choose, grim reality or blissful illusion?  Somehow, the message is nearly always &quot;choose reality&quot; â€“ Snow Crash is the first text I&#039;ve come across (though I do not claim to have a comprehensive view) that is somewhat value-neutral on the subject.  I say &quot;somewhat&quot; because the two main characters advance such polar opposite viewpoints, both of which seem equally appealing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro is in control and has power in the Metaverse; he is a &quot;warrior prince&quot; in the Metaverse (63).  He is not totally sold on reality, either, saying &quot;when you live in a shithole, there&#039;s always the Metaverse&quot; (63).  Y.T. has a similar kind of control and power in reality; she is pretty much autonomous and is almost always in control of her body and her fate.  She has no qualms about entering into the Metaverse only as a black-and-white, something aficionados of the Metaverse cringe at, and criticizes Hiro at one point (though I cannot find the citation now, of course) for spending too much time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, a friend of mine posed this question to me: If you could have a spouse OR a Hobbes (of the Calvin and Hobbes variety), which would you choose?  It was supposed to be a light question to keep the conversation going, but the ensuing discussion went on for hours.  The advantages and disadvantages of having a spouse are pretty obvious, so I will pass over them for now.  Hobbes would be the perfect best friend â€“ you would have a complete and total understanding of one another, and you would be guaranteed to never meet anyone that could even rival Hobbes for fulfilling interaction and conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for everyone else, he&#039;s imaginary.  You cannot share him with anyone else, so you effectively have to choose between a perfect friendship with one person, and the rest of the world, which does not contain anyone who could be your friend in any real way (they will always pale in comparison to Hobbes).  Compare this to Hiro: does he choose the U-Stor-It or the Metaverse, a reality that he can manipulate and control, a reality more perfect than one he could realistically attain in the real Los Angeles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&#039;s answer is ambiguous, which is a bit of a cop-out, but does prove what a complex question it is.  Snow Crash seems not to be arguing for one kind of reality over another, but a balance of the two.  Hiro criticizes those who never totally leave the Metaverse, describing the gargoyles as &quot;the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporationâ€¦they serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them.  Nothing looks stupiderâ€¦[it] mark[s] the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society (123-124).  However â€“ lest readers think they have landed on a solution to the tension â€“ Hiro becomes a gargoyle later in the book, and that unquestionably saves his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose Hobbes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>thoughts on reality video games, the metaverse...y mas</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/268</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reality tv shows have become more popularized these last few years.  Despite the fact that they&#039;re not intellectually stimulating, don&#039;t have a plot, and are probably not even completely &quot;reality,&quot; people love them!  Reading about the Metaverse made me think about Second Life, which interestingly enough, was modeled after the Metaverse in Snow Crash.  Just like reality shows seem to dominate television these days, games like the Sims entertain by trying to recreate ordinary everyday activities.  I personally don&#039;t understand how this can be interesting; what is the goal of this &quot;game&quot;?  It doesn&#039;t have an end goal, unlike traditional video games.  There is no competition because there are no winners or losers.  If there&#039;s no competition and no purpose, where is the thrill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in Snow Crash, when Hiro still has his job as &quot;The Deliverator,&quot; he claims to like that job because of the life-or-death, &quot;life on the line,&quot; fight or flight adrenaline it induces.  &quot;It&#039;s like being a kamikaze pilot.  Your mind is clear&quot; (5).  Unlike that monotonous cubicle job that he could have as a programmer working for a large corporation, it&#039;s exciting because there is a goal.  Make that delivery in 30 minutes or under, or you&#039;re toast.  Quite literally.  (Isn&#039;t it hilarious that the Mafia is in the pizza delivering industry?  How fitting...) He&#039;s trying to set a PR every time someone orders a pizza.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Life in America&quot; is steeped in meaningless jobs.  Hiro observes that &quot;people just rely on plain old competition...CosaNostra Pizza doesn&#039;t have any competition.  Competition goes against the Mafia ethic&quot; (5).  This corporate version of competition is denigrated.  Interoffice, intraoffice politics, and such rely on competition to generate more success, much in the same vein as the technological advancements that came out of the Cold War: who can do it better?  It&#039;s a &quot;rat race&quot; (5).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro thinks that competition eliminates self-motivation.  &quot;Life in America&quot; has strayed far from the Protestant work ethic that helped capitalism evolve.  There is no innate desire to work hard for moral or familial obligations.  That&#039;s why Hiro likes a job that forces him to operate to the best of his abilities.  &quot;You don&#039;t work harder because you&#039;re competing against some identical operation down the street.  You work harder because everything is on the line. Your name, your honor, your family, your life&quot; (5).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>So I wrote about race.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/267</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Race and racial discrimination are a very large part of Neal Stephenson&#039;s Snow Crash, but they do not manifest in the way we would expect.  In Stephenson&#039;s future world, race becomes defined more by who you work for rather than what your genetics are.  Residents and employees of the various Franchises are granted a sense of exclusive community as per their &quot;citizenship,&quot; and come to distrust and even feud with those from other Franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is genetically half African, half Japanese, and the people he deals with on a regular basis are just as culturally diverse.  Hiro&#039;s very roommate, Vitaly Chernobyl, comes from a very different background:  &quot;Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex-Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev,&quot; (104).  Japanese and Russians have never been on very friendly terms, and I have no idea of the contact levels between Russians and Africans, but I don&#039;t imagine they are long time allies.  Yet the two can get along perfectly fine.  Similarly, Italians and Hiro, Chinese and Japanese, and other individual interracial relationships occur without problem.  This is because racial divisions have moved from original ethnicity to gained citizenship within franchulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most predominant franchise in the novel is The Mafia, an organization unchanged from reality to novel in its power structure.  The Mafia is a very welcoming organization to the individual, evidenced by their advertisements, which portray the head of the franchise, Uncle Enzo, with &quot;his arm around the shoulders of a young wholesome-looking black kid,&quot; or another that says: &quot;NO WAY, JOSÃ‰! Uncle Enzo holding up one hand to stop an Uzi-toting Hispanic scumbag; behind him stands a pan-ethnic phalanx of kids and grannies, resolutely gripping baseball bats and frying pans,&quot; (146).  But when it comes to inter-franchulate relations, the Mafia, like most other franchulates, is not particularly fond of the opposition.  &quot;Most of the franchises are yellow-logoed, wrong-side-of-the-tracks operations like Uptown, Narcolobia, Caymans Plus, Metazania, and The Clink.  But standing out like rocky islands in this swamp are the Nova Sicilia franchulates â€“ beachheads for the Mafia&#039;s effort to outduel the overwhelmingly strong Narcolobia,&quot; (145).  Sure, they could be called rival companies, but their power and operations extend way beyond that of what one would consider corporate.  Franchises even have passports, making them even more like a country than a business:  &quot;They don&#039;t want to let him in.  He flashes his passport; the doors openâ€¦ Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong is an open country, always looking for new citizens, even if they are the poorest Refus,&quot; (328).  Alliances are even formed between them, as the Mafia and Mr. Lee&#039;s people get together in an attempt to overthrow another superpower, L. Bob Rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separation of Ethnicity from a biologically determined factor to an issue of allegiances and subscription is an interesting proposition by Stephenson.  People are learning to classify less along genetic lineage and be less racist I feel, but the idea that something will arise to replace this is a frightening idea.  Stephenson seems to be hinting at ingrained structures of hate and rivalry, which are hard to deny, especially when examining our past as a species, but to say that our future just holds more of the same is a rather pessimistic view, and one I hope does not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Could talk some more about race, but...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/266</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hiro Protagonist is defined from the second page as someone who kicks ass: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment of his and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow. The punks in Gila Highlands weren&#039;t afraid of the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it. But swords require no demonstrations&quot; (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there is some satiric bite to Stephenson&#039;s picture of America as a cross between a streetfight and an NRA convention, but there is rather more to the violence than necessary that particular aim. Which is not to say that Stephenson worries to much about wearing his jokes out, or even advancing the plot smoothly. But there is another motive behind all this--it&#039;s central to Hiro&#039;s development as a character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street cimre. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.  Hiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken&quot; (271)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not plot that drives the violence of the book. It is not satire, either. It isn&#039;t even the congenital obsession of science fiction--the invention of new and amusing ways for characters to fold, spindle and mutilate each other. It is the way Hiro grows. We know he likes swords, we know that he no longer wants to be the world&#039;s baddest motherfucker, and we know that he can administer the coup de grace when he must.  Big parts of Hiro&#039;s personality, as Stephenson presents it, are caught up in the way he fights, and how he feels about that fighting. This seems, somehow, caught up in the way that he constructs gender--when he says all men under twenty-five, he means all men. If it were only Hiro, perhaps this could be overlooked. But it&#039;s not only Hiro, though. All three of the main male characters in SC are killers--Hiro, Raven and Uncle Enzo.  YT, a fifteen-year old girl, also fights when she has to, but it&#039;s non-lethal. She has a sonic skateboard that breaks glass, and pepper spray, and bracelets that give people shocks, but she doesn&#039;t use swords, or guns, or nuclear weapons. But it&#039;s Hiro&#039;s ex-girlfriend, the linguistic hacker Juanita, who shows the difference between men and women in Stephenson most explicity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;First things first,&quot; Juanita says. &quot;The control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Okay, you get ready to grab the tablet, and I&#039;ll take out the control tower.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;How are you going to do that? By cutting people up with swords?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yeah. That&#039;s the only thing they&#039;re good for.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Let&#039;s do it the other way around,&quot; Juanita says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The violence is intended to make the book more entertaining, at least--science fiction readers buy books much more preoccupied with killing than Snow Crash. And it is partly satirical, and Hiro is mocked (gently, compared to the treatment that just about everyone and everything else in the book gets) for it, but there is also a bonding between him and Raven, and Raven and Enzo, over their willingness to fight. A willingness that is needed, to survive in, and save, the America of the future.  For all his parodying, I think that Stephenson, whose vision of America is all the more nightmarish because it is one big free-fire zone, thinks this willingness is worthy of praise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing that concerns me, partly because of the way this novel follows Slow River in our Syllabus: in the not-too-distant future of cyberpunk, Is homosexuality an anachronism? After reading a few cyberpunk novels, I am beginning to wonder about the future of the love that dares not speak its name. Whether due to authorial puritanism or purposeful absence, there is an extreme void in the fiction of Neal Stephenson and William Gibson when it comes to either man-to-man or woman-to-woman love. Gibson skirts around the issue by being farely prudish about sex in general. In Neuromancer, the one encounter between Molly and Case is empty, and lacks any substantial repercussions on either character. Sex is like cyberspace, plug-in and plug-out, only cyberspace is the much more enjoyable of the two activities.  Snow Crash treats sexuality as virtually unchanged from today (with a few technological enhancements, such as the dentata). A natural sexual tension between YT and Hiro builds up through the novel, and much of the plot revolves around Hiro&#039;s desire to reinstate himself with Juanita, and YT&#039;s fling with Raven. Despite the prominence of the sexual side of human interaction, there are few to no references to homosexuality whatsoever in his novel. Where are they? Identity politics definitely exist (look at the apartheid burb-claves), yet no gay identity.  Stephenson&#039;s vision, where commercialized or self-designed avatars act as go-betweens for human interaction on the Street, both point to a redefinition of identity by the sudden lack of physical context to human interaction. In a sympathetic or even passive reading of Gibson or Stephenson, this redefinition implies an abandonment of sexual politics as a viable means of forming community. Considering the embracing of the Internet and WWW by the gay community, the absence of homosexuality in these futurist settings is problematic.  Well, I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>(disjointed) Snow Crash/ eXistenZ response.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/263</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had serious trouble organizing my thoughts while writing this, partly from confusion induced after watching eXistenZ, but here are a few of my thoughts the movie and book together.&lt;br /&gt;
	The difference that I saw in between eXistenZ and Snow Crash was in the great divergence between both the means of entering the Metaverse vs. eXistenZ and the nature of the physical and moral dilemmas that both sides face.  Snow Crash had both viral and moral dilemmas in the Snow Crash virus itself and the underlying religious purposes behind it.  eXistenZ had the moral problem of substituting an entirely realistic &#039;false&#039; world for the real one, in a fashion very near to The Matrix, and the corporeal problems of the creation and use of the different &#039;game pods.&#039;  However, unlike The Matrix, in eXistenZ, it was largely impossible to discover who indeed were the &#039;good guys&#039; and the &#039;bad guys.&#039;  The mix of never knowing what was or wasn&#039;t reality and everyone having different, rapidly changing motives gave this a mystical depth that I think surpasses that of both Snow Crash and The Matrix.&lt;br /&gt;
	To the Realists in eXistenZ, the world that the game programmers create (if they even exist at all) is a threat to morality in that not only does it make the real world less important, it gives its players a world in which there is no real consequence for their actions short of &#039;losing&#039; the game.  This parallels the moral standpoint of video games making players more violent, but to such a realistic extent as to make the &#039;real&#039; violence and the &#039;game&#039; violence indistinguishable.  A sort of paradox similar to the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy is created for the player, in that whatever they think they are doing by their own free will is in fact merely advancing the plot line.  For example, when Jude Law stands up in the Chinese restaurant and yells, &quot;eXistenZ is paused!&quot; he appears to wake up in the room they entered the game from, when in fact later we learn they have only shifted scenes within the game.  I suppose what I am trying to get at here is that since the players can never be sure they are out of the game or not, they can go one of two routes.  They can act as they would in real life, not doing anything major to disrupt the social structure, or they can act on impulse and do as they please (i.e., shoot the waiter.)&lt;br /&gt;
 	After watching eXistenZ, I attempted to think of anything that would seem as weird to people in the past as the game pods appears to us, and I honestly could not think of anything close.  There are similarities in robot prosthetics, but even then, only some of our most advanced prosthetics can use our own nervous systems to recreate natural movements as close to our own, and none can draw all of their power from the body itself as the pods do.  They struck me as technically nothing more than parasites or symbiotic organisms to the human body, only without even any function on their own.  No free will, no purposeful movement; only memory storage.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Swordplay in Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/260</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading Snow Crash, the most consistently jarring ( as in, taking me out of the story ) aspect was Hiro&#039;s swordplay. Though he&#039;s the greatest hacker in the world ( both real world and Metaverse ), he&#039;s equally proud of being the greatest swordsman. He carries his katanas everywhere, and uses them extensively-- not just in the Metaverse, but the real world. A modern-day samurai, with the emphasis on &quot; modern-day &quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s obviously a lot of entertainment inherent to the sword fights, and a lot of that is due to romanticizing the sword. Though rendered obsolete by the invention of guns, swords are arguably more attractive, take more skill to use, are more visceral in the way they dispatch foes. Anyone can point a gun and shoot ( hitting the target being more difficult ), but swordsmanship is a difficult skill, even an art. No wonder they remain popular in fiction, despite being much rarer in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties perfectly into Hiro&#039;s identity; one, in terms of a skill that he would want to practice ( he defines himself by mastering complex tasks, either hacking or swordplay ), two, in terms of ethnic identity ( the Japanese/Nipponese aspects of his background are symbolized in the way he carries his swords with him everywhere ), and three, just as an expression of maschismo. It&#039;s all well and good, but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that this is not Fuedal Japan, this is a Cyberpunk future where firearms are everywhere.  I can get him using his swords in the virtual world, but in reality? Where he&#039;s surrounded by enemies with guns? Where sticking around to cut people up would logically make him a huge target and resultantly get him filled with lead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&#039;s a lot of this &quot; Rule of Cool &quot; stuff in Snow Crash, things like rocketboards and supersonic cyborg attack dogs and what not, but this is particularly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Information Obsession</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/259</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I found most interesting about Snow Crash was its treatment of information.  Clearly in this world information, or &quot;intel&quot; abounds.  The desire for information takes precedence over privacy, as exemplified by Hiro&#039;s experience with the Mob, described at the very beginning of the novel, &quot;he&#039;s in their database now...retinal patterns, DNA, void graph fingerprints, foot prints, palm prints, wrist prints, every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on it and digitized it into their computer&quot; (6).  This information typically not help private by whoever took record of it.  You either need cash or clearance to access any given piece, but once you have those things, the information you can expose yourself to is pretty unlimited, and accessible, as evidenced by Hiro&#039;s description of the Gargoyles.  &quot;You think they&#039;re talking to you,&quot; he explains &quot;but they&#039;re actually poring over the credit record of some stranger on the other side of the room, or identifying the make and model of airplanes plying overhead&quot; (125).&lt;br /&gt;
	I found this reminiscent of the net in &quot;Stars in my Pocket.&quot;  Access to the huge database of information is more widespread in Delany&#039;s world than in Snow Crash, but for those who can access it, the scale of the information seems to be just as broad.  However, the implications of these huge collections of data were different in the two novels.  In Delany&#039;s novel, being exposed to such absurd quantities of information seemed to make any given piece of information arbitrary.  Since it was so obvious that any given person knew such a small proportion of the total information, they didn&#039;t really think of facts as objective things, rather they&#039;re thought of as on the same level as poetry.  The interpretation of information was more important than the information itself.  But in &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; information is power, and money.  Hiro supports himself by collecting &quot;intel&quot; and collecting royalties whenever anyone pays to access it.  Even the most inane of conversations have the potential to bring in the big bucks.  In The Black Sun he overhears a screenwriter complaining about a director who wanted to put a bazooka in a movie.  After Hiro puts the conversation into the Library &quot;a hundred struggling screenwriters will call this conversation up, listen to it over and over until they&#039;ve got it memorized, paying Hiro for the privilege&quot; (65).&lt;br /&gt;
	The obsession with information even bleeds into the narrative of the novel.  The first two pages are rife with metaphor.  &quot;His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.  A bullet will bounce off its arachno-fiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest.  Where his body has bony extremities the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.  To me, this goes beyond world building and screams &quot;Look! I know so much that I can use the properties of activated charcoal and napalm in similes!&quot; Everything is cross-linked and referenced the way that Hiro links up the information he puts in the library.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Heroes</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if anyone here has ever watched Heroes, the television show, but whoever was in charge of the script for that show apparently loves Snow Crash.  There&#039;s the fact that they also named their protagonist Hiro (though I was prepared to write that off as a coincidence, because it is still a play on words).  And then I came across Odessa Texas (which is where most of the action is centered in the first season).  No way is that a coincidence, right?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The colors of Snow Crash</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/257</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I might take a look at the use of color in this novel. After all, the story has a lot of powerful imagery, and it was originally meant to be a &quot;computer-generated graphic novel&quot;, so the design of the imagery must have demanded a lot of attention. Even the title of the book, &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; is a term with some intrinsic color qualities. A snow crash displays &quot;white noise&quot;, &quot;a pattern of black-and-white pixels&quot; (73-74). The black-and-white of the snow crash is a very bad thing: it&#039;s associated with nonsense, an extremely primitive fault with a machine. If you see a snow crash, you&#039;ve witnessed a &quot;system crash... at such a fundamental level&quot; that the graphics output fails (42). It&#039;s both menacing and something to scoff at, a simple failure; a properly-protected computer shouldn&#039;t suffer a snow crash, but if it has been infected with a virus, it might. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also the black-and-white avatars, which tend to draw suspicion and distaste from everyone else. These are &quot;persons who are accessing the Metaverse through cheap public terminals... a lot of whom are run-of-the-mill psycho fans&quot; (41). The grainy black-and-white avatars represent a sort of lower class of Metaverse user, and that lower class apparently consists of generic yet obnoxious characters. &quot;I can&#039;t believe you took a hypercard from a black-and-white person,&quot; Hiro says to Da5id, implying that Da5id would have to be very stupid to do that. It implies that black-and-white people are dangerously unaccountable, and consequently something to distrust or scorn. This is pretty consistent with the black-and-white of the snow crash: in both cases, the grainy mixture of black and white is associated with something both mundane and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, black by itself, or rather, black &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; itself, is associated with power within the novel. The uniform Hiro wears when he is The Deliverator is &quot;black as activated charcoal&quot; (1), making him &quot;a grim vision in ninja black&quot; (5), and &quot;his car is an invisible black lozenge, just a dark place that reflects... the loglo&quot; (7). The equipment of the Deliverator is associated with efficiency, danger, and power. He is stealthy, very fast, and wields tools that are immensely powerful, and all of these tools are black. Similarly, the Metaverse&#039;s number one hacker hangout is &quot;a squat black pyramid&quot; with &quot;a matte black hemisphere... set in the front wall&quot; - &quot;THE BLACK SUN&quot; (39-40). It&#039;s another case of black-on-black, a combination that (unlike black-and-white) is associated with the few most powerful, most dangerous individuals in the Metaverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the colors of advertisements and other businesses. The Kourier service wears a combination of &quot;orange and blue&quot; (13), and the Enforcers uniform is an &quot;acid green uniform&quot; (122). Mr. Lee&#039;s Greater Hong Kong, one of the safest parts of town, is signified by &quot;a green-and-blue sign, soothing and calm in a glare-torn franchise ghetto&quot; (83). The various franchises, and their meaning to the main characters especially, are reflected in the colors they choose for their advertising. Green is security; blue is calm; and orange is flashy but still hip when combined with blue. On the contrary, &quot;cheap, nasty franchises all tend to adopt logos with a lot of bright, hideous yellow in them&quot; (145). These bright, ugly logos are like &quot;radioactive urine&quot;  (145) â€“ associated with the disgusting human waste, and probably something that would be dangerous to be exposed to. In other words, all kinds of bright colors are associated with different franchises, but the colors used tend to say something useful about that franchise. This view is both somewhat anticorporate (the distaste for certain franchises) and simultaneously rooted in the kind of psychology that corporate consumerism requires (the association of colors with brands, with the hope that brands can identify themselves as high-quality simply by choosing the right colors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even the colored uniform of of the couriers, &quot;fly as it may be&quot;, is not always advantageous (259). Even Y.T., who&#039;s normally a very brightly-colored person, between her blond hair and the Kourier uniform, resorts to becoming a &quot;black angel&quot; when it comes down to dangerous business (259). This is when the power-of-the-hackers black convention meets the bright-franchise-colors convention: when Y.T. is working for her franchise, she uses the colors, but when she wants power she reverts her clothing to black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So throughout the book, lots of colors have pretty strong associations. Black-and-white noise is cheap, mundane, yet dangerous; yellow is disgusting and unhealthy; green is security, and blue is placidity. And of course, though I haven&#039;t discussed it here, red is danger. These associations mostly hold pretty consistently throughout the novel, which both makes it powerful as a visual experience and acts as a subtle but defining feature of the corporately-defined system of &quot;government&quot; and lifestyle that is at the core of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
