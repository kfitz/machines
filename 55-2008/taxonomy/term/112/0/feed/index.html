 <title>&quot;Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/277</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve noticed that most of the other posts are about information, or artificial reality, or something like that, but I&#039;ve decided to post on something that&#039;s a little closer to the range of my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the novel, YT is the object of desire by nearly every single man around her. As one example, the one-eyed man calls her &quot;a hell of a chick. You&#039;re a knockout&quot; (171). Everyone is constantly looking at her, so much so that she feels its loss on the Raft, where everyone except Raven is entirely sexless. The novel seems to portray this overt sexuality as nothing more than a fact of life. If anything, it&#039;s a joke, even though the girl in question is not more than 15 years old. She is constantly mentioning sex with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Roadkill (73,162), and expects Hiro to pursue a relationship with her when she first proposes a partnership - &quot;this is going to end with him trying to get her into bed&quot; (87).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, sex in this novel is portrayed in a relatively positive light. Though blatant sexual desire is mostly associated with unpleasant people (the jail operator in the Clink, the security guards at the Mafia compound, the people in the truck stop, etc.) their desire is essentially harmless, and in fact provides a convenient tool by which they can be exploited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one unpleasant person that I have yet to mention, and the only person that inspires serious sexual desire in another character - Raven, who makes YT &quot;uncomfortably horny&quot; (343). Despite the fact that he basically kidnaps her from her job on the food line, she repeatedly speaks of going on a &quot;date&quot; with him (323, for example), and even in one instance describes him as her &quot;boyfriend&quot; (343). Being attracted to him, and knowing that he is attracted to her, has produced some desire for her to continue their relationship, even though she knows of Raven&#039;s reputation, and has seen some of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the mechanisms of commitment in Snow Crash are relatively simple. When two characters have a mutual sexual desire, this inspires the further desire to be committed to that person. This desire overwhelms any conflicting information that either party might receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you might expect, I think that the desire for commitment is actually quite strong between Raven and YT, as demonstrated by their final interaction. Raven is in a helicopter, flying over as the Kouriers swarm L. Bob Rife, but he&#039;s &quot;not watching any of these things. He&#039;s looking out the window at Y.T.... He grins at her and gives her the thumbs up. Y.T. bites her lower lip and flips him the bird&quot; (424). I really think that at this point, Raven admires her. She does not seriously threaten him, and yet she bested him in a sexual contest. In their final interaction, I see a reluctance for Raven to leave Y.T., and a similar reluctance for her to let him go. Why else would Raven focus his attention solely on her? Why else would Y.T. bite her lip as she flips him off? In the vein of the novel, they have been sexually involved, with mutual desire, and that inspires them to continue their association. I should note that YT is far more commited to Raven (desires him, wants to be with him) than she ever really is with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Roadkill. She has not had a satisfying sexual relationship with Roadkill, and so she&#039;s not nearly so invested in their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that Snow Crash provides the &quot;teenage boy&quot; perspective on sexual attraction as it relates to commitment. It is not nearly so nuanced as many of the other novels that we&#039;ve read, but I thought it was interesting that there was so clearly a relationship between sexual satisfaction and commitment. It anchors the spectrum at one end, I think, while The Handmaid&#039;s Tale anchors the spectrum at the other end, where sexuality acts constantly to break up commitments, or to prevent nascent commitments from being realized in a healthy manner.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex in Slow River.</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/240</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel that the entire novel works to reconcile Lore with the incredibly intimate and damaging rape that occurred in her past. All her experiences outside of the protecting curtain of the Van de Oests functions to give her the perspective and independence from which she can understand and come to accept what happened to her. She must reconcile her own sexual attraction for women with the horrible emotional injury that was inflicted upon her by a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex, throughout the novel, works against this reconciliation. First, obviously, is the event (or series of events) that so damages Lore: Her rape by her mother, Katerine. &quot;She doesn&#039;t know how to describe it. Heavy like the end of everything&quot; (68). This is the fundamental event that makes all the future healing work necessary, and it is entirely sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Lore&#039;s early attempts at reconciliation are damaged, and probably do more harm than good. At the age of 13, &quot;her films fill with porn actors wearing her parents&#039; faces...As her parents become more distant to one another, Lore brings them flesh to flesh&quot; (135). Sexual desire has come early for her, and she needs to find a way to express it, to rationalize it in terms of the damage that has been done to her. And so she fixates on her parents. Though it is the natural choice, because of what has happened to her, it can only have made her psychological damage worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several other examples of how sex works against Lore&#039;s independence and rational thought. Among them: The scene in which Lore films her friends having sex while drugged, for monetary gain (196-7) and the continuous sex work that Lore and Spanner pursue to pay for the aphrodisiac (220, 262, etc). These events, always involving sex, always work against Lore. She cannot reconcile herself with the past when her perspective of sex continues to be corrupted by mixing it with money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important note: Sex between women in this novel always involves penetration, though that is not strictly necessary (235, 220, etc.). It is not the equal sharing of pleasure that it could be. Sex is inherently a violation in Slow River, I think with the purpose of emphasizing the damage that it has done to Lore. It seems that the only solution is abstinence. Lore&#039;s relationship with Magyar is very chaste and intellectual. It is based on their mutual respect, which is followed, instead of led, by physical attraction. Lore can only overcome the damage that has been done to her when she is able to feel this physical attraction in combination with a more abstract mental attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as power for the ooloi</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(This started out as a reply to two separate posts, but got rather long and wandered off a bit on its own argument, so I&#039;m posting it independently, but referencing the posts that inspired parts of it where applicable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply to CZ and his assertion that the Oankali are definitely alien in &lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/152&quot;&gt;his comment to roseblack&#039;s post&lt;/a&gt; --I&#039;m not going to argue that there is a direct correlation between every aspect of the Oankali and humans.  Lacking my own tentacled ooloi, I&#039;d be a bit hard pressed.  I will, however, argue that there are many parallels to be drawn between them and us, particularly pertaining to gender.  That is, if I can be trusted to not be apparently inherently manipulative self.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/151&quot;&gt;As CZ stated in own blog&lt;/A&gt;, the Oankali are not in the moral right they wish to see themselves inhabiting (a self-delusion to which humans themselves are prone).  Taking the argument one step further, they themselves are a hierarchical society, both internally with the submission of the males and females to the ooloi, and in the way they treat humans, who they claim they want as partners in an *equal* trade, instead treating the humans as pets, as Lilith herself explicitly notes when Nikanj first shows her off to the other Oankali its age (54).  One would be hard pressed to argue that the Oankali do not treat the humans as lesser beings than themselves.  There&#039;s a clear power dynamic present, in favor of the Oankali.  Power dynamic implies hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this seemingly inter-species conflict translate to gender?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many respects, it doesn&#039;t.  There is a whole lot being said about race here.  The different races of the humans are mentioned, but not dwelt on because there is such a huge gap between human and oankali.  But there are clear parallels to gender within the power dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, though, I would like to point out that Butler was born in America (right here in LA, actually), and lived here during her life, and she specifically sees her work as commenting on the Western construct of race, and implied, greater Western societal situation.  I will point you in &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.sfwa.org/members/butler/&quot;&gt;this direction&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point into her biography and what she has to say about her work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roseblack brought up the idea that, while less graphic and traditionally violent than our society&#039;s concept of rape, or the flat-out rape attempts portrayed in the book, Nikanj rapes Lilith when it impregnates her in a comment replying to Count Zero&#039;s comment to the original roseblack post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some etymology.  In Middle English, rape meant to do something hurriedly.  By the fifteenth century, though, the word took on the meaning &quot;The act of taking anything by force; violent seizure (of goods), robbery&quot; (noun) and &quot;To rob, strip, plunder (a place). Also used with a group of people as object&quot; (verb) (OED online).   Fundamentally, rape isn&#039;t about sex.  It&#039;s about exerting power over another individual against the other person&#039;s will, power over that person&#039;s body, somehow objectifying that person, and doing this through a means that, nowadays, involves sexual organs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the book.  Regardless of how many different individuals&#039; genetic material Nikanj manipulated and melded and modified to impregnate Lilith with some &quot;perfect&quot; embryo, it is Nikanj who decides that Lilith should be impregnated, without her knowledge or consent, taking control of her own body away from her for its own purposes.  Additionally, this happens just after the humans have realized that, without their knowledge or informed consent, the ooloi have taken away the humans&#039; ability to have any physical contact with one another without extreme discomfort and revulsion.  Additionally, they have rendered the humans sterile without their consent.  The ooloi have manipulated the humans so that the ooloi have complete and utter control over the bodies of the human, control over the humans as objects, and they manipulate the objects sexually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lilith fends off the attempted rape of Allison, she says &quot;There&#039;ll be no rape here...Nobody here is property.  Nobody has the right to the use of anybody else&#039;s body...We stay human.  We treat each other like people, and we get through this like people&quot; (178).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oankali, especially the ooloi, do not abide by this.  The rhetoric of Nikanj made my skin crawl.  It says to Lilith, when discussing the problems that occurred by bonding with the humans before they were sent to the proto-forest, &quot;&#039;But most of us couldn&#039;t wait&#039;...It wrapped a sensory arm around her neck loosely.  &#039;It might have been better for both our peoples if we were not so strongly drawn to you&#039;&quot; (202).  Nikanj is placing the blame for fucking up the humans ON the humans because the humans were just too damned attractive to the Oankali for their own good.  Were the humans all running around in short skirts, asking for it, too?  The Oankali see themselves as indisputable superior to the humans (again, in creeps hierarchy), and thus somehow, the failings of the Oankali are not entirely their own fault.  Later, when Joseph is killed, it&#039;s because the oankali underestimated humans.  There&#039;s an implication that humans, without anyone to moderate them, and too impulsive, violent, and weak-willed for their own good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the second time Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj have sex, Joseph says &quot;No!...You said I could choose.  I&#039;ve made my choice!&quot; to which Nikanj replies &quot;&#039;You have, yes.&#039;  It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment from him.  When he would have backed away, it held him.  It managed to lie down on the bed with him without seeming to force him down.  &#039;You see.  Your body has made a different choice&#039;&quot; (189).  Um, rape much?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&#039;s not something inherently male or female, either on the victim or victimizer&#039;s side of the equation.  In our own society, yes, there&#039;s a tendency for certain genders to act against others, but it&#039;s not a rule, and there are certainly cases of women raping men, men raping men, women raping women, transgendered people raping and being raped by other transgenders, men, and women.  It&#039;s not something inherent to any specific gender.  Certain types/pairings get more coverage and/or happen with more frequency, based on population size, societal expectations that people live down to, the comfort in acknowledging what happened as rape.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes the ooloi male in this instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When push comes to shove, however much we want to skirt around it, when it comes to humans, you&#039;re sterile, you have functional sperm, or you have functional eggs and a functional womb.  As far as the propagation of the species goes, this is it.  While the oankali have their own system of procreation, when they interbreed with the humans, they adopt and must work with certain aspects of human procreative anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the ooloi be seen as a neutered medical professional?  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much of a movement to brand fertility specialists as rapists, or inherently male.  The oankali assert throughout the text that they use organic matter the way we use machines.  So why aren&#039;t the ooloi just cold, clinical medical professionals, using internal labs, probes, and turkey basters instead of synthetic ones?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s because they do not give their patients/hosts/victims a choice in the matter.  And, ultimately, in taking the genetic material, blending it, and then placing it in the womb, the ooloi are serving a function that, while more complex than traditional male fertilization in humans, achieves the same end.  Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child.  Without the presence of sperm, the gumball&#039;s just going to roll right out the machine at the end of a woman&#039;s menstrual cycle.  Is the maleness of the ooloi increased by the sensory arms?  Yes.  The imagery is certainly there to be interpreted as phallic at will.  But we don&#039;t know exactly *how* the embryo is inserted.  It&#039;s after Joseph&#039;s death, so not during sex.  The implication is that Nikanj implanted it sometime after Lilith had healed it and was herself recovering.  Again, kinda sketchy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that, because it creates the embryo, the ooloi is actually functioning more as a female.  Really long fallopian tubes, maybe.  It just doesn&#039;t ring true for me.  I think what really drove the masculinity of the ooloi in procreation home for me was, on page 246, when Nikanj tells Lilith she&#039;s pregnant--&quot;I have made you pregnant with Joseph&#039;s child.  I wouldn&#039;t have done it so soon, but I wanted to use his seed, not a printâ€¦And there&#039;s a limit to how long I can keep sperm alive.&quot;  This passage struck me far more as Nikanj being a conduit for the passage of sperm, taking the place of Joseph (male) because Joseph and Lilith were no longer able to touch one another.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, CZ said, in response to roseblack, &quot;It actually designs the genetic code for its offspring, and as an afterthought returns that design to the female&#039;s body.&quot;  The fact that, even though it has the genetic code, it CANNOT go through gestation, sets it up as male, compared to our base of knowledge and underlying biases going into the book.  It&#039;s not so much an afterthought as an apparent inability.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&quot;You&#039;re going to have a baby and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; (roseblack)&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Now that is a far better point, but less directly male. The Ooloi do serve the role of determining birth time (as men did before the advent of birth control in more developed countries, and still do in less developed ones) but it is a subtle, finely tuned, and ultimately stronger dominance than simple penetration.&#039;(CZ)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#039;re arguing that the ooloi are hyper-male, super-male?  Unless there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing.  And while, yes, birth control can prevent birth, on the flip side, some aspect of a man is still necessary to *create* a baby if a woman so desires, so it really is rather impossible to completely remove one gender or the other from procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, not to be discounted, there IS a history of patriarchy in our society, like it or not.  On some respects, the ooloi are neutering the men and turning themselves into hyper-men when it comes to the process of procreation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the second book, it becomes explicitly clear that the ooloi have rendered the &quot;pure&quot; humans sterile to force assimilation with the oankali, or die out as a race.  They say, though, that they have given humans a choice.  It&#039;s not much of a choice, though.  And it completely disempowers humans as individuals, taking away their ability to create their own future.  This has both racial and gendered overtones to it, but seemed worth bringing up at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the ooloi always male?  No.  Compared to how humans are portrayed in the book, all of the oankali have impressively fluid personalities, independent of gender.  I was actually rather struck by how abnormally black and white the treatment human gender was, comparatively.  Perhaps it&#039;s more that there ARE gender distinctions among the humans, whereas they oankali are portrayed as more of an overall group, perhaps because they are the Other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT, in the particular instance that roseblack initially spoke of, directly regarding the ooloi&#039;s role in reproduction, the ooloi is given a role of dominance over every other type of creature in its society and human society.  In this specific act, the ooloi is treated as male, when seen through the filter of our own society.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sex as Hope in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/105</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/99&quot;&gt;dreamfall17&#039;s comments about the loss of hope in Children of Men&lt;/a&gt;, I did some thinking about hope in The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, and stumbled on the idea â€“ which I presume to see, at least â€“ that sex is the predominant source of hope in this novel. Constantly, various male characters in the book seem to be offering illicit intercourse to Offred â€“ from the doctor offering to impregnate her (60-61) to the young Guardian who looks her in the eye, implying some sort of sexual possibility (21). Even though she does not take them up on these offers, they provide her the opportunity to imagine having the freedom to do so. These &quot;moments [that] are the rewards&quot; Offred keeps &quot;like the candy [she] hoarded as a child&quot; (21) â€“ just the minuscule breaking of rules which permits Offred to imagine &quot;what if&quot; they secretly met romantically. Similarly, the way she can make &quot;the full red skirt sway&quot; like &quot;teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach&quot; is a source of &quot;power&quot; (22). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Nick and Fred provide similar hope: the pleasure of Nick&#039;s approach in the sitting room is a refreshing pleasure: &quot;It&#039;s so good, to be touched by someone, to be felt so greedily, to feel so greedy&quot; - almost as if Luke had returned to her (99). Every encounter like this provides a hint that the desexualized â€“ or rather, desensualized â€“ society of Gilead isn&#039;t inevitable, that there are others like Offred who want to have â€“ dare I say â€“ &quot;sexy encounters&quot; with each other and will go to great lengths to do so. Just like the scene where Fred hands her a preserved copy of Vogue and watches her read through it. It&#039;s not sex â€“ but with the content of those magazines being what they are, it&#039;s still a &quot;naughty&quot; pleasure beyond just breaking the rules (157).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only actual &quot;sexual act&quot; regularly occurring in Offred&#039;s life is not hopeful. It is &quot;performed... in a perfunctory way&quot; (160) with only the emotion of embarrassment. So it&#039;s sex, but it&#039;s not sexuality. In reality, the true hope in the book is not the act of intercourse, but the act of &lt;em&gt;lovemaking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Buggery in Ender&#039;s Game</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/88</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether anyone else read Ender&#039;s Game with Starship Troopers this semester--or had read it before--but I just read this interesting post on the Feminist SF blog--I was actually linked to it from Paper Cuts--about Orson Scott Card&#039;s winning the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which, I also learned, is some sort of important lifetime achievement award for YA lit. The thrust of the post is that Card is a horrible bigot and shouldn&#039;t be touted as a credible voice for young people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a link to the post: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot; title=&quot;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&quot;&gt;http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=275&lt;/a&gt;. It has some quotations from essays and stuff that Card has written that are really awful and disgustingly homophobic. If you&#039;re interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, I thought, was this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;al Says:&lt;br /&gt;
January 29th, 2008 at 2:32 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i knew he was a homophobe before i read ender&#039;s game, but i still read it on someone&#039;s recommendation. i thought it was pretty interesting that the bad guys were referred to as &quot;buggers&quot; and that it found it&#039;s way to being a slur amongst the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i mean, i know they were &#039;bugs&#039;. but there is no way osc didn&#039;t know what buggery (and buggers) was.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really can&#039;t fathom how I missed that one. The phrase is so clearly sexual. And there&#039;s loads of (occasionally naked) homoerotic boy-play in the Battle School. Most of it more or less innocuous, though, which is interesting, given Card&#039;s self-professed beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know whether there&#039;s anything productive to be done with this in Starship Troopers--the word in Ender&#039;s Game is also clearly a reference to the bad guys in ST--but if anyone wants to take a shot at it, I&#039;d be interested to see what we could come up with, readings-wise.  We talked a lot about gendered readings of ST, but not so much about the potential for queer readings. Not sure how much potential there is, but I thought I&#039;d throw it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Moira--Freeeeeedooooommmmmm</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/86</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;*I think I have a different addition, so my page numbers are probably very wrong. Sorry about that*&lt;br /&gt;
I was unbelievably excited about the existence of Handmaid&#039;s Tale on this syllabus.  For one, it&#039;s one of my favorite books (apologies to the people who hate Atwood&#039;s constant metaphors).  Also, I didn&#039;t even think about it as being Science Fiction.  After reading Suvin&#039;s article, however, I had to redefine my definition of Science Fiction (at least a little).  Handmaid&#039;s Tale does seem to fit into his definition rather nicely, plopping its readers into the middle of a society that both could have come from ours and is shockingly different.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Offred doesn&#039;t really seem to fit into either of the two stereotypes we discussed in class: she&#039;s certainly not an ass-kicker, and she doesn&#039;t scream &quot;damsel in distress,&quot; either.  I wonder if this is at least partly due to Margaret Atwood&#039;s own gender.  However, I was interested to notice the character of Moira, who does seem to, at first, fall into that first category.  Offred even says, &quot;Moira was our fantasy&quot; (133).  The idealized female moves from a masculine fantasy to a feminine one, representing escape and freedom.  However, we later discover that she really is a fantasy for both genders, acting as a prostitute in the club the Commander haunts.    Offred&#039;s dream of &quot;gallantry from [Moira], swashbuckling, heroism, single-handed combat&quot; is lost in the prostitute that she&#039;s become (249).   Offred and Moira take two separate paths, but they both wind up serving men, and Moira&#039;s track is, societally, much more degrading. Handmaid&#039;s Tale takes the one female character who seems to have a dollop of a chance at freedom and puts her in the most degrading possible job.&lt;br /&gt;
However, her prostitution reminds me a lot of Molly&#039;s selling her body to get her implants: Moira sells her own body to get the few scraps of freedom that she can, admitting that she&#039;s &quot;not a martyr&quot; (249).  In some ways, Moira&#039;s character shows the perversion that her society has put into the minds of its women: the only escape is through sex, and that really is no escape at all.&lt;/p&gt;
