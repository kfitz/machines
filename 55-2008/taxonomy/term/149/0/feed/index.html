 <title>Insanity in Karhide</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2008/node/113</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Slightly departing from the central themes of the course, I was very interested in the concept of mental illness on Gethen.  Obviously, insanity acts as a catalyst in the novel, simply by leading the king to order Estraven&#039;s exile.  However, madness is less abhorred than respected in this culture, something that the narrator seems to find distasteful: he asks, confused &quot;if these two psychopaths could not be cured&quot; (Le Guin 63).  There is a definite admiration found in the Karhider&#039;s voice when he responds, &quot;Would you cure a singer of his voice?&quot; (Le Guin 63).  Although the Foretellers might perhaps be outliers (Oracles at Delphi, if you will), the king&#039;s madness leads me to think that insanity is a quality respected in Gethen.  Everyone seems to understand that the king is absolutely insane.  The narrator confesses it openly, tossing it in almost as a joke: &quot;If this is the Royal Music, no wonder the kings of Karhide are all mad&quot; (Le Guin 3).&lt;br /&gt;
However, the insane king does not prove to be the most malicious one.  The sheer stability and cautiousness of the other government&#039;s bureaucracy is much more dangerous than Argaven&#039;s pure madness: &quot;It was odd that in the less primitive society, the more sinister note was struck&quot; (Le Guin 144).  Le Guin obviously chose to make Argaven insane for a reason; through this madness, she avoided portraying him as a completely idealized monarch.  However, it also serves to make the Karhide society less intimidating and sinister and more oddly comical, a nation with a fool for a king.&lt;/p&gt;
