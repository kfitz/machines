 <title>Aliens Like Shakespeare, Too</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;As a humanist leech, I sometimes feel left out of certain SF authors&#039; visions of the future. In Starship Troopers, disciplines like philosophy are entirely ceded to the sciences--viz. the constant references to &quot;mathematically verifiable moral truths.&quot; And this is to say nothing of the uses of mimetic representation--a curious absence, given that such visions of the future are made via a sort of mimetic representation. We talked in class about whether there was art on Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness. In Lilith&#039;s Brood, Butler explicitly states that there isn&#039;t art among the Resisters. This comes up when it gets revealed that, prior to the war, Gabe used to be an actor by profession. What&#039;s particularly interesting, though, is the way aesthetic experience gets linked with the tactile communication that takes place between constructs and Oankali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, Akin clearly has no idea what it means to be an actor. He describes the phenomenon of performance art in descriptive terms that turn out to be sort of alarming: &quot;Gabe had been an actor. People gave him money and goods so that he would pretend to be someone else&quot; (408). Aside from basic cultural miscommunication, Akin&#039;s objections to Gabe&#039;s acting look, at first, pretty Platonic. &quot;&#039;Didn&#039;t your mother ever tell you any stories?&#039; [Gabe] asked Akin. &#039;Yes,&#039; Akin said. &#039;But they were true&#039;&quot; (408). Here, Akin&#039;s idea is that fiction--or, probably, any other form of mimetic representation--is not a useful endeavor because its empirical falseness renders it a less good way to communicate between persons information about human-/Oankali-nature, the given world, etc. Plato, of course, makes this objection in Book X of the Republic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dovetails unsettlingly with the state of utter destruction that has been wrought on Earth by this time in the novel. &quot;&#039;She never told you about the three bears?&#039; &#039;What&#039;s a bear?&#039;&quot; (408). This perspective shift renders impotent Akin&#039;s attack on acting as well as Gabe&#039;s defense of same. At a certain point, the biological mandate to survive trumps any sort of demands that aesthetic objects impose on us. Art pales in the face of death--or, in this case, extinction. I take this to be a really useful observation that perhaps SF authors, in general, are in a better position to make than other fiction writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabe&#039;s performance of Lear for Akin is described simply as a transformation: &quot;Gabe became an old man&quot; (408). Despite his initial reservations, Akin has a powerful experience of empathic substitution: &quot;Somehowâ€¦he felt what Gabe seemed to want him to feel. Surprise, anger, betrayal, utter bewilderment, despair, madnessâ€¦.&quot; (408). A wide range of the human experience suddenly becomes available to Akin, and he experiences it immanently. It&#039;s an incredible fact about art that it can make subjective experience communicable between persons; that it should also do this between species says something about the real (potential) power of representation in the universe of Lilith&#039;s Brood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, when Akin attempts to describe to Gabe his experience as an audience, he describes it as being similar to a form of communication unique to the Oankali: &quot;It&#039;s like what we do--constructs and Oankali. It&#039;s like when we touch each other and talk with feelings and pressures. Sometimes you have to remember a feeling you haven&#039;t had for a long time and bring it back so you can transmit it to someone else or use a feeling you have about one thing to help someone understand something else&quot; (409). There might not be a better way to paraphrase the purpose of art than to say it&#039;s &quot;talking with feelings and pressures.&quot; The humanist tradition, it turns out, survives, albeit in a semi-recognizable form. But that seems to be a theme in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
