</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>As we discussed rather unsatisfactorily, one of the questions raised about Gibson's Neuromancer concerns the relationship between mind and the body. Can one live without the other? Is one monstrous and one glorified? On the one hand, Case is constantly escaping the bounds of "the meat" by entering cyberspace. He obviously prefers the space of the mind than the body that seems to hold him back, keeping him in the tangible world. At the same time, however, when in cyberspace he visualizes a body for the entity that represents his thought. Moreover, Case is unable to delve into cyberspace unless his body is in working order, especially the wiring of his nervous system. His body may be unimportant as a whole, but certain parts of it and the fact that he is alive let his mind escape in the first place.</p>
<p>From a different perspective, there are very few "cowboys" like Case in the world, people who actually can hack ("jack") into cyberspace. The majority of the populace is forever stuck in the meat. Whether because of this, in spite of this, or in simple unacknowledgement of the possibility of mental escape (at least through cyberspace; obviously drugs can provide some escape), people modify their bodies. Most often it is for reasons of beauty, almost agreeing with Case that the body is an ugly annoyance that needs to be perfected, or opposing him because the body is glorious and must be enhanced and celebrated. Interestingly, Molly makes modifications for more utilitarian reasons; indeed, Molly is something of an anomaly.</p>
<p>"Renting the goods, is all. You aren't in [your body], when it's all happening." (147) The only time Molly's mind is outside her body is when she is a prostitute, a "puppet" (an apt name). What this means as far as the significance of the mind and the body is unclear. Her body provides pleasure for others, but pleasure can be derived by less physical means as well. She is disconnected from her body at this time, suggesting that the deeds her body does are too ugly for her mind, that her mind is above prostitution in some way though her body isn't. Of course, her mind agreed to sell her body in the first place, so this can't exactly be true. Finally, her mind didn't travel to cyberspace or any place equivalent; it seems her mind basically "slept" until the sex was over. Also, after leaving prostitution, she now makes a living selling her body in another way, as a bodyguard. Through Molly, we definitely see the body as more valuable than the mind.</p>
<p>While Molly and Case are somewhere in the middle, at the ends of the spectrum between mind and body are the AI and Armitage. The AI is purely mind, and while this presents many advantages, it also means the AI can't move things in the physical world, which is why he needs Molly and Case. Moreover, the AI is in no way human, just a thinking machine. At the other end lies Armitage, basically a body without a mind. The AI has given Armitage/Corto something of a mind to keep him stable for a time, but there's nothing really there behind the blank blue eyes, as Case often notes uncomfortably. In this way, Armitage appears inhuman, or at least less than human.</p>
<p>This brings to mind (somewhat tangentially) a thought-provoking line in Neuromancer: "Case had always taken it for granted that the real bosses, the kingpins in a given industry, would be both more and less than people." (203) There is something in the job title that requires the "real bosses" to be different somehow than the average human being. Certainly in Case's case (what kind of a name is "Case", anyway?) the real boss is anything but a person. The AI controls the whole team. This suggests that humans are not capable of actually holding power, that machines are better suited to it--kind of a scary thought.</p>
<p>But back to the relationship between mind and body: I think that whether the novel elevates the mind over the body or the other way around, it proves that both are necessary components to being human. There's a reason for the phrase "mind, body, and soul"--we really aren't human if we lack one of these, like the AI or Armitage (the soul is another matter worth exploring, but not, perhaps, alongside Neuromancer). No matter how much Case may crave the freedom of his mind, he needs "the meat" if he wants to stay human. The meat is a part of who he is.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am in complete agreement with your assessment of the book's relationship between mind and body.  Case and Molly function as a team and one can not travel through cyberspace without the other.  While Case may resent his body, his mind alone could not transport him into cyberspace.  And, like you said, his nervous system, while connected to his mind still needed to be rewired in order for his mind to work.  Case's body underwent a trasnformation for the sake of his body.  Molly welcomed numerous alterations on her body so she could use it to her full advantage.  While many were concerned with the physical beauty they could achieve, Molly wanted to gain as much strength as possible.  Her body is her canvas - constantly being reworked until it reaches perfection.  You make an interesting point about Molly's mind being above the prostitution of her body.  I don't know what to think about that.  I feel as though Molly recognizes that in order for her mind to advance, her body must be in a way sacrifiiced.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by DeusExMachina on 8 February 2008 - 1:56pm.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I disagree about Corto - you'll note that he actually does have something of a mind - as I see it, the personality of Armitage is a more "stable" shell built to keep the (psychotic) Corto imprisoned while utilizing its body. But in the end, the shell can't replace the original personality and "Armitage" breaks down entirely. So in Corto's case, even though the mind is severely dysfunctional, in the end that mind triumphs over the artificial non-mind personality that Wintermute creates for him, and reclaims his body. </p>
<p>You do make a good point about physical beauty modifications, compared to Molly - if anything, her attitude can be seen as more utilitarian, more individualistic, and more edgy than those who end up with generic pretty-faces.</p>

    <div class="content"><p><em>Through Molly, we definitely see the body as more valuable than the mind.</em></p>
<p>Is this only true for women, though?  Are women required to remain grounded in the body, so that they can remain sex objects (if ass-kicking ones)?</p>
