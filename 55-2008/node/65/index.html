        <div class="taxonomy">Tagged: <ul class="links inline"><li  class="first last taxonomy_term_87"><a href="../../taxonomy/term/87/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_87">Linda Lee</a></li>
</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Since I wrote my last blog post about race, I decided to write this response paper about gender (mainly just to keep the title of the class going).  I found the women in Neuromancer refreshingly different from the almost non-existent females of Starship Troopers.  The character of Molly was obviously interesting, but I feel like we will talk about her in class even more on Wednesday.  I was actually more interested in Linda Lee, Case's arcade-haunting girlfriend.  She seems to be a constant presence in the novel, and acts, at times, as Case's motivation for his actions.  However, her character is always mysterious.  She was, to me, almost as ambiguous as Carmencita in Starship Troopers.  She appeared as the object of his desire, but she never really seemed to have much of a personality.  The reader's sole extended interaction with her is a situation in which even Case admits, "she wasn't real" (235).  Other than that, the only glimpses into her character are through Case's idealized memory of her.<br />
	The actual interactions with Linda at the very beginning of the book are interesting, but short-lived.  One of the things that I found most fascinating was her physical description.  Case's descriptions of Linda give the impression of a junkie that is simply falling apart at the edges: Her eyes are always "rimmed with smudged black paintstick" (8), and her "skinâ€¦was pale and unhealthy-looking" (9).  In general, the initial image of Linda Lee is not particularly flattering.  She is also almost childlike: for all her wear, she is only twenty, and "her upper lip [is] like the line children draw to represent a bird in flight" (8).  Gibson's comments about her actual age and the firmness of her skin contrast starkly with the absolute depravity of 'the hungry armature of [her] addiction" (8).  However, both of these aspects blend to create a futuristic damsel-in-distress.  She has both the carelessness of a child and the complete helplessness of a junkie.<br />
	This perception of Linda as a damsel in distress holds true in her reappearance in the artificial reality towards the end of the novel.  She loses any shred of strength present in that first glimpse of her, and it is replaced by steady tears, "a dry sobbing" (238).  In this alternate reality, Linda becomes a passive character, waiting alone on the beach until the arrival of her man, who she was told would come.  In addition to her damsel-in-distress characteristics, Linda also has a certain homebody-esque quality about her.  She takes Case into her home and gives him food and a place in her bed, instantly accepting him into her world.  In many ways, Linda is the perfect woman for Case, and Neuromancer seems to recognize this yearning.<br />
	Obviously, Linda's personality at the end of the novel is not her own, but a construct of Neuromancer.  However, I find this construct extremely interesting, especially since Case seems to really want her and her world.   If Molly is the ass-kicking stereotype of science-fiction woman, then Linda seems to personify the damsel in distress.  However, her past as a junkie adds an extra dimension of depravity to her distress.  This depravity seems to fit in well with the cyberpunk nature of the novel, in which everything is taken to a lower level of society.  The idealized helplessness of the damsel in distress is degraded to the ultimate sickness of a junkie.  All in all, Case's Linda definitely seems to be a damsel in distress, but I'm not sure if Gibson is mimicking or parodying this image.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>"However, both of these aspects blend to create a futuristic damsel-in-distress. She has both the carelessness of a child and the complete helplessness of a junkie."</p>
<p>Interesting point.  This is jumping ahead a lot, but what you wrote about Linda Lee, I also think can relate to Oryx (not necessarily in the same way; I don't want to elaborate further and give away details of that book), from Oryx and Crake.  </p>
<p>Additionally, connecting this innocence and the perversion of innocence to the article we read about postmodernism and SF/cyberpunk, I feel as though this description of females can also be related to characters from postmodern literature.  One example is Bianca, from Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, or even Ilse.</p>
<p>I was going to write a short blog about this, but I might as well just mention it here, since you brought up the "junkie" aspect of Neuromancer.  One of my first reactions to this book was definitely surprise.  It is a complete jump from ST in that it is grittier because it does focus heavily upon the underground anti-normative culture (another aspect that I connected to other postmodern works).</p>
