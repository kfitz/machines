        <div class="taxonomy">Tagged: <ul class="links inline"><li  class="first taxonomy_term_356"><a href="../../taxonomy/term/356/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_356">Oryx and Crake</a></li>
<li  class="last taxonomy_term_79"><a href="../../taxonomy/term/79/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_79">response</a></li>
</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>What I found most captivating about Oryx and Crake was the total sense of isolation that saturates the book.  The narrative helps in creating this sensation of loneliness because the reader is kept ignorant of the most recent events of Snowman's past up until the very last pages of the book.  As we go along, we have the two separate periods of narration â€“ Jimmy's childhood and family issues, leading to meeting Crake and school, etc. and then Snowman's present.  As we get glimpses of Snowman post-apocalypse, we also relive with him his nostalgia and visit to the events of the past with each memory in chronological order.  Until finally, Jimmy becomes Snowman and the two narratives find one another in time.</p>
<p>The entire book is narrated by Snowman, and aside from superficial insights into the characters of Oryx and Crake (and perhaps even the parental figures of Jimmy and Crake), his is the only point of view we experience throughout the book.  When we see him react to creations like the ChickieNobs, we understand how to react.  And in his adolescent period when he is playing games with Crake and watching bizarre porn and executions on the internet, the reader sees that there are distinct differences between our reality and his.  While Snowman is not the most agreeable or inspirational character, the reader identifies with him, partly because we adore flawed heroes, but also because, honestly, he's our only choice.</p>
<p>The way Atwood depicts this type of post-apocalyptic devastation creates a truly haunting vision of the future, that is a little too easy to picture.  The sensations of being abandoned by one's entire species can really be felt by the reader because the only characters we ever meet are in Jimmy's head and they are repeatedly made surreal and mirage-like.  The Crakers only help in the most primitive way, appealing to Snowman's need to be with others, feel human touch, and to speak, to remember the words he used to worship (even though the Crakers have no understanding or context for most of them).  Atwood beautifully conveys the emptiness that Snowman feels, realistically simulating the waves of semi-contentment and total despair at the reality of his situation.  It seems to be a common trope of science fiction, but also the genre of zombie movies, to create a fiction in which the hero is alone, isolated, and facing the extinction of all human beings should he/she fail.  In the film Resident Evil: Extinction, there is a similar landscape, dry and exceedingly hot, with supplies, food, and weapons rapidly diminishing while the enemy grows.  Snowman's only enemies were hunger, madness, and the wildlife (including the marauding bands of pigs with people parts).  Obviously, within the context of action films the main character, Alice, has superhuman characteristics and the audience knows from the start that she will triumph over her obstacles.  Part of the appeal of Snowman is that he is Everyman, John Smith, a neurotypical, with absolutely no exceptional skills, no super-attuned senses of physical abilities and there is no certain prediction for his future within this miserable shell of the former world.</p>
<p>It seems particularly upsetting that there is no Hollywood resolution to this book, although it would be difficult to imagine how such a fictional space could have a happy ending.  Even though the book ends incredibly abruptly, with many possibilities and questions for the immediate future, the resolution of the two stories into one at least provides a narrative closure and a degree of satisfaction with how the story concludes.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by dreamfall17 on 30 April 2008 - 1:26am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>The ending to Oryx and Crake reminded me very much of Cormac McCarthy's The Road.  **SPOILERS** everyone go read the Road if you haven't read it and don't read this.  After a book of near-solitude and despair, the boy of McCarthy's novel finds a small group of humans who have survived the Apocalypse, their morals and minds intact.  Though this allows the novel to finish with the only even slightly positive note in the entire book, it is a small comfort.  There are other people around him now, but the world is still dead and there is a finite amount of food.  O&amp;C ends with the same abrupt feel - the positive of look!  he's not alone there is still a future for the human race!  but the hint that perhaps not all is well and good but leaving off before the reader can know for sure.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Oryx and Crake is worse in that respect.  All we know is that other humans do indeed exist, but the book ends without knowing how they react to Jimmy/Snowman at all....as they don't even get to interact with each other.</p>
<p>Plus, the idea of rebuilding the human race doesn't come to mind at all when I think about the ending for Oryx and Crake...its almost as if the possibility doesn't exist in the first place.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Crakes are the future of humans, but it doesn't seem at all very impressive.  They're basically just like any other living creature on the planet...they exist to survive, and little more.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Well, Crake's purpose was that what was could not be rebuilt if only one generation was lost.  No group of scattered remanants will be able to re-create human civilization, and when you look at us on a purely biological level, we're not that valuable.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am intrigued by the statement you make that "on a purely biological level, we're not that valuable."  What does that mean??  What is a biologically valuable organism?  And why is biological value important in the discussion of whether we should survive or not?  I'm not particularly valuable to society or the world, but I would still be really bummed if I died.</p>
