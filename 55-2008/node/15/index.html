</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I would like to preface this response paper by saying that I am not a science fiction reader.  With the exception of Handmaid's Tale, which I read purely on the basis of its being by Atwood, I have never even heard of any of the books on the syllabus.  However, I am an English major, and I thought it downright prejudiced of me to discount an entire genre without even giving it a chance.  That being said, I loved Starship Troopers.  It wasn't a particularly great book--I found myself wincing at the dialogue, for example--but it was, in the words of a very wise friend of mine, "like reading an action movie."<br />
	Fortunately, I feel as though there is much more to the book version of Starship Troopers than the horrific action movie that came of it.  For a while, I toyed with the concept of the Bugs as other races, reduced to nothing more than mindless, vicious killers.  However, I think that this impression doesn't give Heinlein enough credit.  To me, the bugs seemed simply too primitive to be another race, and their creation of separate classes made them more of an anti-caste statement than a racial slur. Rico's volatile hatred of them: "those Bugs make me queasy" made me think of them as nothing more elaborate than another species (13).  In addition to his own personal hatred of the creatures, they are constantly going on "bug hunts," a term that reduces them firmly to animal level. Although it is possible that I am simply too naÃ¯ve to think of anyone as hating another race so much that they could happily "[smack] down any Bugs that showed their ugly heads" (225), it seems that, at least to Rico, the Bugs are nothing more than animals.  Heinlein's book seems, if anything, attempting to disregard the importance of race entirely.<br />
One of the more subtle cues to this racial oblivion comes in the character of the father.  At the beginning of the novel, Rico's father comes off as the most closed-minded character, absolutely adamant against the idea of his son joining the forces.  He was, to me, the least admirable character, and he did not like other races.  Rico's father sees Mr. Dubois as a catalyst for his son's entry into the army.  When he hears Dubois's name, he instantly retorts with, "â€¦a silly name--it suits him.  Foreigner, no doubt" (23).  This comment serves to accentuate the father's close-mindedness and also caused me to second-guess my theory of the Bugs as a vilified other race.  If Heinlein had xenophobic leanings, why would he not put them into the mouth of a more sympathetic character?<br />
Another hint came surprisingly late--the racial identity of the central character.  Only on page 260, when I discovered that Rico's native language was Tagalong, did I realize that he was Filipino.  Obviously, I realized that he was not White (simply because of his last name), but I had no idea that he was Filipino until that line.  This realization means that Heinlein chose to cast a non-White character as the hero of his novel.  In addition to Rico, his "love interest" is also obviously non-White.  With a name like Carmencita Ibanez, she seems intentionally blatantly foreign.<br />
In general, the issues of race don't seem overly important to Heinlein.  He obviously didn't feel like the main character's heritage was very important, and his characters were, in general, unconcerned with race.  He even says that his world's democracy is one "unlimited by race [or] color" (183). However, I was shocked to realize the connection that Heinlein made between their egg-laying and the Chinese population: "â€¦the Bug commissars didn't care any more about expending soldiers than we cared about expending ammo.  Perhaps we could have figured this out about the Bugs by noting the grief the Chinese Hegemony gave the Russo-Anglo-American Alliance" (153).  In all honesty, I was not sure what to make of this comment.  It seemed subtly tossed in, but it really surprised me.<br />
However, I think that this was more a statement about fears of over-population and the expendability of the human race.  The Army is an organization that relishes the idea of abandoning individuality, and I think that Heinlein, despite his military pride, was warning his readers against this very concept.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I like how you're working with the text here, on the whole, though I still hold that lots of the "species" stuff here is related on a deep level to nineteenth century (and earlier) understandings of race as fundamentally biological.  There are tracts galore from the 17th century forward, in fact, that demonstrate an understanding of the aboriginal inhabitants of colonized lands (or the slaves brought to those lands from Africa) as being another species entirely, one meant to be studied from a scientific perspective as a means of exercising fuller control over it...</p>

        <div class="commentTitle"><a href="index.html#comment-67" class="active">Race and socio-economic otherness</a></div>
    <div class="submitted">Submitted by 2NT on 4 February 2008 - 1:01am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I wanted to complicate your reading of bug sociality as an "anti-caste" statement as *opposed* to a racist one. When you say "[T]he bugs seemed simply too primitive to be another race, and their creation of separate classes made them more of an anti-caste statement than a racial slur," I'd offer two responses: </p>
<p>1) the primitivization of otherness is, of course, one of ideology's most potent weapons in the reproduction of oppressive conditions. As KF's post implies, representing the Bugs as "culture-less"â€”i.e., "too primitive" to be considered any kind of genuine (racialized) social orderâ€”harkens back to 18th through early 20th European discourse apropos of African, Middle Eastern, and East Asian peoples (whose social norms were generally depicted as bemusingly vacuous and/or cutely superstitiousâ€”nothing, in short, befitting of legitimate "culture").</p>
<p>2) I think it's important to consider the extent to which socio-economic otherness gets mapped onto / articulated through racialized and gendered divides. Responding to Heinlein's "anti-caste" sentiment, one must immediately ask: Whose societes are putatively caste-based, which is to say, against whom (in terms of real-world countries and populations) is his "anti-caste" critique directed? Just like distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate, or even non-existent, modes of "culture," distinctions between "caste-based" (i.e., illegitimate) hiearchy and  natural and/or meritocratic hierarchy are generally arbitrary and usually say more about the political commitments of the person proposing the distinction than the functioning of the systems being compared. In this case, Heinlein's "anti-caste" sensibility is specific to his contemporaneous Cold War landscape, which means that "caste" refers pejoratively to conditions of state control that discourage bourgeois individuality. Such conditions certainly cleave along geographical, and by the same token, racial, lines. Indeed, Heinlein's *racism* lies in his inability (or unwillingness) to explore how notions of "individual liberty" and "free thought" that we told so dear end up facilitating class- and race-based domination when put toward liberal-capitalistic ends.</p>
