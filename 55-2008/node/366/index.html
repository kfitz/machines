</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Am I the only one in class who does not like BSG? I have made it through the miniseries and first half of the first season and just can't seem to feel any interest in the happenings of the show or the lives of the characters. Frankly, I don't really care what happens and find it all rather boring. Perhaps I am just shallow, but there is something about the whole political-drama-in-space thing that really puts me off when it comes to SF TV and movies. I've always liked comedic stuff with lots of space battles and explosions!!!  Action-adventurey shows I supposeâ€¦ Indiana Jones in space! </p>
<p>Anyway, I don't have any particular reason for this weird double-standard about SF TV (which I didn't even realize I had until trying to watch BSG). I'm sure I am now going to be eaten alive for not appreciating this and that and all the intricacies of the show and whatnot, but I don't think I am going to be getting over this double-standard anytime soon.  So I was just curious as to if there is anyone else who isn't enjoying BSG thus far and if so, why?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I kind of have to agree. I found it an okay distraction from other work I didn't want to do, but it just didn't strike me as this amazing show that so many others see it as. It didn't feel very original. I mean, as I watched the miniseries I thought, hasn't this all been done before in sf? I suppose to some extent every story is similar, but they are told in different ways, and I didn't get that from BSG. The premise was an old idea (I don't mean just because the show is a remake); I felt I could typecast the characters and didn't have a vested interest in any of them. Perhaps it's one of those shows that you have to stick with for a while before it really gets interesting.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I do have to say, it does get better as you go on, especially as it starts to get more politically charged in the subject matter.  Not to mention, it seems like every late first-season and early second-season episode ends in a major cliffhanger.  But I do agree that this show does not have anything particularly unique in it.  Rather, I think as you go on it just starts blending a lot of somewhat clichÃ©d storylines into a greater whole.  For example (trying not to give anything away) later we see the military experts refusing to believe in the messianic figures in the fleet, and the messianic figures starting to get a zealous passion in their duties.  Also, as more humans turn out to be Cylons, there is more and more of this 'can't trust anyone', 'are you who you say you are?!' stuff going on.  Overall, I think it's enjoyable, just nothing really new or original.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was kind of ambivalent about this show.  While I did think some parts were interesting, I couldn't really bring myself to care too much about it.  I think the general concept, plot, and character subplots are interesting, but it just wasn't a show that sucked me in right away.  After our discussion on the older BSG from the 70s, I did view some characters differently (namely, the ones who were men in the original version).  It was also hard to watch, I think, because this is the week right before finals, and I couldn't watch this while multitasking.  There are so many details and small bits of dialogue that you have to pay attention to, in order to understand something later on.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by supergoat on 8 May 2008 - 12:00am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I think that your reasoning for not liking the show offers some interesting insight to how we look at science fiction in general.  For most people, the definition of science fiction is about the setting, not the characters.  In order to qualify for sci-fi it does not have to pursue any sort of goal or have any given direction, but it does have to be set in a "futuristic" sort of world that has some focus on the technology.  When we define a genre by it settings the value of the books, movies, etc. are often judged based on that setting.  For example as mentioned in class, Star Wars is not necessarily amazingly popular because of its characters, but rather because of the awesome setting it has.  This setting is what has spawned so many spinoffs in games and such.  When a show like BSG adds political themes into this setting, it understandably seems almost out of place, and can be very off-putting.  I know that I personally can't stand Star Trek because I feel they have an obligation to blow more stuff up if they are going to set the scene in space with all that sweet technology.  This may seem irrational or shallow but it is what i have been conditioned to expect from such a setting.  I believe that political sci-fi shows will always seem out of place for many people, because that is the price that is paid when a genre is defined by its setting.</p>
