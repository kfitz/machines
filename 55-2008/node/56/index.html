</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Gibson's Neuromancer is a novel that could be discussed at great length in pretty much any context because he has filled it with some extremely complicated characters in a very elaborate context.  One benefit of his choice to mainly depict the areas of Biz and criminal activities is that he has created such a rich image of this one aspect of Case's reality, and it alludes to an even bigger world image that is often suggested in casual comments throughout the book and also all of the scenes set in Freeside.  While he often leaves the reader dangling in terms of defining technology and any kind of easily visualized concept of geography, his descriptions are quite possibly the most fantastic constant.  When discussing such complex and previously unconsidered ideas as a portable reconstruction of a deceased human being's personality and skills that can virtually interact with reality on a certain level, Gibson could very easily confuse readers into putting the book down and never giving it another thought.<br />
What keeps the reader's attention throughout the book's more challenging scenes is Gibson's ability to create such bizarre and vivid images.  He renders characters, both in their physical bodies and their personalities, with unconventional descriptors and sometimes paradoxical qualities.  Interestingly, he will use a highly descriptive passage and later, will revisit what he had been discussing with a casual throw away comment, often incorporating slang (either slang the reader is familiar with from reality, or his own fictional slang).  One example of this is when Gibson is describing Molly's pain as Case experienced it through the simstim connection.<br />
	"Case remembered the injection.  What had they given her?  The pain was still there, but it came through as a tight focus of scrambled impressions.  Neon worms writhing in her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill--his mind recoiled from it.  If he avoided focusing on it, the impressions overlapped, became a sensory equivalent of white noise." (217-218)<br />
Gibson's description of Molly's pain is still difficult to imagine and recreate in one's own sense memory, but his detail, the imagery he conjures to try to convey meaning to his audience is masterful.  On the other hand, earlier in roughly the same scene, Gibson has Wintermute speaking through the Finn and telling Case that "Molly's leg's falling off for starts.  Can't walk." (216)  His balance of the colloquial dialogue of his characters and the extremely vivid and intricate descriptions he uses as narrator force the reader to remain entrenched in the personalities of the characters and the way they relate to the world, but also allow the reader to play with the idea of what these characters are experiencing.  When given an image like "neon worms writhing in her thigh," the reader can only attempt to recreate that sensation, thereby relating more closely and realistically with the character.<br />
	Gibson's use of these two methods of conveying information to the reader reinforces the overarching concept of reality and non-reality, the paradox of experience as virtual and/or "real".  There is such a blurred line between what a character can be said to experience versus dreaming or imagining, and his language only enhances the reader's understanding of that.  The tangible and the intangible are at times inseparable in Case's experience and the contrast between the straight forward expressions of the characters and the convoluted, sensory descriptions in the narrative contribute to a confused sense of reality and experience in Gibson's futuristic space.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Great post. You really put into words a lot of how I felt repeatedly while I was reading -- the endless descriptions and technobabble really got to me.</p>
<p>I had another very diction-specific question (I didn't get to follow it too closely throughout the book because I was distracted by the above issues, so I might be totally making this up):<br />
Do you think that Gibson used particular phrasing to (de)emphasize the separation the mind and body? For example, on page 18 Gibson describes the result of Case's fall: "the impact with pavement drove dull rods of pain through his shins." The fall hurt his shins -- not him, in a holistic/general sense, but rather a specific part of his body.</p>
<p>In this way, it makes sense that when faced with the tantalizing possibility of re-uniting the mind and body, Gibson describes Case's response with "He was still shivering. He couldn't stop shivering" (29). In this moment, the physical action (shivering) is attributed to Case as a whole, not just his body.</p>
<p>Am I totally off base? Are there other/counter examples?</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by LeoniaTavira on 12 February 2008 - 1:53am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I don't know that I'm totally capable of answering your question because it's hard for me to think of specific examples.  But I do think that Gibson very consciously used his descriptions to highlight either the body, the mind or the two parts acting and being impacted as a united whole.  I know in the vaguely remembered parts that I'm thinking of he is specific and none of his descriptions seem cavalier.  I'm sure you could scrutinize all of his descriptions, especially of the body or mind in pain, and come up with deep layering implications.  He leaves a lot of room for the reader to fill in the blanks, in terms of what descriptions are important and what he's trying to push as the more significant in that specific instance, body or mind.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in many versions of the body/mind discourse, there is a third, the spirit or soul that was completely glossed over and ignored in all our discussions.  I think there's probably a great deal to be examined in Neuromancer by opening up a third piece of the human identity.  For example, how would we deal with questions of the soul in terms of the Dixie Flatline?  Or questioning what exactly was able to resurrect Case when he flatlined himself, what part of him was stirred and brought back to life by hearing the Zion dub?</p>
<p>I hope that helps a little, and I'd be interested if anyone has thoughts about the questions Kamin's comments lead me to.</p>
