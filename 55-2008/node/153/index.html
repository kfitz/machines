</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>(This started out as a reply to two separate posts, but got rather long and wandered off a bit on its own argument, so I'm posting it independently, but referencing the posts that inspired parts of it where applicable.)</p>
<p>In reply to CZ and his assertion that the Oankali are definitely alien in <A href="../152/index.html">his comment to roseblack's post</a> --I'm not going to argue that there is a direct correlation between every aspect of the Oankali and humans.  Lacking my own tentacled ooloi, I'd be a bit hard pressed.  I will, however, argue that there are many parallels to be drawn between them and us, particularly pertaining to gender.  That is, if I can be trusted to not be apparently inherently manipulative self.  </p>
<p><A href="../151/index.html">As CZ stated in own blog</A>, the Oankali are not in the moral right they wish to see themselves inhabiting (a self-delusion to which humans themselves are prone).  Taking the argument one step further, they themselves are a hierarchical society, both internally with the submission of the males and females to the ooloi, and in the way they treat humans, who they claim they want as partners in an *equal* trade, instead treating the humans as pets, as Lilith herself explicitly notes when Nikanj first shows her off to the other Oankali its age (54).  One would be hard pressed to argue that the Oankali do not treat the humans as lesser beings than themselves.  There's a clear power dynamic present, in favor of the Oankali.  Power dynamic implies hierarchy.</p>
<p>So how does this seemingly inter-species conflict translate to gender?  </p>
<p>In many respects, it doesn't.  There is a whole lot being said about race here.  The different races of the humans are mentioned, but not dwelt on because there is such a huge gap between human and oankali.  But there are clear parallels to gender within the power dynamic.</p>
<p>Before I get into that, though, I would like to point out that Butler was born in America (right here in LA, actually), and lived here during her life, and she specifically sees her work as commenting on the Western construct of race, and implied, greater Western societal situation.  I will point you in <A href="http://www.sfwa.org/members/butler/">this direction</a> as a starting point into her biography and what she has to say about her work.</p>
<p>Roseblack brought up the idea that, while less graphic and traditionally violent than our society's concept of rape, or the flat-out rape attempts portrayed in the book, Nikanj rapes Lilith when it impregnates her in a comment replying to Count Zero's comment to the original roseblack post.  </p>
<p>First some etymology.  In Middle English, rape meant to do something hurriedly.  By the fifteenth century, though, the word took on the meaning "The act of taking anything by force; violent seizure (of goods), robbery" (noun) and "To rob, strip, plunder (a place). Also used with a group of people as object" (verb) (OED online).   Fundamentally, rape isn't about sex.  It's about exerting power over another individual against the other person's will, power over that person's body, somehow objectifying that person, and doing this through a means that, nowadays, involves sexual organs.  </p>
<p>Back to the book.  Regardless of how many different individuals' genetic material Nikanj manipulated and melded and modified to impregnate Lilith with some "perfect" embryo, it is Nikanj who decides that Lilith should be impregnated, without her knowledge or consent, taking control of her own body away from her for its own purposes.  Additionally, this happens just after the humans have realized that, without their knowledge or informed consent, the ooloi have taken away the humans' ability to have any physical contact with one another without extreme discomfort and revulsion.  Additionally, they have rendered the humans sterile without their consent.  The ooloi have manipulated the humans so that the ooloi have complete and utter control over the bodies of the human, control over the humans as objects, and they manipulate the objects sexually.  </p>
<p>When Lilith fends off the attempted rape of Allison, she says "There'll be no rape here...Nobody here is property.  Nobody has the right to the use of anybody else's body...We stay human.  We treat each other like people, and we get through this like people" (178).  </p>
<p>The oankali, especially the ooloi, do not abide by this.  The rhetoric of Nikanj made my skin crawl.  It says to Lilith, when discussing the problems that occurred by bonding with the humans before they were sent to the proto-forest, "'But most of us couldn't wait'...It wrapped a sensory arm around her neck loosely.  'It might have been better for both our peoples if we were not so strongly drawn to you'" (202).  Nikanj is placing the blame for fucking up the humans ON the humans because the humans were just too damned attractive to the Oankali for their own good.  Were the humans all running around in short skirts, asking for it, too?  The Oankali see themselves as indisputable superior to the humans (again, in creeps hierarchy), and thus somehow, the failings of the Oankali are not entirely their own fault.  Later, when Joseph is killed, it's because the oankali underestimated humans.  There's an implication that humans, without anyone to moderate them, and too impulsive, violent, and weak-willed for their own good.</p>
<p>Additionally, the second time Lilith, Joseph, and Nikanj have sex, Joseph says "No!...You said I could choose.  I've made my choice!" to which Nikanj replies "'You have, yes.'  It opened his jacket with its many-fingered true hands and stripped the garment from him.  When he would have backed away, it held him.  It managed to lie down on the bed with him without seeming to force him down.  'You see.  Your body has made a different choice'" (189).  Um, rape much?  </p>
<p>And it's not something inherently male or female, either on the victim or victimizer's side of the equation.  In our own society, yes, there's a tendency for certain genders to act against others, but it's not a rule, and there are certainly cases of women raping men, men raping men, women raping women, transgendered people raping and being raped by other transgenders, men, and women.  It's not something inherent to any specific gender.  Certain types/pairings get more coverage and/or happen with more frequency, based on population size, societal expectations that people live down to, the comfort in acknowledging what happened as rape.  </p>
<p>So what makes the ooloi male in this instance?</p>
<p> When push comes to shove, however much we want to skirt around it, when it comes to humans, you're sterile, you have functional sperm, or you have functional eggs and a functional womb.  As far as the propagation of the species goes, this is it.  While the oankali have their own system of procreation, when they interbreed with the humans, they adopt and must work with certain aspects of human procreative anatomy.</p>
<p>Could the ooloi be seen as a neutered medical professional?  I don't think there's much of a movement to brand fertility specialists as rapists, or inherently male.  The oankali assert throughout the text that they use organic matter the way we use machines.  So why aren't the ooloi just cold, clinical medical professionals, using internal labs, probes, and turkey basters instead of synthetic ones?  </p>
<p>It's because they do not give their patients/hosts/victims a choice in the matter.  And, ultimately, in taking the genetic material, blending it, and then placing it in the womb, the ooloi are serving a function that, while more complex than traditional male fertilization in humans, achieves the same end.  Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child.  Without the presence of sperm, the gumball's just going to roll right out the machine at the end of a woman's menstrual cycle.  Is the maleness of the ooloi increased by the sensory arms?  Yes.  The imagery is certainly there to be interpreted as phallic at will.  But we don't know exactly *how* the embryo is inserted.  It's after Joseph's death, so not during sex.  The implication is that Nikanj implanted it sometime after Lilith had healed it and was herself recovering.  Again, kinda sketchy.  </p>
<p>It could be argued that, because it creates the embryo, the ooloi is actually functioning more as a female.  Really long fallopian tubes, maybe.  It just doesn't ring true for me.  I think what really drove the masculinity of the ooloi in procreation home for me was, on page 246, when Nikanj tells Lilith she's pregnant--"I have made you pregnant with Joseph's child.  I wouldn't have done it so soon, but I wanted to use his seed, not a printâ€¦And there's a limit to how long I can keep sperm alive."  This passage struck me far more as Nikanj being a conduit for the passage of sperm, taking the place of Joseph (male) because Joseph and Lilith were no longer able to touch one another.  </p>
<p>Also, CZ said, in response to roseblack, "It actually designs the genetic code for its offspring, and as an afterthought returns that design to the female's body."  The fact that, even though it has the genetic code, it CANNOT go through gestation, sets it up as male, compared to our base of knowledge and underlying biases going into the book.  It's not so much an afterthought as an apparent inability.  </p>
<p>Additionally,<br />
""You're going to have a baby and there's nothing you can do about it." (roseblack)<br />
'Now that is a far better point, but less directly male. The Ooloi do serve the role of determining birth time (as men did before the advent of birth control in more developed countries, and still do in less developed ones) but it is a subtle, finely tuned, and ultimately stronger dominance than simple penetration.'(CZ)"</p>
<p>So we're arguing that the ooloi are hyper-male, super-male?  Unless there's something I'm missing.  And while, yes, birth control can prevent birth, on the flip side, some aspect of a man is still necessary to *create* a baby if a woman so desires, so it really is rather impossible to completely remove one gender or the other from procreation.</p>
<p>Also, not to be discounted, there IS a history of patriarchy in our society, like it or not.  On some respects, the ooloi are neutering the men and turning themselves into hyper-men when it comes to the process of procreation.  </p>
<p>In the beginning of the second book, it becomes explicitly clear that the ooloi have rendered the "pure" humans sterile to force assimilation with the oankali, or die out as a race.  They say, though, that they have given humans a choice.  It's not much of a choice, though.  And it completely disempowers humans as individuals, taking away their ability to create their own future.  This has both racial and gendered overtones to it, but seemed worth bringing up at this point.</p>
<p>Are the ooloi always male?  No.  Compared to how humans are portrayed in the book, all of the oankali have impressively fluid personalities, independent of gender.  I was actually rather struck by how abnormally black and white the treatment human gender was, comparatively.  Perhaps it's more that there ARE gender distinctions among the humans, whereas they oankali are portrayed as more of an overall group, perhaps because they are the Other.  </p>
<p>BUT, in the particular instance that roseblack initially spoke of, directly regarding the ooloi's role in reproduction, the ooloi is given a role of dominance over every other type of creature in its society and human society.  In this specific act, the ooloi is treated as male, when seen through the filter of our own society.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I would like to respond with one main point, I think: Dominance does not imply masculinity. </p>
<p>Perhaps I should phrase it this way: By attempting to categorize Nikanj as fulfilling a male role in the novel, through its dominance, you argue implicitly that female roles must be by definition submissive. </p>
<p>Nikanj is dominant, true, and I think that in our traditionally patriarchal society, that is why we see it as male. However, I don't think that it actually fulfills an entirely male role. This is especially true in the Oankali sexual acts.</p>
<p>"Without the presence of the ooloi and the embryo it creates and then plants into the womb, a woman cannot bear a child."</p>
<p>This is true. You portray this as though the ooloi is a surrogate male, simply taking the sperm, fertilizing the egg, and implanting it into the female. That's not true. First of all, you missed one key element: the ooloi must take the sperm from the male. It cannot gestate, true, but it also cannot produce sperm. It may penetrate the female to implant the embryo, but it probably must be penetrated by the male to harvest the sperm. Furthermore, it does not simply take the sperm and push it into the egg, and allow normal cell division to occur. It combines the sperm and egg, and then alters the resulting combination to its own ends. It's almost as if the male and female are necessary but somewhat vestigial parts of what is mainly an ooloi reproductive cycle. The harvesting of the sperm from the male, and the gestation of the fetus in the female are simply necessary biological functions to the ooloi. The ooloi performs an entirely new role.</p>
<p>Beyond the reproductive process, you gave the extensive examples of rape that the ooloi inflict on humans. I completely agree that rape is the correct word for what the ooloi do to Joseph and Lilith (and later, several others). I don't agree that this is an argument for the masculinity of the ooloi. As you argued above, rape has little to do with sex, and a lot to do with power. Ooloi rape is an imposition of power. It is not necessarily non-sexual, but it is neither male nor female. Again, it is ooloi.</p>
<p>I look forward to your response.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by blacklace on 27 February 2008 - 2:30am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I don't think the ooloi, or Nikanj specifically, are/is "male" all the time.  This started out as specifically responding to the impregnation of Lilith, and expanded to look at the use of sexual dominance throughout the book.  </p>
<p>What I would argue is, given Lilith's human, female physiology, impregnation of her is acted in a male fashion.  Yes, there is something more that traditional human maleness in this specific action of the ooloi, but there is the core fact of implantation through some level of penetration of genetic material into a female human womb.  The parallel with this to traditional male-female human reproduction is glaring.</p>
<p>You also brought up the fact that the ooloi extracted/received sperm from Joseph.  In that instance, it would make more sense to map a femaleness onto the ooloi.  What I'm actually finding to be the easiest and most pervasive parallel between the oankali, especially the ooloi, and my own frame of reference is vampires.  Aside from the super-human strength and amazing ability to heal, there's a theory I have come across in criticism of "Dracula" specifically, but also other vampire-related things, that...I guess dual-genders, or subversively genders vampires.  If biting is seen as a stand in for sex (and people like Anne Rice certainly describe it as such), then the vampire is both penetrating and receiving fluid, having both a male and female experience simultaneously, and forcing the inverse upon the victim.  A vampire's bite can turn you into another vampire, somehow morph you into a different species.  And they seem to have that manipulation of the endorphins that the ooloi specialize in going on too.</p>
<p>Yes, the ooloi change the way in which birth happens, in which impregnation happens, and makes it different from our traditional male/female model.  But they seem to me to be more the filter through which the female sees the male, and vice versa, in the act of sex, particularly for the humans with their own accustomed manner of sex, and thus is takes on the opposite gender for each person involved.</p>
<p>I also think it's interesting, the prof mentioned in class Monday that Butler's impetus for writing the books was "what would happen if reproduction took 5 individuals?" yet this love pentagon is only going to be used for the first generation, after which it will return to the oankali norm of 3, a male-construct, a female-construct, and an ooloi-construct.  The triangle-pentagon-triangle progression strikes me as...I guess there's something traditionalizing about it.  Almost like a 2-3-2 progression.  To assimilate the conquered, crazy aberrations on the norm must be done, but then, once the conquered are eradicated in their pure form, the oankali can return to their own way of life, love, and procreation.</p>
<p>So, domination is not inherently male.  What is male about Nikanj, for Lilith, is the way in which it dominates her human body and impregnates her against her will.  Domination happens in the books, and in life, regardless of genders.  The specific mode the domination takes when acted against a specific individual *can* be gendered.</p>
