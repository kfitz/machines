</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Considering the points that the class made on Monday concerning the definition of Science Fiction, the way this novel presents the present psychology of chastisement and punishment outlined in the lecture given by Mr. Dubois to the History and Moral Philosophy class was very interesting. (pg 112-120)  Starting with an effective analogy given to Juan about the training of puppies and ending with an explanation as to why a nation based on "pseudo-psychological nonsense" and a "glorifiedâ€¦mythology of rights" cannot endure, he logically explains how such a society, our society, cannot be stable.<br />
	The beginning analogy of the housebreaking of puppies is very effective in giving a rough example of what should be done to perpetrators of crimes.  After the act, the animal is scolded, his or her nose is rubbed in the 'accident,' and then he is swatted.  This is contrasted to the gang action that was apparently very common in the earlier stages of the novel's history (and in our world today.)  He asserts that by not giving them the proper upbringing as children, more specifically by not including pain in the punishment of crimes, the basic learning instincts of humanity was not utilized, and thus no lesson was learned.  So, on subsequent crimes, when the maximum crime was inflicted, it would be similar to never swatting a puppy, then shooting it after it's still are not housebroken as a full grown dog.<br />
	A girl I the class comments on this, saying how she doesn't mind being swatted once in a while when compared to not being able to be outside at night.  This added point of view, the opposite of the modern idea, is a clever device.  Her ending comment, "Why--that's horrible!", is a very human approach towards a seemingly inhumane way of thinking.  That is, that of increased, violent punishment as opposed to psychological therapy and understanding.  The idea is that the wrong way of thinking, our modern way, is "half fuzzy-headed wishful thinking, half rationalized charlatanry."  Dubois asserts that, "Man has no moral instinct."  This is an extremely nihilistic statement, proposing that not only is man no more than a highly trained animal, but also has no overarching moral sense, like that bestowed by divinity.  After this he goes on to propose that there is no morality, just an elaboration of the instinct to survive.  This is what brings him to the crux of his argument, which are the imperatives of survival that surpass that of the individual, and the loss of this in the old society.<br />
	This includes the survival of family, children, and higher.  In the novel culture especially, the importance of the nation, planet, and even species are placed in higher regard.  By examining the problem faced by the individual in why one feels the need to place one's wellbeing on the line, one can tell how far up the moral ladder one can go.  Whether one is capable of giving one's life for a cause as lofty and obscure as 'the good of mankind.'  The street gang members only reached the level of simple gang obedience; the never were taught or learned to look any higher.  Thus, any attempt to appeal to their morality or better natures is completely useless since there is nothing to appeal to.  They were given every opportunity and every benefit of the doubt, when in truth, says Mr. Dubois, they should have been punished immediately.  That was the major difference; instead of punishment, duty, and morality, they were taught they had rights.  Each juvenile that was pampered, that was not taught right from wrong and had it proven by instinct, was the result of the moral failings of an adult above him or her.  They championed rights they lost all sense of duty, to any level of society.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Dubois's statement that "Man has no moral instinct" struck my attention as well. Many of his arguments against the society we have today say that it is incompetent because people think they have rights and give others no punishment/second chances. I can understand the logic behind these, even if they leave a bad taste in my mought, but his assertion against moral instinct almost scares me. I would hope (perhaps foolhardedly) that most people have a basic sense of "right" and "wrong." Yes, there are always gray areas--hence the strangeness of mathematically proven morals; I would like to see some--but I think the average person does not exactly go around maiming his or her neighbors. That said, I suppose it could simply be Dubois's extended survival morality--maiming neighbors is not good for the species--but then what makes us human? How are we different from the animals also inhabiting the earth? How are we different from the Bugs?</p>
<p>Hm. Maybe we're not.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The trouble you mention about where man derives his morality is a subject which I believe divides us socially.  At the core, I see there being two schools of thought on the subject.  Many, like Heinlein, believe that humans have no inherent moral virtue, because they merely have the instinct to survive.  They only derive morals from societal constructs like religion.  The other side posits that humans have a moral compas built in, and that ultimate morality is achievable through following.  I realize this is an over-simplification, but I believe that it helps us understand potential differences in political ideology, etc.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One does have to wonder to what extent the training of puppies is really an appropriate point of comparison with the raising of children -- after all, you can't reason with a dog, but after some point, at least, human beings do develop the ability to be reasoned with.  There's something awfully functionalist about this vision of the development of moral sense, but then, in a culture that believes that all virtues are mathematically provable, it shouldn't come as much surprise...</p>
