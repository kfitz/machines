</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I found Starship Troopers to be a very disturbing read.  The story effectively chronicles Rico's assimilation into the Mobile Infantry.  It's a story of personal development, however, for such a story to be compelling, the protagonist needs to be a character for which the reader can have some pathos.  For someone like me, who doesn't believe in the necessity for a powerful military, relating to someone who chose to fight might be difficult.  However, Starship Troopers manages a wider appeal by presenting social context for the protagonist's actions.  Heinlein creates a universe where a human society has advanced significantly, to the point where war within the species is unheard of, but is founded on very different principles, which are very alien to me.  This makes character Rico much more sympathetic, because it allows him to have relatable priorities, such as racial equality, civil order, personal freedom, etc.  The only difference is that his ideology, which promotes these ideals, also leads to the notion that military is an integral part of a functional society.  What I found so disturbing in this book was that this ideology, which was contrary to many of my beliefs in a lot of ways, was very self-consistent, and logical in its formulation.<br />
	The philosophy of people in the world of Starship Troopers is that force is a necessary part of maintaining order, and that order, aside from being a benefit in itself, yields prosperity.  On the simplest level, humanity embraces the use of force on a personal level.  Not only is the use of a spanking paddle common in homes and in school for the purpose of behavioral modification, but also, laws are enforced by public whippings.  I describe this as "behavioral modification", because it is apparent that the society's notion of how to maintain order stems from the basic principles in potty-training a puppy.  In Professor Dubois' lecture about the failures of the total democracies (our society), he asks Rico about how to train a puppy not to pee in the house, and Rico responds automatically that, "You scold him so that he knows he's in trouble, you rub his nose in it so that he will know what trouble you mean, you paddle him so that he darn well won't do it again." (114)  Clearly, Rico is conditioned to think that physical force is necessary for changing an individual's undesirable behavior.  However, the idea of behavioral modification through force extends past the notion of the individual to modifying the behavior of a collective.  In a separate lecture by Professor Dubois,  a student presents the idea that violence solves nothing, but he retorts that "Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor," citing the fact that an entire civilization's fate was determined when Roman armies destroyed Carthage. (26)  From this, the primacy of the military and Mobil Infantry becomes apparent.  According to the accepted thinking in this book, to maintain order, it is sometimes necessary to modify the behavior groups of people, or foreign nations, which disrupt order.  The optimal way to do this is to use controlled force, in order to compel a change in behavior.  Effectively, a paddle is to a pup as the Mobil Infantry is to uncooperative nations.<br />
	The view that physical force is such an important part of civil society isn't a disturbing notion in itself, as cultures have espoused it before.  What is most unsettling is the justification is so well conceived.  A large part of the argument stems from the acknowledgement that humans, as well as most species, have evolved with an instinct for survival.  Any threat to survival should compel that species to adapt its behavior to limit that threat.  The philosophy of the future is that any good citizen is motivated by the same thing that a heinous criminal is.  Professor Dubois describes morality as "an elaboration of the instinct to survive." (118)  What he means by this, is that moral code, and other socially beneficial qualities, aren't an inherent quality of man, but have been instilled in him by the society by appealing to his desire so survive.  Unlike, today, in the future, morality is seen as a scientifically justifiable construct.<br />
	As a believer in evolution and science, these arguments are almost convincing.  However, the book reveals a weakness in this view of an effective society.  It claims that running a society is a matter of scientific analysis and proof, however, science requires evidence.  When Rico is taking History and Moral Philosophy as a cadet, the professor asks why the system of veterans voting is most effective, stumping his students.  He admits that "the reason for continuing [this] system is the same as the practical reason for continuing anything: It works satisfactorily." (181)  However, this applies to more than just voting.  It applies to the entire system of government in this futuristic world.  The book claims that this method is most effective by science of empirical evidence, however, as a reader, I have no real evidence that such a system should work, and for that reason, I am no longer presented with a moral dilemma. â˜º</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by Sam Yeager on 30 January 2008 - 2:40am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I see where you are coming from. Isn't it tempting to believe that this type of morality is the culmination of our society? After all, more than any civilization that has ever existed, we believe in the power of observation and objective truth. America is one of the most religious countries in the developed world, but even here science holds the final word in most areas of our lives. Science tells us the right ways to eat, sleep, exercise, find love, raise children, etc., etc. Why shouldn't science tell us how to interact with others? Honestly, this idea is very appealing to me from a scientific perspective. The one thing that has always frustrated me to no end about morality is that it is inherently unprovable. Any moral belief - a "should" or "ought" statement, has to stem from some basic premise. For example, much of modern western morality can be arrived at from either "do what God says in the Old Testament" or "do what Jesus says in the New Testament," with enough (mostly) logical reasoning. But at some point you need that premise, and unless you begin with it or one like it (or several), you really get nowhere.<br />
   Of course, this is somewhat similar to Descartes' skeptical argument in some ways, and may seem as irrelevant to everyday life - Of course, if you start with no premises, no beliefs, it is going to be hard to come up with anything concrete. But the difference lies in the assumptions you have to make to believe in, say, reality, as opposed to a particular moral system. To get around Descartes, all you need to be willing to say is "I choose to believe that there is no evil demon or other supremely powerful being who spends all his time trying to trick me," and you can go on with your life and trust your senses as you normally would. It seems reasonable to almost anyone to accept this. Moral premises, though, tend to be trickier. After all, if I have not been raised to believe the Bible is a holy text, why should I believe in its values any more than those of any other book? If I have not been raised to believe in the golden rule (treat others as you would like to be treated), why should I treat others in any particular way, except that which seems most beneficial to me?<br />
     The scientific morality of Starship Troopers offers at least some form of answer to this question. You mentioned, Greendhedge, that this morality seems to be based on an appeal to evolution and Man's desire to survive. Also, the whole system is justified by an appeal to what "works satisfactorily." These ideas seem to me to be very much in line with the scientific method. After all, science is itself merely an approximation of reality. Scientific theories are not judged by how true they are - after all, who can know that? Instead, they are judged by how well they work. Specifically, a good theory is one that can be usefully and accurately applied to the real world. A good example is Newton's series of laws of motion. Einstein's theory of relativity has essentially proven Newton wrong; the latter's calculations do not account for some fundamental forces and laws of the universe. Still, every beginning physics student learns Newton's laws. Why? Because for most problems, they work simply and accurately, despite being theoretically incorrect or at least incomplete (I am not enough of a physicist to really know which). A mathematical system of morality (essentially the science of dealing with other humans) seems as though it could easily work in a similar way. Of course, there is no way to mathematical way to prove something is right, but it is at least conceivable that there could be some way to prove things about what is or is not beneficial to the survival of the human race. In a society that embraces a mode of thinking (the scientific method) that rewards concrete results far more than theory, it is not at all difficult to believe that such a system could seamlessly replace what we commonly think of as morality. The more I think about this, the more I want to right a paper on what exactly the fundamental differences are between the two systems. For now, though, my point is more basic: A rigorous mathematical system that replaces what we now think of as morality with proofs about what is in humanity's best interest is a little scary (especially when other species enter the picture), and, like many things about our society that are a little scary, does not seem all that farfetched.</p>
