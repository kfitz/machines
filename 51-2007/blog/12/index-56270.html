</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Facade, what a wonderful game! Not only are its graphics very amazingly distracting, but the characters are hilarious. Yes, I am being sarcastic, but not completely. While I played the game three times, if I recall correctly, each time was even more fun than the previous one. The characters didn't like me at all. The first time I was Emily, and then Andrew, and then Steph. I got kicked out for saying random things or for kissing them abruptly. Though I was struggling to get them to talk to me about their relationship, it was interesting to see how condescending Trip really is, and how sad Grace is.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>So, I have been a member of Lemonfingers for about a year now, this is a new version of DeviantArt for writers. The site is not exactly like DeviantArt, but it has the essential elements that DeviantArt holds. Lemonfingers allows its members to post poetry of any type, prose of any type; it has forums where one can discuss poetry, prose and other features of the site. The homepage of the site shows new pieces as well as the different genres, and the announcements regarding the site. As for what I will be analyzing, I suppose the network of people this site has created, as well as what it means to have such accessibility to this medium. Of course, the site is of interest because I am a part of it, but also because it allows many people-- the majority teenagers -- to post what they believe to be poetry, even at its worst. The majority of poems written are cheesy poems about love, clichÃ©d; and there are many small groups that discuss their poetry, but never to the whole intent that it seems it is supposed to be in a writing workshop. Perhaps the site is not supposed to work as a workshop, but more as a means to allow people to get their pieces out there to be read by others. The angle that I will take, well, I don't know if it is clear in what I've already typed, but perhaps the benefits of this type of site as well as the dark side, and the lack of importance given to the medium of writing for expression? I have no clue, yet, but I will try to think of what exactly I will be analyzing. This is my proposal, as for the site it is: <a href="http://www.lemonfingers.com"> Lemonfingers</a></p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>After reading George Landow's "Hypertext and Critical Theory" I realized that the hypertext media sounds more useful as a source of  encyclopedic, references, journals, essays kind of literature rather than a story, or "'high' literature." I mean, I can imagine sitting reading some novel by Thomas Hardy, and thinking about the different aspects of society he is criticizing, and wanting to know more, and clicking on the links that will take me there, and reading a lot of material about Hardy's society, and me never finishing  Jude the Obscure or any other of his novels. It would be a nightmare, but at the same time an easier format to access the vast amount of information regarding any particular aspect of what one is urrently reading.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I played around with the story "Afternoon"--perhaps it should be underlined since it seems like a long story instead of short-- and though it was amusing at the beginning, after awhile it got not only confusing but annoying. When I started pressing return, and or clicking on words, and then going back to the previous page, I realized that some of the clicking--though either clicking of words, or clicking the return key-- still led to the same page. After doing this, and getting over it, I realized that I clicked on the tiger section, and when I was through with it I was taken back to the beginning where I had to choose between the lady and the tiger once more.</p>

It's nonsensical, at least to me, considering that when creating a new form of poetry, one must write a poem as an example of how the new structure is woven in the new form at hand. This is yet another example of how one sort of media evolves and creates a new form of media which at its time of creation is new, but will later be one of the founding members of a new media which will evolve in the future.</p>

I mean, it is basically a program that would allow me to write a story's first copy, and then edit it, and still keep intact the old edition, and then from the second new edition make a whole different new one, and still have the ability to go back to the first one; yes, this is possible in Word, but ELF makes it seem like it'll do it for you automatically, no hassle, no pain of creating a new Word Document, or of inserting brackets to divide from old work to new added pieces. I wish I had one. </p>
<p>   The "Man-Computer Symbiosis" is hopefully too far-fetched to the point to be incapable of actually occurring more than we have seen it in current years.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>"New Media" when it appears is new, a novelty, but as time elapses and as this new media evolves, the process in which it grows mocks the pattern of the old "new media." Does this make sense? What makes this "new media" truly a novelty, if for the most part what is new is just a new version of some old artifact whose name we- as in us regular people- don't even know? Is "new media" simply just a new version of something that already existed somewhere in a different era? But then again, this isn't completely true, there are is some "new media" that is new in its own nature. I am being redundant, but it works for me, I need to rewrite what we've already read to understand the concept to a greater extent than just the surface.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I am not much of a blogger, even if I have over 100 blogs posted on myspace. I have no idea why I just mentioned that, but oh well. I don't read blogs, so I had to search for one that would be amusing for this one blog that I am currently typing out. I don't recall what this blog- which I am currently going to start describing- was really about, but it has some music content. I do recall that-the blog whose link I will be posting soon- has writing pieces about interesting musicians of whom I have never heard, and it also includes bands like Kasabian and artists like Prince. The writers seem to take music seriously and manage to create posts not to the level of a music journalist, but as close as possible in the most colloquial manner. The critical analysis of the music is interesting because of its content of references to well known artists. The blog also manages to have videos or links to actual songs. I tried a link to a song, but it didn't work within ten seconds so I decided to keep on reading the blog instead and closed the page where the song was to appear. So, here is the link to an interesting <a href="http://buddyhead.typepad.com/medication/"> music blog </a>.</p>
