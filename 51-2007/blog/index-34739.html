</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>If asked what a "blog" was during my younger years of high school, I would have answered with an uncertain reference to political forums for "older" people such as my parents, dedicated readers of The Huffington Post.  When my peers (and in turn, myself) discovered such blogging phenomenons as livejournal and myspace, as mentioned in many of the other blogs on our class site, I was first taken aback by how intrusive it seemed to have such open information on the internet at the public's disposal.  What I learned from reading my more blog-savvy friends' entries is that blogs are actually sometimes better used to <em>disguise</em> personal information and thoughts because they allow the writer to identify with <em>anything</em>.  The openness and even anonymity of blogs are opportunitites to present ourselves exactly how we choose with the option to add, omit, embellish, or censor our characters and lifestyles. Many blogs are even tailored to the reception of comments and responses, and writers keep their readers in mind when deciding what to include or not. Blogs warrant attention, controversy, sympathy, or any other response solicitated by their writers.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>It had never thought about how much of the information on the internet comes in blog form. In fact, it wasn't until recently that I realized that I sometimes rely on blogs more than I had previously thought. Although I've never been much of a blog writer and don't read anyone's blog regularly (besides those belonging to friends on Myspace), I often times read reviews for products on blogs. Realizing this led me to thinking about how frequently blogs on the internet are used as a reference or guidance when shopping around from anything ranging from books to iPods. It also made me wonder if marketers and companies pay attention to what bloggers have to say.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>First of all John Barger screams winning documentary short to me; someone in Chicago is looking at a Sundance slot for sure if they make it well.  I'd certainly watch it; he's a fascinating person whose life seems a little off kilter, and as Dibbel has already demonstrated, he's a great jumping off point to examine not only blogging but the larger issue of how interaction with an enormous compendium of data and thus abstraction affect the human condition.  </p>
<p>       It took me a little bit of time to figure out why anyone really cared about the whole blogging phenomenon.  In a world where subcultures full of rite and ritual rise and fade into obscurity every few months without most of the world ever knowing, it is impossible to avoid looking upon anything new and supposedly "important" in the internet world without something of a jaundiced eye.  Blogs, sure, seem to be making waves, and we seem to all interact with them frequently.  But even if Blogging in itself hasn't yet had the impact upon our society that something like television or the atom bomb has for whatever reason, it is nonetheless a point of solid ground from which to start exploring larger issues of human interaction in the age of the mature internet.  That's kind of how I feel about it right now; maybe later I'll see the light and realize just how ridiculously important the rise of blogging is, but at this point I'm much more interested in the larger ideas/movements from which blogging stems, and of which it is a result.</p>

I don't read blogs, so I had to search for one that would be amusing for this one blog that I am currently typing out. I don't recall what this blog- which I am currently going to start describing- was really about, but it has some music content. I do recall that-the blog whose link I will be posting soon- has writing pieces about interesting musicians of whom I have never heard, and it also includes bands like Kasabian and artists like Prince. The writers seem to take music seriously and manage to create posts not to the level of a music journalist, but as close as possible in the most colloquial manner. The critical analysis of the music is interesting because of its content of references to well known artists. The blog also manages to have videos or links to actual songs. I tried a link to a song, but it didn't work within ten seconds so I decided to keep on reading the blog instead and closed the page where the song was to appear. So, here is the link to an interesting <a href="http://buddyhead.typepad.com/medication/"> music blog </a>.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>When reading Ev's colorful quote from "You've Got Blog" about being frustrated about blog evolution (how it's like a kid with great potential but no drive) and the lack of money flow via blogging, I thought of a blogger who's blogging ingenuity (or the ability to dupe others if you look at him cynically) has helped him rake in the cash. Lots of it. <a>Josh Spear</a>, a self-proclaimed 'king of all things cool,' has been blogging his opinion about design, art, books, gadgets,etc. on his blog for the past handful of years - a huge chunk of time considering the short lifespan of blogging thus far, and compounded by the fact that Josh is a mere 22-years old. Somehow Spear has navigated the blogosphere to garner the international attention of hundreds of designers and artists, and thousands of bloggers. What Josh says is cool IS cool . . . he's like the ultimate cabinet of wonders; sifting through life's material goods to promote only the most trendy and cool, Josh, via blogging, has scored a pretty sweet (part-time) job.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>My experience with blogging went from 0 to daily activity last year with the advent of a blog thats very close to my heart, and I'm sure of no consequence to anyone else here.  I think people blog because its the most free and easy form of getting ideas (both your own and links to others) out there for people to see.  The blog that got me going was started by a friend who really didnt have a whole lot to say, and over a 100 posts later still doesnt.  There's no theme or structure other than the creator blogging his random thoughts or stories and everyone else (friends and acquaintances) commenting.  While the form has stayed pretty constant, the function has included idea sharing, story-telling, event-planning, travel-journal, debate forum, and I'm sure many other functions.  While we were all abroad, the blog replaced email as the primary way for everyone to keep in contact and get their jokes in from their respective countries.</p>

Rituals such as kissing at midnight to ensure love within the year and keeping cupboards and wallets filled with food and money in order to guarantee stock and wealth were just two of many examples. Other myths such as the first person who enters your house will influence your life in some way; eating good luck food, wearing new clothes, and yelling loudly at midnight to scare away demons were also addressed.</p>

I was under the impression blogs were a place where people could post public rants and detailed accounts of their daily lives in an online diary; however, blogs aren't just used for social networking. In fact they can be used to try and filter through the excessive amount of information provided by the world wide web. I have found blogs to be quite helpful when looking for a quick answer concerning my computer or car, instead of going through the hassle of waiting on the telephone on hold for forever and then speaking to a support representative. Dibbell's article mentioned that after the introduction of search engines, web logs would most likely die off. I found it surprising that they are still going strong today.</p>

Clearly these blogs, which are themselves filters, need to be filtered. Enter a second rung of community sites that make up what we might be able to call a meta-blogosphere.
