 <description>&lt;p&gt;My experience with blogging went from 0 to daily activity last year with the advent of a blog thats very close to my heart, and I&#039;m sure of no consequence to anyone else here.  I think people blog because its the most free and easy form of getting ideas (both your own and links to others) out there for people to see.  The blog that got me going was started by a friend who really didnt have a whole lot to say, and over a 100 posts later still doesnt.  There&#039;s no theme or structure other than the creator blogging his random thoughts or stories and everyone else (friends and acquaintances) commenting.  While the form has stayed pretty constant, the function has included idea sharing, story-telling, event-planning, travel-journal, debate forum, and I&#039;m sure many other functions.  While we were all abroad, the blog replaced email as the primary way for everyone to keep in contact and get their jokes in from their respective countries.&lt;/p&gt;
