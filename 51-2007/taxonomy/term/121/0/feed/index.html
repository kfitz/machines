 <title>Project proposal</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/179</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My project proposal is to play with the idea of a new media kind of thing that&#039;s heavily image based and nonlinear.  Basically I want to try making a hyperfilm.  The idea of translating film into the new media world is a really interesting one to me and I&#039;ve been kind of thinking about how one might go about doing this for a little while now.  While I&#039;m not entirely confident as to the best way to make a truly &quot;hyper&quot; image medium, I&#039;m willing to take a little preliminary stab at it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our reading, I&#039;ve seen film described in one place as the last surviving form of linear narrative, and I think this is fair.  Film is steeped in past storytelling methods and, just like regular print, it is highly linear.  The viewer&#039;s experience is heavily dependent on the organization of the material, and the principles of linear organization apply here in a very real way.  The sequence of the elements of the story play a key role in determining their meaning and filmmakers, whether on a conscious level or not, and the structure of the piece emerges as the linear sequencing of the encounter between the viewer and the elements of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
