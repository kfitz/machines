 <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&#039;t seen anyone mention them here, but photoblogs are worth addressing. Amateur and professional photographers alike post their own images, and many do so daily. They link to their favorite photos of the day from other photobloggers, just as written-word bloggers link to one another. This network levels the playing field of photographers, granting an amateur the same amount of web real estate as a well-connected professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web is the perfect medium for photography because it is otherwise difficult for a photographer to publish his work. A working photographer could open a gallery exhibition, but then the audience is very limited. He/She could publish a book of photos, but they are expensive and do not sell very well unless the photographer is already well-known. Having photography published in a national publication (eg. National Geographic) is one of the most competitive gigs in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; industry and is unattainable for most. The photoblog is the perfect answer.&lt;/p&gt;
