 <title>web 2.0: problems</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/213</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The line about the language of the internet from the reading &quot;The Virtual Barrio&quot; struck me as odd. He seemed to take issue to the fact that all of the &quot;computer literate&quot; people, and the web as a whole, only spoke English. I don&#039;t see that as a problem being that all of the major websites I use (Google, Amazon, Digg, Espn) are run by huge American corporations appealing to English speaking customers. (Digg doesn&#039;t fall into that category, but is run by English speaking individuals) English is the language of web 2.0 simply because those innovating either speak English, or want the English market. I bet just as much stuff that happens in the .com world is also happening in the Japaneses and Chinese version of .com. The fact that Spanish, or spanglish, is not a major factor in web related content is that the people doing business don&#039;t speak Spanish. Gomez seems to appreciate capitalism in &quot;clothing and video games&quot;, but doesn&#039;t seem to grasp that capitalism is what powers 75% of the internet&#039;s growth. The de facto language of the internet, English, came about because English speakers brought it to the forefront of society. I don&#039;t think you can take issue to the fact that Bill Gates and the Google guys happen to speak English; they were just smarter than everyone else in the entire world and everything went from there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Google + Snoop Dogg = Gizoogle</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/202</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Warschauer article from last week proposed the idea that race/ ethnicity are encoded in language, and therefore online interactions betray a sense of privacy about race/ ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gizoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Gizoogle&lt;/a&gt; is a site that acts just like Google, except that it translates your search results into &quot;Snoop Dogg.&quot; (It doesn&#039;t translate the actual site, just the search results). Check it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this offensive? Is it funny? The makers of this site claim to be huge fans of Snoop . . . is this a good way to pay homage to Mr. Doggy Dogg?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Race and Cyberspace</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/200</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So the readings for today and last class are basically what I am basing my project on. At first, before reading these articles, especially Baileys, I didn&#039;t see the need for race primarily because I imagined people passing as a specific race that they really were not. This offends me because, as I will show in my project, a lot of the attributed characteristics to people are based on stereotypes and assumptions. After the discussion and the reading, however, I realized the reason that some people choose to let people know about their race. As a bi-racial female who grew up in Chicago, race has ALWAYS been a part of my life and I would most likely choose to let people know about my race.&lt;/p&gt;
