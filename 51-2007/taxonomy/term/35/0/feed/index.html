 <title>trusting the web</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I read a &lt;a href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;amp;res=9B00E0D61431F932A15750C0A9629C8B63&amp;amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fL%2fLying&quot; /&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; about the increasing online interactions and their effect on real life or face-to-face interactions. I would have predicted that accesibility of blogging opinions online would create an environment where people would spew any crazy belief that popped into their head and onto a webpage, without really being held accountable for their position. However, it seems that the blogging community has opened up an opportunity for exchange for people to seriously contribute their perspective and be exposed to the ideas and the authentic beliefs of others (people and ideas they might not have been introduced to without blogs). Personally, I am excited about our class wikipedia possibly discovering the interconnectedness of our class. Being a student from an outside school, learning about my classmates through online interactions would make me aware of connections I shared with others in the class that I wouldn&#039;t have the chance to learn about in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
