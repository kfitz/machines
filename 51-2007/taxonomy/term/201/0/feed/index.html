 <title>My Intro to New Media</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/274</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This class has been quite an experience for me. Usually I&#039;ve managed to steer clear of any classes that required significant amounts of work that would be posted online (one class I took had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moodle&quot;&gt;moodle&lt;/a&gt; requirement, but it was pretty light; basic summaries of the reading or responding to others&#039; opinions on it). I think I should have taken this class as a freshman - In fact, I think all freshman should take this class. Maybe I would have gotten more out of the blogging, and been more engaged with the blog, if my academic habits weren&#039;t already so entrenched. (notice how late this post is coming up... that immediacy is one thing I don&#039;t like about the blogging. It&#039;s not something due in class, it&#039;s something outside of class that is really sort of nebulous.) Anyway though, I do think that classes should integrate new media better into the curriculum. Just not classes I&#039;m in. Maybe if we start doing this sort of thing earlier it would be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
