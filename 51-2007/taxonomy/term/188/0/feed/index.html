 <description>&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I keep coming back to the idea of New Media improving education because I think I am probably going to end up in education (in some capacity or another) so these ideas really appeal to me . . . I saw this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/health/30exer.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;article on how DDR is storming P.E. classes&lt;/a&gt; on the Times front page this morning. Cool! I think I probably would have loved to play a danced-based video game in P.E. instead of doing all of those things like volleyball, dodge ball, bowling, basketball, t-ball, soccer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; However, one of the quotes irked me a bit/ got me thinking about the future of our country . . . &quot;What you&#039;re seeing is a move toward activities where you don&#039;t need to be so great at catching and throwing and things like that, so we can appeal to a wider range of kids.&quot; Is this a good idea? Are we going to totally breed out the culture of team sports and replace it with video-based simulacrum? I don&#039;t really know how I feel about that. It was sort of sad to read the quote from one P.E. teacher about how the kids scream in glee over DDR--but they never had that sort of excited reaction to basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
