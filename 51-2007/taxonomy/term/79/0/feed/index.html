 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ridiculously long.  So much time in front of the computer.  The map should be up by 8:00.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lemonfingers Proposal... Lemonfingers? Yes, Lemonfingers...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/111</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have been a member of Lemonfingers for about a year now, this is a new version of DeviantArt for writers. The site is not exactly like DeviantArt, but it has the essential elements that DeviantArt holds. Lemonfingers allows its members to post poetry of any type, prose of any type; it has forums where one can discuss poetry, prose and other features of the site. The homepage of the site shows new pieces as well as the different genres, and the announcements regarding the site. As for what I will be analyzing, I suppose the network of people this site has created, as well as what it means to have such accessibility to this medium. Of course, the site is of interest because I am a part of it, but also because it allows many people-- the majority teenagers -- to post what they believe to be poetry, even at its worst. The majority of poems written are cheesy poems about love, clichÃ©d; and there are many small groups that discuss their poetry, but never to the whole intent that it seems it is supposed to be in a writing workshop. Perhaps the site is not supposed to work as a workshop, but more as a means to allow people to get their pieces out there to be read by others. The angle that I will take, well, I don&#039;t know if it is clear in what I&#039;ve already typed, but perhaps the benefits of this type of site as well as the dark side, and the lack of importance given to the medium of writing for expression? I have no clue, yet, but I will try to think of what exactly I will be analyzing. This is my proposal, as for the site it is: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lemonfingers.com&quot;&gt; Lemonfingers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>proposal: harry potter and the Leaky Cauldron fan site</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/109</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Confession: I like Harry Potter. (*Gasp!*) I am also very interested in the global phenomenon of Harry--everything from the books, to movies, video games, and fan fic novels, and fan art . . . this exemplifies a bleed between media forms that is more pervasive than perhaps anything before. Is this how a struggling writer, J.K. Rowling, has managed to become the first billionaire author . . . ever? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to do my project on one of the many fan websites devoted to all things HP, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/&quot;&gt;The Leaky Cauldron.&lt;/a&gt; I will examine how the information it presents and the feedback from fans posted on this site play out many of the ideas we&#039;ve read about and discussed in class . . . hypertext, the Memex (especially the user&#039;s in-putting ability), global village, text design and purpose, blogging, Wiki technology,  and incorporation of new new media (AJAX, new programming skills that allow for faster and easier user interfaces), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>proposal</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/103</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;How about this; formally tackling the question of&lt;br /&gt;
a) is the internet really hypertext (comparing the internet&#039;s exploitation of hypertext ideas to classical models)&lt;br /&gt;
and&lt;br /&gt;
b) how does the internet, as the largest and most significant (in the sense of talked about by a large number of people and having a drastic influence on culture) hypertext work to date compare to previous ideas of the superlative work in text and visual art (&quot;the great american novel&quot;, &quot;a masterpeice of the __ era&quot; etc.) ?  Part b begs, I was thinking, an analysis of criticism methodology for new media, specifically in this case hypertext so that means I can cite readings and critical articles and stuffz.&lt;/p&gt;
