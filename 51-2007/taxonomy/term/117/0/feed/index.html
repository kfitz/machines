 <title>Project proposal</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/179</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My project proposal is to play with the idea of a new media kind of thing that&#039;s heavily image based and nonlinear.  Basically I want to try making a hyperfilm.  The idea of translating film into the new media world is a really interesting one to me and I&#039;ve been kind of thinking about how one might go about doing this for a little while now.  While I&#039;m not entirely confident as to the best way to make a truly &quot;hyper&quot; image medium, I&#039;m willing to take a little preliminary stab at it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our reading, I&#039;ve seen film described in one place as the last surviving form of linear narrative, and I think this is fair.  Film is steeped in past storytelling methods and, just like regular print, it is highly linear.  The viewer&#039;s experience is heavily dependent on the organization of the material, and the principles of linear organization apply here in a very real way.  The sequence of the elements of the story play a key role in determining their meaning and filmmakers, whether on a conscious level or not, and the structure of the piece emerges as the linear sequencing of the encounter between the viewer and the elements of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Term Project Proposal, the proposal of poetry</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/176</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, since the beginning of my Creative Writing class this semester (Poetry) my professor has insisted, repeated over and over how we don&#039;t read enough poets, and how we need to read more poets. He is quite right, and I haven&#039;t followed up on this; I don&#039;t like reading poetry, honestly, I can write it, and even when I write it, I don&#039;t feel it is TRUE poetry. So, as my proposal, I want to do some sort of hypertext tree of poetry. It&#039;ll  consist of pieces of different poets that don&#039;t speak the same language --translations provided-- are from the same country, or lived during the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Project Proposal: Google Earth</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/168</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I intend to focus my critical project on the technology of &quot;Google Earth.&quot;  For those who are unfamiliar with this, Google Earth is one of the more recently developed aspects of Google, where a search engine of maps, satellite imagery, and three-dimensional buildings and geographic locations can be present.  As the site&#039;s homepage acknowledges, you can: &quot;Fly to your house. Just type in an address, press search, and you&#039;ll zoom right in.  Search for schools, parks, restaurants, and hotels. Get driving directions, tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose to research and provide a detailed analysis of the functions that Google Earth offers, in addition to the companies and people in particular that benefit from the site.  I hope to discover the positive and negative elements to this form of technology, as well as the people and places most likely affected.  Above all, I will question the existence of Google Earth -- how our society as a whole may or may not benefit from this form of technology, and whether the program is an invasion of privacy for many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
