 <title>mac vs. pc</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net.51-2007/node/251</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the post below that mentions SpyBots, I thought I should bring up the issue of Mac vs. PC. I think it would be interesting to take a poll to see who&#039;s a Mac lover and who adores their PC (well ok, maybe you won&#039;t fall into these categories, but we&#039;ll see . . .)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized how big the divide between Mac and PC is when my friend returned from IT&#039;S the other night (after her PC was malfunctioning) and they told her she had 300 SpyBots on it. I reacted in a shocked way, (because she was flabbergasted) but quite honestly, I have no clue whatsoever what a SpyBots is. Additionally, I think I made a fool of myself the other day in class when I didn&#039;t even know how to eject my thumb drive from the classroom PC after I presented. I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is, I&#039;m a Mac girl, through and through (even after mine died the other night).&lt;/p&gt;
