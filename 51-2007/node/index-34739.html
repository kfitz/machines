So I posted a link in my blog to our class blog as a reply to her comment, and now thanks to my LiveJournal she's probably reading our syllabus on this site.  And reading our blogs about blogging thanks to the link she got from a blog... and reading this post about the scenario.  Now there's some meta for ya...!</p>

The idea that an internet entry created and edited by "hobbyists, teenagers, and even the occassional troll" has as much legitimacy as one written by a scholar completely boggles my mind. Perhaps students' fears about O-Chem could be mitigated if professors assigned reading from Wikipedia...</p>
<p>The fact that many people on Wikipedia are very devoted to this issue of quality intrigues me. I believe (this could be a misconception) that anyone obsessed with the Internet is socially awkward, has way too much time, never spends much time outside, and values knowledge that most people would consider unimportant or trivial. The person that comes to mind is the <a href="http://cbg.nohomers.net" />Comic Book Guy</a> from The Simpsons.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Reading the homework assigned to us the last night made me think about my own blogging experiences. First of all, I never knew that blogs began from simple weblogs of people finding interesting sites. I assumed it was something more personal, like the MySpace blogs. I have only seen or heard of representations of blogs in which there were of the personal nature. I even have a MySpace blog that I use for the personal and to keep in touch with people that I do not get the chance to talk to all that often. It is almost a way to keep up-to-date with the going-ons of people you can't normally keep up with.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I haven't seen anyone mention them here, but photoblogs are worth addressing. Amateur and professional photographers alike post their own images, and many do so daily. They link to their favorite photos of the day from other photobloggers, just as written-word bloggers link to one another. This network levels the playing field of photographers, granting an amateur the same amount of web real estate as a well-connected professional.</p>
<p>The web is the perfect medium for photography because it is otherwise difficult for a photographer to publish his work. A working photographer could open a gallery exhibition, but then the audience is very limited. He/She could publish a book of photos, but they are expensive and do not sell very well unless the photographer is already well-known. Having photography published in a national publication (eg. National Geographic) is one of the most competitive gigs in <em>any</em> industry and is unattainable for most. The photoblog is the perfect answer.</p>

If you didn't have one, or didn't check those of others, chances were you wouldn't have a clue what half the conversations in the classroom were about the next day.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm a relatively private sort of person; so the contrast between the anonymity offered by the internet and blogs, that gives one the freedom to post fairly intimate details that one might not share in other environments, and the idea that these details could be pored over by just about any ol' stranger is interesting to me.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>If asked what a "blog" was during my younger years of high school, I would have answered with an uncertain reference to political forums for "older" people such as my parents, dedicated readers of The Huffington Post.  When my peers (and in turn, myself) discovered such blogging phenomenons as livejournal and myspace, as mentioned in many of the other blogs on our class site, I was first taken aback by how intrusive it seemed to have such open information on the internet at the public's disposal.  What I learned from reading my more blog-savvy friends' entries is that blogs are actually sometimes better used to <em>disguise</em> personal information and thoughts because they allow the writer to identify with <em>anything</em>.  The openness and even anonymity of blogs are opportunitites to present ourselves exactly how we choose with the option to add, omit, embellish, or censor our characters and lifestyles. Many blogs are even tailored to the reception of comments and responses, and writers keep their readers in mind when deciding what to include or not. Blogs warrant attention, controversy, sympathy, or any other response solicitated by their writers.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>It had never thought about how much of the information on the internet comes in blog form. In fact, it wasn't until recently that I realized that I sometimes rely on blogs more than I had previously thought. Although I've never been much of a blog writer and don't read anyone's blog regularly (besides those belonging to friends on Myspace), I often times read reviews for products on blogs. Realizing this led me to thinking about how frequently blogs on the internet are used as a reference or guidance when shopping around from anything ranging from books to iPods. It also made me wonder if marketers and companies pay attention to what bloggers have to say.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>First of all John Barger screams winning documentary short to me; someone in Chicago is looking at a Sundance slot for sure if they make it well.  I'd certainly watch it; he's a fascinating person whose life seems a little off kilter, and as Dibbel has already demonstrated, he's a great jumping off point to examine not only blogging but the larger issue of how interaction with an enormous compendium of data and thus abstraction affect the human condition.  </p>
<p>       It took me a little bit of time to figure out why anyone really cared about the whole blogging phenomenon.  In a world where subcultures full of rite and ritual rise and fade into obscurity every few months without most of the world ever knowing, it is impossible to avoid looking upon anything new and supposedly "important" in the internet world without something of a jaundiced eye.  Blogs, sure, seem to be making waves, and we seem to all interact with them frequently.  But even if Blogging in itself hasn't yet had the impact upon our society that something like television or the atom bomb has for whatever reason, it is nonetheless a point of solid ground from which to start exploring larger issues of human interaction in the age of the mature internet.  That's kind of how I feel about it right now; maybe later I'll see the light and realize just how ridiculously important the rise of blogging is, but at this point I'm much more interested in the larger ideas/movements from which blogging stems, and of which it is a result.</p>

I don't read blogs, so I had to search for one that would be amusing for this one blog that I am currently typing out. I don't recall what this blog- which I am currently going to start describing- was really about, but it has some music content. I do recall that-the blog whose link I will be posting soon- has writing pieces about interesting musicians of whom I have never heard, and it also includes bands like Kasabian and artists like Prince. The writers seem to take music seriously and manage to create posts not to the level of a music journalist, but as close as possible in the most colloquial manner. The critical analysis of the music is interesting because of its content of references to well known artists. The blog also manages to have videos or links to actual songs. I tried a link to a song, but it didn't work within ten seconds so I decided to keep on reading the blog instead and closed the page where the song was to appear. So, here is the link to an interesting <a href="http://buddyhead.typepad.com/medication/"> music blog </a>.</p>
