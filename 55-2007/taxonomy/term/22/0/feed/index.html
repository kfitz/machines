 <description>&lt;p&gt;I certainly do the reading and use the companion book...but in and article or in class some scenes are mentioned and I go &quot;wait...when did that happen?&quot; because I did not fully understand what was happening while reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else have this?  It&#039;s really unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Blitz vs The Riviera</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/28</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started reading Gravity&#039;s Rainbow, I instinctively attempted to impose some sort of structure to the narrative as I read. As I continued to read, I gave up on that to a large degree. Since then I&#039;ve really enjoyed just going with the narrative as it flowed from character to character, from reality to fantasy, and back again. I found the style of the first section to be very reminiscent of what is occurring in London: the constant uncertainty and danger of the Blitz being echoed in the quick changes of scene and viewpoint. The second section of the book also reflects the time and place in which it is set. So far, most of the narrative in this part has focused on Slothrop&#039;s time on the Riviera, which at least in regards to the war has been peaceful. This is reflected in the style of the section, which is a bit slower paced and doesn&#039;t tend to jump around as much. I found some of the scenes to be a bit more &quot;light-hearted:&quot; the beginning of the scene on the beach, the mock fight with the seltzer and brandy, the toga chase, and Slothrop&#039;s drinking game. I&#039;m really looking forward to seeing how things progress, especially as Slothrop becomes both more paranoid, and more aware of what is going on around him.&lt;/p&gt;
