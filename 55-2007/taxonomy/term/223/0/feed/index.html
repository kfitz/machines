 <title>Gately&#039;s dreams</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/264</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gately keeps having these dreams, or rather, nightmares, about Orientals (begins on page 809) while he&#039;s lying in the hospital bed.  In his dream he is robbing an Oriental man and he tries to blindfold him using twine (which is clearly too thin) and so the Oriental keeps looking back at him, &quot;blink inscrutably.&quot;  When I read this I kept thinking, &quot;Why is he using twine?&quot; but that maybe it was supposed to be because Gately had the idea that Asian eyes were so small that they could be covered with twine.  He also mentions that the Oriental was wearing &quot;a silk robe and scary sandals, and had no hair on its legs.&quot;  First of all, why is the Oriental sexless?  Why does Gately use the word &quot;it&quot; to describe the Oriental?  I guess the biggest question I have is why is Gately apparently so afraid of Asians?    I thought maybe it was supposed to represent the pervasive ethnocentricity that Americans believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
