 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve noticed Slothrop undergoing some interesting character changes as we&#039;ve continued.  (Note: I&#039;m not referring to the reading for today, which I haven&#039;t yet begun.  Go go speed reading!)  When we first meet him, he doesn&#039;t really seem emotionally connected to anyone; though he definitely has his share of human interactions, they don&#039;t seem to mean anything to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That starts changing when he gets to the Riviera, specifically once people start leaving him.  He pines after Katje, and his anger over Tantivy&#039;s death drives him out of France.  He starts to realize this change when he says goodbye to Geli: &quot;It is taking him longer, the longer he&#039;s in the Zone, to remember to say aw quit being a sap.  What is this place doing to his brain?&quot; (338)  He sticks with Margherita, despite being frightened by her obvious batshit insanity, and gets immediately and deeply attached to Bianca.&lt;/p&gt;
