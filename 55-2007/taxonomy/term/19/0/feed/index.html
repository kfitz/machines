 <title>Angels</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/25</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like angels have been showing up a lot in the reading lately.  To date, two female characters have been connected with angels- Franz imagines his wife, Leni PÃ¶kler, as having wings that will take him away, and Katje is also described as having wing-like shoulder blades.  In one of the sections on Blicero, he thinks of Rilke&#039;s Tenth Elegy, which has an Angel in it.  There are a multitude of smaller references to angels, as in the carol that the children sing at Christmas, (hark the herald angel sing...) and in the scene where Katje is being photographed, and there is a reference to a certain type of mushroom that is called after an angel.  Finally, there is the Angel that appears during an air raid over the city of LÃ¼beck (p.153-154).&lt;/p&gt;
