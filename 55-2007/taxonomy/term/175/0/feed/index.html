 <title>SURPRISE! IT&#039;S A BABY!</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I read about Mario&#039;s birth, I was a little disturbed.  &quot;He had to be more or less scraped out, Mario, like the meat of an oyster from a womb to whose sides he&#039;d been found spiderishly clinging...(313)&quot;  The description of scraping him out of a womb sounds like an abortion, and it makes him seem like some unwanted parasite.  It&#039;s strange that he survived such a traumatic birth, and in some ways, maybe it can be interpreted that part of him did die?  His eyes have an odd dead gray-green color to them, and his scalp is the same color.  I envisioned a semi-decaying body...(is that morbid?)  Anyway a question I had, is Mario James&#039; son or Charles&#039;?  His hair is likened to that of the &quot;athletic director and Academy Headmaster,&quot; (314) and it flaps up in the same way Charles&#039; hair does.&lt;/p&gt;
