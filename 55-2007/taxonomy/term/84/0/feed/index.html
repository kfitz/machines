 <title>Slothrop&#039;s Mom and Pop, and Other Explorations...</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/89</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I&#039;m sure some of it went over my head, I was particularly fond of the long chapter in section 4 that was broken down into short snippets of moments and stories. This section is near the end of the novel (in the 700&#039;s pages) and I feel that it opens up some new ideas while pulling others together (especially regarding Slothrop). I&#039;m just going to talk about a few of the sections I thought were interesting and see what you guys think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few of these sections dealt with Slothrop, specifically his childhood and his family. One section, called &quot;Mom Slothrop&#039;s Letter to Embassador Kennedy&quot; was particularly interesting to me because it&#039;s essentially a letter where Slothrop&#039;s mother self-consciously expresses her serious concern for little Tyrone. She came off as an intensely depressed woman who drowns her sorrows in a falsely cheery demeanor and one too many martini&#039;s. She begins the letter very playfully, but says she feels like &quot;they&#039;re pieces of the Heavenly City falling down.&quot; She says &quot;Sometimes things aren&#039;t very clear [...] in my heart I kep getting this terrible fear, this empty place, and it&#039;s very hard at times to really belive in a Plan with a shape bigger than I can see&quot; (682 in my book). Perhaps she feels regret and confusion about the things Tyrone is being subjected to, but is grappling with the people who tell her that it is necessary. I think this highlights the plight of multiple characters in this book who are working towards a cause they don&#039;t fully understand, or are driven by anonymous powers and forces.&lt;/p&gt;
