 <title>Final Thoughts</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/192</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Some final thoughts about Underworld. It was certainly a more enjoyable book than Gravity&#039;s Rainbow if only for the fact that it was much easier to read. The thing that really struck my about Underworld though was being able to see people&#039;s thoughts. I felt the thought processes and logic of each of the characters was something very unique. They each embodied a particular method of thinking. But unlike Gravity&#039;s Rainbow, their thoughts were coherent. Perhaps a little extreme, but logically in its own way none the less. I could actually connect and relate to their thoughts as opposed to the absurd paranoia of the characters in Gravities rainbow. And I would be lying to say that I have attempted to adopt some of their paradigms when it comes to seeing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
