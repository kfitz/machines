 <description>&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning of this section Poor Tony Krause is withdrawing from heroin and also the grain alcohol that was in the cough medicine he was drinking. Wallace ties Tony directly in with time, which I thought was kinda cool. The excruciating agony that he was going through was extended and Tony&#039;s perception of time was completed distorted.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Time began to take on new aspects for him, now, as Withdrawl progressed. Time began to pass with sharp edges. Its passage in the dark or dimlit stall was like time was being carried by a procession of ants...Byt the second week in the stall time itself seemed the corridor, lightless at either end...after more time time then ceased to move or be moved&quot; (302)&lt;/p&gt;
