 <title>Gender in Infinite Jest</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve been here before, with the other novels, especially GR, and I&#039;d like to revisit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read this book, the vast majority of the characters are male and even in the relatively major female characters I never really sensed much of what would be considered conventional femininity. We&#039;ve encountered the USSMK, Ann Kittenplan who&#039;s about as feminine as the East German women&#039;s swim team, Avril, the Incandenzas&#039; mother but also for the most part serves both the role of mother and father, Kate Gompert who&#039;s nothing but horridly depressed and finally Joelle who we see mostly as the &quot;pretty girl&quot; and not particularly feminine. At the same time, Infinite Jest IV or V tells its viewer, &quot;Death is always female and that the female is always maternal. I.e. that the woman who kills you is always your next life&#039;s mother&quot; (788). Why such a strong focus on death as female? Why is this what people want to hear? that their mothers are &quot;SO VERY SORRY&quot; (839)? Or more puzzling why can Jim Incandenza alone endure the film?&lt;/p&gt;
