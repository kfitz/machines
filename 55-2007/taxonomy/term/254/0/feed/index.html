 <description>&lt;p&gt;We were talking today in class about the way that the book portrays everything as some type of code.   There is the way that we percieve people, which Enoch Root theorizes is not who that person actually is but rather who we have catalogued that person as.  Lawrence imagined that there were people across the ocean who were reading the waves of the ocean that had changed due to footprints he&#039;d made in the sand.  On page 670, Randy uses the phrase, &quot;The most cigarettes&quot; which meas nothing to other people, but to Avi and Randy, who understand it, it is a shortened version of the phrase, &quot;We could end up in prison married to the guy with the most cigarettes.&quot;  I really liked this use of code because Randy and Doug use predetermined words that they use to stand for other things, but we rarely see our everyday conversation as a type of code.&lt;/p&gt;
