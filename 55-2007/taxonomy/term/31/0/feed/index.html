 <title>in response to the recent discussion of the masculine</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;This was going to be a comment....but it&#039;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fellow senior English major here at Pomona is actually writing his thesis on the feminine in Gravity&#039;s Rainbow (and one other book).  I was very surprised to find that out, as I thought the masculine would be the obvious choice.  We&#039;ve got how many characters at this point, and something like two of them are women?  Anyway, I realized, while contemplating this guy&#039;s choice, that their role in the novel is actually a lot more powerful than we are giving them credit for.  I&#039;m pretty sure Katje is a major power player, or at least was in her past.&lt;/p&gt;
