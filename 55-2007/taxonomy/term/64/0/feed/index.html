 <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree (with surgiomcsurgexc) that sometimes Pynchon seems to be criticizing American&#039;s through Slothrop.  Similarly, I wondered what Pynchon was trying to say about the Japanese.  A couple pages after the quote you cited, there is also one about a Japanese man: &quot;He does notice that the only person not connected...seemed to be the Jap liaison man, who&#039;s been sitting alone, one deck up, watching.  Not masturbating or anything, just watching, watching the river, the night...well, they&#039;re pretty inscrutable, you know, those Japs.&quot; (475)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting that this Japanese man was not included in the mass audience arousal, especially when I thought about it in relation to WWII and Japan&#039;s history of violence, rape, and brutality during the war.  The Japanese invasion of China was accompanied by atrocious acts against the Chinese people.  Men were tortured and killed, but women were tortured, raped, mutilated beyond recognition, and then either left to suffer alive (humiliated, with their honor ripped away) or killed, as well.  In my history seminar last semester, we discussed the Japanese culture/society and how it was very rigid and structured, which may be one of the reasons why so many Japanese soldiers, when exposed to the war environment, became so ruthless and insensitive.  This, I feel, not only relates to how war affects people (which someone else has already mentioned in their blog about the children), but also why this &quot;Jap liaison man&quot; may be so unaffected by the hyper-crazy-group-sex scene.  (Keep in mind, I think it relates, but I don&#039;t really know how or to what extent.)&lt;/p&gt;
