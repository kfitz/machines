 <description>&lt;p&gt;A-and we&#039;re done. Hrmm. As i&#039;m merely positing theories and the like, the following should be taken with a grain or two of salt (though i&#039;ve never actually figured out what that means [either]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Zero. It&#039;s the title of the first section of the novel, and naturally should bear some importance. There&#039;s Absolute Zero, the point at which there is a complete lack of molecular motion, a complete and utter lack of &quot;progress&quot; that everyone (who? Them?) seems to be gunning for.  But what is this Absolute Zero? Or Zero, for that matter... Well, i&#039;ve some ideas on the notion of Absolute Zero being implemented as maybe some kind of maintenance of the &quot;status quo&quot; (which in turn leads me down a slippery slope on the nature of Bureaucracy, who&#039;s actually in charge of what, effective leadership through the obscurity of, etc) but as I haven&#039;t really figured that out yet i&#039;ll file that in the &quot;Maybe&quot; pile. On to the Zero...The OED defines Zero as the arithmetical figure which denotes &quot;nought.&quot; So, zero means nothing, fair enough. But what exactly is &quot;Beyond&quot; nothing? Well....&lt;/p&gt;
