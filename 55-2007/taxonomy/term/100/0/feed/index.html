 <title>A little taunting never hurt anyone right...?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/106</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One part of the book that really struck me was when Bill and Cotter are fighting over the ball and Cotter slowly walks backwards to taunt Bill. &quot;He holds the ball chest-high and turns it in his fingers, which isn&#039;t easy when you&#039;re running..The maneuver makes Bill slow down. He looks at Cotter backpedaling, doing a danceman&#039;s strut, but he doesn&#039;t detect an opening here. Because the maneuver makes him realize where he is. The fact that Cotter&#039;s not scared.&quot; (57)&lt;br /&gt;
And is not this how the cold war was fought. Like Cotter and Bill here, the US and the Soviet Union always had to one up each other (arms race) and show the other side they were not scared to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
