 <title>Life and Death</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/102</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, this book is so much easier to read than Gravity&#039;s Rainbow! I really liked the prologue (I think part of that is because I actually understood everything that I was reading!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One incident that I found particularly interesting was on page 41: &quot;in the box seats J. Edgar Hoover plucks a magazine page off his shoulder, where the thing has lighted and stuck. At first he&#039;s annoyed that the object has come in contact with his body. Then his eyes fall upon the page. It is a color reproduction of a painting crowded with medieval figures who are dying or dead--a landscape of visionary havoc and ruin. Edgar has never seen a painting quite like this. It covers the page completely and must surely dominate the magazine . . . it is clear to Edgar that the page is from Life and he tries to work up an anger, he asks himself why a magazine called Life would want to produce a painting of such lurid and dreadful dimensions. But he can&#039;t take his eyes off the page.&quot; (Sorry for including that long of an excerpt!)&lt;/p&gt;
