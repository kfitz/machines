 <title>HoD reference?/Close reading of a passage</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/93</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;With his crank here young Paddy is practicing another form of Eddie&#039;s gift, though he&#039;s transmitting not receiving.  The bulb appears to burn steadily, but this is really a succession of electric peaks and valleys, passing by at a speed that depends on how fast paddy is cranking.  It&#039;s only that the wire inside the bulb unbrightens slow enough before the next peak shows up that fools us into seeing a steady light.  It&#039;s really a train of imperceptible light and dark.  Usually imperceptible.  The message is never conscious on Paddy&#039;s part.&quot; (654) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage really reminded me of Conrad&#039;s Heart of Darkness.  I don&#039;t know if Pynchon was in any way influenced by that novella, but here&#039;s why I think he was.  One of the major motifs in HoD is darkness and light.  Traditionally thinking equates light with enlightenment/civilization and darkness with savageness/primitivism.  The bulb that Paddy is cranking is not actually burning steadily, but only appears so because of the rapid bursts of light.  Likewise in HoD, Marlow says, &quot;We live in the flicker,&quot; which is &quot;like a flash of lightning.&quot; (48 of the Barnes and Noble edition I own.)  I think it&#039;s interesting that Pynchon writes that we are fooled into seeing a steady light.  In HoD, ultimately, it can be determined that civilization itself, with its acts of violence (aka colonization, which is a theme present in both books), is savage.  There is an inversion of light and dark at the end, when readers are led into the heart of an immense darkness in London, not the Congo.  Relating this back to Pynchon&#039;s GR, this passage therefore seems to assert what Conrad wrote in his work:  Europeans/white men who carry the burden to civilize others blindly follow the belief that they are improving the world and perpetuating civilization; however, what they believe to be enlightened thoughts and actions are also (imperceptibly) dark and savage.&lt;/p&gt;
