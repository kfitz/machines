 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, can someone please explain the last scene with Orin and Luria P--- that starts on 971?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the ending, as someone has already mentioned in their blog, it is definitely not a very cheery scene.  I&#039;m not very surprised that the ending wasn&#039;t anything more conclusive or uplifting, because, quite frankly, this book was just depressing.  It had its moments of ludicrous hilarity, but overall, I just felt really bad for a lot of, if not all of, the characters.  Everyone is so emotionally messed up that they deserve a hug...or maybe not (if you remember that scene with Ken Erdedy and Poor Tony that starts on 503).  It&#039;s fitting that the ending matches the criticism what people expect out of entertainment.  We want something that is wrapped up neatly at the end and leaves us with warm, fuzzy feelings; instead, we get relapse and a feeling that nothing changed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
