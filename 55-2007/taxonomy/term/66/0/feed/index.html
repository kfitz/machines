 <title>Parallels between Greta/Bianca, Leni/Ilse</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/72</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed in class that the handout talked about the parallels between Ilse and Bianca. I thought this was very interesting because I actually had difficulty telling the two different stories apart at first. For a while, I thought that Greta was Leni under a different name, and if you think it about it, that notion was not too far-fetched at the time! Besides the obvious, (that the women have young, overly mature and promiscuious daughters who have very inappropriate, intimate sex with older men with strange fantasies), there are many parallels drawn between Greta and Leni (or their daughters) in this book. Also, Greta was essentially a porn star and Leni has transformed into the prostitute &quot;Solange&quot;. There is also that weird conception coincedence as Slothrop muses, &quot;Ilse,  fathered on Greta&#039;s silver and passive image, Bianca, conceived during the filming of the very scene that was in his thoughts as Pokler pumped in the fatal charge of sperm-- how could they not be the same child&quot; (586)? This is an important question. Why are there these coincedences? Why were they fathered with the same image in mind? Why are they both young, sexually-charged female characters with clear father complexes? Why are the sex scenes with both of these characters so powerful to both partners? In the past, Slothrop has inseminated and then moved on. After his brief moment of passion with Bianca, he cannot get her from his mind for the rest of the reading!! Pokler, though clearly overwrought dealing with paranoia and his issues of being a parent, seems to be strangely fulfilled after his sex with his daughter. Why does Pynchon make these girls so oddly similar and so terribly captivating?&lt;/p&gt;
