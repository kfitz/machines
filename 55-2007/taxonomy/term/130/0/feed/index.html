 <title>Apparently you don&#039;t just &quot;get it&quot;</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting around page 600, when Marian is listening to the radio about the protests, it repeatedly says, &quot;She began to understand this was Vietnam Week on campuses... She began to understand that the riot out there, if that&#039;s what it was, was being...She began to understand that someone or some group had taken over the radio and as they day...&quot; (599-603). I don&#039;t know if she has been thinking like this before but I didn&#039;t notice it until now. It just really strikes me that DeLillo would use &quot;she began to understand...&quot; and not &quot;she understood&quot;. All the things she is &quot;beginning to understand&quot; are pretty straightforward facts. You either understand  that its a riot, or not. You either understand that the radio has been hijacked or not. There is no in between process of understanding. Somehow though, I have a feeling DeLillo wasn&#039;t trying to make Marian slow or something...&lt;/p&gt;
