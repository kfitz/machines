 <title>The future of media</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/239</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While frantically attempting to write my proposal, reread Underworld and read Infinite Jest I&#039;ve been obsessing over the role of media in the encyclopedic novel.  These novels have all been so conscious of their...novel-ness...and are in such rebellion to it.  From GR to U to IJ we&#039;ve seen books trying to be something other than books, such as movies, or radio, or maybe waste, maybe even dreams or imagination (parts of GR especially).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&#039;t have much point in this post, and am not saying anything interesting or new, I&#039;ve been thinking so much about what they are all trying to say about the future of media and in particular the future of the novel.  We are already witnessing the decline of traditional news media and the rise of more independent, readily accessible media.  The media in IJ is particularly interesting in the way it plays such a large part in the characters lives and becomes as much an addiction as any of the others in the novel.  The prophesies of Delillo and Pynchon were so on in many ways, I wonder what Wallace really sees as the future of media...&lt;/p&gt;
