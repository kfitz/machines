 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this is just a random thing I noticed.  In my Victorian/Gothic Lit class, a lot of what my prof explains about the time period and the development of the Gothic novel really seems to have been carried through to the post-Modernist period and many of the themes, such as personal history and an obsession with the past, are still prevalent in encyclopedic narratives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to read about the Victorian frame of mind on the subject of love, sex, and women, and this quote from Infinite Jest really reminded me of what I had read.  &quot;We want choice.  A sense of efficaciousness and choice.  To be loved by someone.  To freely love who you happen to love&quot; (423).  Some Victorians believed that the institute of marriage was a negative influence on society because marriages that were the product of socio-economical incentives only increased the number of extramarital affairs.  This is why many were beginning to support marriages of love.  Marathe&#039;s take on the American ideal of &quot;Pride in your work and family, and home&quot; is also a very Victorian trait (423).&lt;/p&gt;
