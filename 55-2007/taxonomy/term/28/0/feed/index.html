 <title>Why does Pointsman Pull Pudding&#039;s Strings?</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/34</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate to bring up this section of the book again, since it did include some very obscene descriptions of bodily functions, but I am a bit confused about one part of it. I understand that Domina Nocturna is Katje, and that this is all some cruel set up of Pointsman&#039;s, but why? Why did Ernest Pudding have to undergo all of these tests? He clearly knew they were tests and he didn&#039;t seem surprised, but I am still foggy about it. Why did he go from cell to cell, being tested by Pointsman? Is Pointsman the mastermind? Is he the one dictating the Slothrop following and spying and basically every scheme in this book? If anyone could clear up my thinking, I would be much obliged.&lt;/p&gt;
