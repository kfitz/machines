 <title>Watt&#039;s Tower</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/171</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the multiple references to Watt&#039;s Tower in Underworld. I meant to write about this earlier, but haven&#039;t had a chance. Both Klara and Nick (I think) are entranced by the building- a structure built of waste. Wikipedia says its &quot;non-traditional vernacular architecture&quot; built primarily of steel, wire mesh and mortar. However, &quot;found objects&quot; cover the buildings:  bed frames, bottles, ceramic tiles, scrap metal and sea shells.&lt;br /&gt;
The idea that trash can be compiled into a piece of art is baffling in the beginning, but then Klara herself turns to that idea- that we can save the waste and put it on clean museum walls and it becomes beautiful. Nick is reminded of his father as he strolls through Watts Towers &quot;The work he (Rodia- the architect) did is a kind of swilring free-souled noise, a jazz cathedral, and the power of the thing, for me, the deep disturbance, was that my own ghost father was living in the walls.&quot; Good art stirs emotions- everyone knows that, but when you take stuff no one else wants and turn it into something that speaks- that&#039;s impressive. Nick&#039;s job is centered around boxing up waste and hiding it from the world- whereas Rodia and Klara find the most boring trash and turn it into art.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Bill Waterson</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/125</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been tossing this name around in my head since it sounded so familiar, so I turned to everyone&#039;s best friend, Wikipedia. Bill Watterson (with two T&#039;s) was the author of Calvin and Hobbes comic strips, as I suspected. He was also born in 1958, so clearly not at the baseball game. I was just trying to think of who it could be and thought I&#039;d share...&lt;/p&gt;
