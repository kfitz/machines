 <title>Lor d of the Flies, Pigs, and Zits</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/75</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I read the section where Slothrop dresses up like a pig, I immediately thought of Golding&#039;s Lord of the Flies.  I don&#039;t know if Pynchon meant to allude to that book, but it&#039;s just something that I happened to take notice of.  Slothrop, I felt, represented that little fat kid, Piggy, from Lord of the Flies.  The children &quot;prod his stomach,&quot; declare him the &quot;fattest man in the world,&quot; and ultimately ask him to wear a pig costume (578).  I was half expecting them to hunt him down and stick his head on a pole or something!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section also made me wonder, &quot;Why a PIG?&quot;  I don&#039;t have a companion, so I don&#039;t know if this is already something that is explained, but it just struck me as odd that Pynchon would go pig-crazy.  The talking female pig that grows more and more attractive in Slothrop&#039;s eyes was entertaining in a weird beastiality kind of way...&lt;/p&gt;
