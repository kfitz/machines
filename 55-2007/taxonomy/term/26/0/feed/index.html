 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought it was really interesting how DeLillo explicity connects Sister Edgar and J. Edgar Hoover as &quot;Sister and Brother. A fantasy in cyberspace and a way of seeing the other side and a settling of differences that have less to do with gender than with difference itself, all argument, all conflict programmed out.&quot; Both characters exist in insular worlds without outside contact, yet cyberspace ultimately links them together albeit as only a &quot;single fluctuating impulse now, a piece of coded information&quot; (826). I&#039;m not entirely sure as to what DeLillo means, but the ending seems very ambivalent, maybe intentionally so in order to mirror the increasing lack of a divide between what he calls cyberspace and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Final Word</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/175</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So.... we&#039;ve finished, and I&#039;ve arrived at what I assume is a clichÃ© question for this novel: Why is the last word &quot;Peace&quot; (827)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the novel has been deconstructing the Cold War, and the physical and psychological destruction it caused despite being &quot;cold&quot; (ex: the children with deformities, the nuclear waste, the fear and paranoia). So does the word represent Dellilo&#039;s plea? His wish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick himself seems to have settled into some form of acceptance with himself and his life, but he says: &quot;I long for the days of disorder. I want them back, the days when I was alive on the earth, rippling in the quick of my skin, heedless and real. I was dumb-muscled and angry and real. This is what I long for, the breach of peace, the days of disarray when I walked the real streets and did things slap-bang and felt angry and ready all the time, a danger to others and a distant mystery to myself&quot; (810). Nick does not long for peace, but for the days of his irrational youthful anger and readiness for violence. Perhaps he is a victim of the Cold War era, then, and can never exist happily in a world of peace. He was a child of the Cold War, and his identity was constructed on that mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Moments of Peace in War</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/30</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On page 172, just after Pointsmen has recieved oral sex from Maud, it says, &quot;But no one saw them, then or ever, and in the winter ahead, here and there, her look will cross his and she&#039;ll begin to blush red as her knees, she&#039;ll come to his room off the loab once or twice perhaps, but somehow they&#039;re never to have this again, this sudden tropics in the held breath of war and English December, this moment of perfect peace.&quot;  Typically oral sex is not seen as an act of emotional intimacy, but rather as an erotic sexual act.  I think it&#039;s interesting that Pynchon has chosen this as the perfect moment of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
