 <title>Ghosts and Windows</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/55-2007/node/248</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m not sure if I even knew this was possible, but Ortho Stice got his forehead stuck to a window. This scene (865- 876ish) was hilarious, but I&#039;m also not entirely sure I get the significance of it (although maybe the significance has yet to come by page 900?). Throughout all of Hal&#039;s plotting to get Stice loose (&quot;Dark, prepare yourself mentally&quot; (870)), Stice is speculating about paranormal matters. I thought it was interesting how a.) Stice seems more concerned about ghosts and stuff than about having his forehead stuck to a window and b.) that neither Hal nor Stice immediately refutes the idea that there may be paranormal &quot;things&quot; in the ETA. Hal says that &quot;Mario says he&#039;s seen paranormal figures, and he&#039;s not kidding, and Mario doesn&#039;t lie . . . so belief-wise I don&#039;t know what to think. Subhadronic particles behave ghostishly. I think I withhold all prejudgment on the whole thing&quot; (871). So obviously there&#039;s been some speculation on the matter, and even Hal has a hard time refuting the fact that there may be paranormal things floating around the ETA.&lt;/p&gt;
