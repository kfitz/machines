On page 409,<br />
"...he [Mondaugen] seemed to look at fuel and oxidizer as paired opposites, male and female principles uniting in the mystical egg of the combustion chamber: creation and destruction, fire and water, chemical plus and chemical minus--."<br />
"Valency," Pokler protested, "a condition of the outer shells, that's all."</p>
<p>Then on page 572 Andreas explains the importance of the mandala to Slothrop.  It's a long paragraph so I won't type it all out, but basically there are two types of the letters on the mandala, male and female letters representing different directions.  This came from the way that in their tribal villages, women and men lived on opposite sides of the village.  The female letters represent fertilization, birth, breath, and soul, while the male letter represent activities, fire, preparation, and building,  It says, "Each opposite pair of vanes worked together, and amoved in opposite senses.  Opposites together."</p>

(Note: I'm not referring to the reading for today, which I haven't yet begun.  Go go speed reading!)  When we first meet him, he doesn't really seem emotionally connected to anyone; though he definitely has his share of human interactions, they don't seem to mean anything to him.</p>
<p>That starts changing when he gets to the Riviera, specifically once people start leaving him.  He pines after Katje, and his anger over Tantivy's death drives him out of France.  He starts to realize this change when he says goodbye to Geli: "It is taking him longer, the longer he's in the Zone, to remember to say aw quit being a sap.  What is this place doing to his brain?" (338)  He sticks with Margherita, despite being frightened by her obvious batshit insanity, and gets immediately and deeply attached to Bianca.</p>

"I've had her for two years," he sobs, "she's been fine, she's never tried to-- I dont know. Somthing just came over her."<br />
"Quit fooling. Lemmings never do anything alone. They need a crowd. Its gets contagious. You see, Ludwig, they overbreed, it goes in cycles, when ther are too many of them they panic and run off looking for food." </p>
<p>Slothrop finds it very hard to believe that Ludwig's lemmming would be the single lemming to survive the famously cliched mass-suicide of the lemmings.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>This was originally a comment on rose's entry, but it got pretty lengthy, so I decided to go ahead and make it an entry of its own.</p>
<p>The idea of going "beyond the zero" (the title of the first part), seems to be a major theme, but I don't fully understand what this is supposed to mean. I realize that we've talked about this, but since I still don't feel like I really grasp the concept, I decided to list some of the most important zero references that we   have come across so far, with the help of the website roses linked.</p>
<p>The book opens with Pirate's dream: "No, this is not a disentanglement from, but a progressive knotting into--they go under archways...developing through those empty days brilliant and deep, especially at dawn, with blue shadows to seal its passage, to try to bring events to Absolute Zero..."</p>

Pynchon writes, "'...A lion in each of you. He is either tamed-by too much mathematics, by details of design, by corporate procedures-or he stays wild, an eternal predator. The lion does not know subtleties and half-solutions. He does not accept sharing as a basis for anything! He takes, he holds! He is not a Bolshevik or a Jew. You will never hear relativity from the lion. He wants the absolute. Life and death. Win and lose. not truces or arrangements, but the joy of the leap, the roar, the blood.'"(587)</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>When I read the section where Slothrop dresses up like a pig, I immediately thought of Golding's Lord of the Flies.  I don't know if Pynchon meant to allude to that book, but it's just something that I happened to take notice of.  Slothrop, I felt, represented that little fat kid, Piggy, from Lord of the Flies.  The children "prod his stomach," declare him the "fattest man in the world," and ultimately ask him to wear a pig costume (578).  I was half expecting them to hunt him down and stick his head on a pole or something!  </p>
<p>This section also made me wonder, "Why a PIG?"  I don't have a companion, so I don't know if this is already something that is explained, but it just struck me as odd that Pynchon would go pig-crazy.  The talking female pig that grows more and more attractive in Slothrop's eyes was entertaining in a weird beastiality kind of way...</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Overall, the companion is really helpful in reading Gravity's Rainbow.  The basic plot points are there if you get a little lost, which is nice.  But there are definitely parts of this book where I am looking at the plot and wondering "Why?" or "How did that happen?", and most of the time, I can't find the answers to those questions in the companion.  The answers may be in the book itself somewhere, but flipping back through 600 pages to search for a possible explanation of probably trivial actions doesn't really work too well, I've discovered.</p>
<p>So I tried the old Internet approach, looking the book up on Sparknotes and Pinkmonkey, hoping to get some basic things about a couple of episodes that are beyond me solved.  Neither site has this book.  They have everything from the Odyssey to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, but not this.  The only internet summaries I could find that went by episode were all from one source, and simply consisted of quotes from the book...which wasn't helping me in the first place.</p>

<p>There's an important bit about the pigs on page 564-5 that I'm not really exactly sure what to make of in light of Slothrop taking up the pig suit.</p>
<p>Man in the Western World abides by the rules of the system, but in the colonies where he is free from the system, he may follow his natural impulses alone. "Christian Europe was death" (322) in the same way that the text constantly reminds us that the system fueling the war and its aftermath depends on death. To lose sight of death and indulge life in the colonies is to free oneself from that system.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I noticed in class that the handout talked about the parallels between Ilse and Bianca. I thought this was very interesting because I actually had difficulty telling the two different stories apart at first. For a while, I thought that Greta was Leni under a different name, and if you think it about it, that notion was not too far-fetched at the time! Besides the obvious, (that the women have young, overly mature and promiscuious daughters who have very inappropriate, intimate sex with older men with strange fantasies), there are many parallels drawn between Greta and Leni (or their daughters) in this book. Also, Greta was essentially a porn star and Leni has transformed into the prostitute "Solange". There is also that weird conception coincedence as Slothrop muses, "Ilse,  fathered on Greta's silver and passive image, Bianca, conceived during the filming of the very scene that was in his thoughts as Pokler pumped in the fatal charge of sperm-- how could they not be the same child" (586)? This is an important question. Why are there these coincedences? Why were they fathered with the same image in mind? Why are they both young, sexually-charged female characters with clear father complexes? Why are the sex scenes with both of these characters so powerful to both partners? In the past, Slothrop has inseminated and then moved on. After his brief moment of passion with Bianca, he cannot get her from his mind for the rest of the reading!! Pokler, though clearly overwrought dealing with paranoia and his issues of being a parent, seems to be strangely fulfilled after his sex with his daughter. Why does Pynchon make these girls so oddly similar and so terribly captivating?</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I'm going to try out my close reading skills (that I'm not particularly confident about) here with a passage that particularly stuck me in the last section we read:</p>
<p>"Perfume, smoke, alcohol, and sweat glide though the house in turbulences too gentle to feel or see. It's a floating celebration no one's thought to adjourn: a victory party so permanent, so easy at gathering newcomer and old regular to itself, that who can say for sure which victory? which war?"(613). </p>
<p>It's interesting that of the four things that Pynchon mentions at the beginning of this excerpt, perfume and smoke are what I think of as vaporous. I suppose that perfume can be a liquid before sprayed, but in a party setting, I'd consider it a vapor drifting off a woman. Alcohol and sweat are, in "natural" form I suppose, liquids, although both can take on vaporous qualities. All of these things that are gliding through the house are thus mutable. But none of them can be felt or seen-- thus can they be smelled?</p>
