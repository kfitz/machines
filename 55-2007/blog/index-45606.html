</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>This is a bit of a silly post, but it's things like this that are making Infinite Jest infinitely easier to read for me than the other novels. The book is alienating sometimes (Joelle section starting  227) when I don't understand it, but Wallace includes some odd stray thoughts that I've pondered before, thoughts that I never imagined I would see in print. I'd be grateful if someone could tell me what's going on in that 227-235 section though, is she just watching one of James Incandenza's movies?</p>
<p>But back to the odd tidbits, on 221, in the middle of a lengthy description of a city street drenched in rain, Wallace describes the swish of cars driving by: "sheening by with the special lonely sound of cars in rain, wipers making black rainbows on taxis' shining windshields" (221). It was strange to read this because I've always considered cars driving on a rainy day lonely. All the windows stopped up, and sheets of water, glass and metal effectively plug people up in their cars, and the cars from each other. The wiper noises are the cars whining.</p>

<p>"Ewell decides this is what gives profundity to the tattoo-impulse's profound irrevocability: Having a tatt removed means just exchanging one kind of disfigurement for another" (208). </p>
<p>Over and over, DFW reminds us of the permanent affliction of addiction. The rehabilitation and recovery process only helps stave off the further progression of the disease, but can never erase or return affairs to their original proper state. Even more troubling, the battle continues after rehab; the slide back into addiction, like having the state take the children away, is so much easier than managing to keep hold. Moreover as stated on page 201, the addicts remain in permanent want of Substance even after quitting use. There seems to be no "health," only a new disease. Saving one's physical life, does not entirely improve their mental outlook.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I found the scene on pages 255-257ish to be really thought provoking. This is the scene when Orin and Hal are on the phone; Hal is telling Orin about his grief-therapy after he found his father ("Himself") who had comitted suicide by putting his head in a microwave. This scene was kind of sickly-humorous--like when Hal said that his first thought when he had come home that day was that "something smelled delicious!" (256). But it also kind of gave us some insight into Hal, or at least, I thought it did. </p>
<p>It was interesting how Hal went through anger (vented towards the grief-therapist) and then a kind of guilt-denial and then accepted things and then absolved himself, all within one visit to the therapist's office.</p>

<p>When the book was going over some of the things that addicts/mental patients learn during recovery, it kept mentioning a bunch of strategies and lessons patients are taught in order to regain control of their lives. These continous lessons of control reminded me of the strict sports lessons of James's Incandenza's father, which were then taught by James to his son, Hal (especially those regarding controlling your body). I'm drawing closer parallels between mental patients and tennis players as the novel goes on, in their similarly obsessive, struggling, carefully monitored existence.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I tried to read Infinite Jest a couple years back, maybe 2 or 3, and frankly, that's a good part of why I'm enrolled in this class.  Besides being forced to read Gravity's Rainbow, which I knew I needed (or I'd never do it myself).  I probably got about 200 pages in - I can't remember exactly - but I vividly remember dropping the book one time, forgetting my place, and thinking I found it, only realizing after reading TWENTY PAGES that I hadn't reached this section in the least.  I was nearly 50 pages off, in fact.  This led me to decide that you can open this book at any point at all and it will probably make about as much sense as if you had read up to that point.  Now, I realize that Gravity's Rainbow probably would have felt that way had we not talked it out so extensively, and used the companion.  Which is why I'm taking this class, really - so I can have a guided reading through this book that, last time I read it, seemed a jumbled mish mash of plots and fragmented narrative.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Tagged: <ul class="links inline"><li  class="first taxonomy_term_158"><a href="../taxonomy/term/158/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_158">drugs</a></li>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I think the initial "Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment" segment depicting the torturous wait for drugs in the midst of addiction is fascinating when taken in the context of the role drug use played in the other two novels, especially because his mental state comes off as somehow desperately paranoiac, though in a very different way from what we've seen thus far in the course. The idea that something like drug use becomes compulsory, something "he would force himself to do...even if he didn't want it. Even if it started to make him sizzy and ill. He would use discipline and persistence and will and make the whole experience so unpleasant, so debased and debauched and unpleasant, that...he'd never want to do it again" (22). I think this comes off as pathologically alienating because it's so teleological: I'll smoke now so I won't want to / have to smoke later. This mindset undermines the present moment completely, to the extent that we want to say, Look if you're going to smoke, you might as well enjoy it. It's like an activity that was once a guilty pleasure - pleasure now and maybe some guilt later - now induces the accompanying feeling guilt instantaneously, always-already right now, like the whole experience has been compressed into the present moment, but thereby cheapens it. Something like: overstimulated simultaneity in the present overwhelms and effectively eradicates the present. The drugs have lost their meaning as a mode of escapism, too, because the esacpe has become so routinized: "marijuana breaks" every few weeks have become a dependable part of his life. Smoking doesn't offer anything in the way of calling his subjectivity into question; it is constitutive part of that subjectivity. This reflects a larger trend that I observe in contemporary society: resistance to / disillusionment with the system is built into the system itself. Why is The Office such an hysterical show, or Office Space an hysterical movie? Because ultimately, jobs are "supposed" to be alienating. We've come to expect (and maybe even desire?) menial work as the status quo, and opposition is systemically built-in - the fact that workers or students will waste time is assumed and therefore preempted by stretching out the work day. Habits of all kinds, drugs and alcohol among them, are now just ways of coping (some more acceptable than others). Such is the production of the conditions of re-production of late capitalism. I'm not sure quite how, but I feel like this relates deeply to the idea of the action as its own antithesis or cure. The idea of taking drugs to kick the habit follows curious logic indeed. Maybe its a question of biopolitics, that is to say, how the system maintains, regulates, and distributes, bodies: if something like taking drugs is now somewhat of a requisite, or at least not a surprise, then the ultimate tool of biopolitical control would be to make the use of drugs themselves coincide always immediately with its own negation (lack of pleasure, breaking the habit, etc.). That way we offer a highly controled and ritualized, but ultimately vacuous way of dissipating behavior that threaten (are are perceived to threaten) society at large.</p>

Barring the subjugation of his wife, it's all a bit... glorious, albeit hyperbolic and (just a little) grotesque. An entertainment system that takes all the guesswork out of being entertained... anyone who's tried <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora </a> or even Itunes' Party shuffle is already familiar with "the procedures for ordering specific spontaneous pulses." Specific spontaneity... the idea just sounds so... nice, catering to our need for diversity or whatever but not frightening us with anything too "new"--I can handle Nirvana, and a taste of Alice in Chains, but throw Against Me or something a bit more "contemporary" into the mix and I'll panic. Or unrecordable InterLace pulse messages, single-play ROM (read only memory) self-erasing discs... yeah, we've all done the DRM thing. Initially, I was absorbed into the idea that we're delving into an alternate history / alternate reality or something. But with every page it feels a lot more like the right here and the right now, and someone's swapped my rose-tinted lenses with magnifying bifocals. Maybe Coca-Cola isn't outright sponsoring an entire year (and hopefully Depend Undergarments never will) but can we really go a day without seeing their products?</p>
