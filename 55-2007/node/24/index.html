<p>I also find the book....not really sexist....but overwhelmingly masculine.  I think that makes it hard for me to really *like* the book (as a female).  It just feels uncomfortable, but not just because some of the subjects are uncomfortable.  It's something in the book's personality, or in the author's voice.  Even when he is focused on a female, it is clearly a male writer.  Maybe it's the overabundance of penises that's doing it.  I think it's more than that, though.    </p>
<p>Does anyone else feel this way?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I completely agree. I actually felt nauseous during the scene with Katje and Pudding; I think sometimes Pynchon goes a bit too far in his descriptions. </p>
<p>I also agree that there's definitely a masculine slant to the novel. I hadn't actually thought about it until you mentioned it, but thinking about it, it's obviously there. Maybe it's because there are so many more male characters? And that often war is characterized as "masculine"? I'm not really too sure, but I definitely agree with you that the masculine slant is there.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I definitely do get the "masculine vibe" from this book.  (I think I'm actually going to write a blog entry about something more specific, so I'll just stop here.)</p>
<p>This may sound weird, but I wasn't put off by the amount of human excrement in the reading.  Maybe I just have a twisted sense of humor? Anyway, this isn't the first time I've read something involving human excrement and flatulence (never thought I'd say that!).  Actually, now that I think of it, the scene where Slothrop goes down the toilet reminds me of the end of "MacFlecknoe" by Dryden.  </p>
<p>Random note: I found this funny: "Slothrop, who believes that women, like Martians, have antennas men do not, keeps an eye on her."  pg. 191</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Somebody's blog entry title reads T.M.I.; it's a sentiment that I get sometimes reading Pynchon's work. I think you are all right to say that the novel includes a fair amount of gratuitous detail especially with descriptions of women. However, I think that the so-called "masculine vibe" is an important part of the reader's immersion into the world of Gravity's Rainbow. The setting of the characters in an intelligence bureau and the armed forces during the war would have been more or less a male dominated environment. As a result, the work, to a certain extent, justifiably reflects the period.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Indeed....the setting and the fact that war is usually defined by....well, not women, kept me from calling the book sexist.  It makes sense that the book should have that feel....but it is noticable and does affect me as a reader.  </p>
<p>I'm not really making a value judgement with my entry (which, knowing me, is really unusual.  I can be quite gung-ho to go down the sexism road), just commenting and examining my personal relationship to the book.  </p>
<p>And, to the person who is not really bothered by the shit.  (haha).  Have you read up to page 250?  (or whatever we have to have read for Wed)</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by Running Silent on 24 January 2007 - 12:14am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>As a male, I am interested to know more about this "masculine vibe" you speak of because I am not getting any of it. Say its because I am a man or whatever, but I feel like I would know too if this was a particularly masculine book. Even though most characters are male, none of them strike me as particularly masculine, at least not within the cultural contexts of today. If anything, some of the scenes strike me as effeminate and sometimes even covertly homosexual (which in todays cultural context is about as far away as you can get from the macho masculinity you speak of). Take for example the banana breakfast. Its not a particularly masculine scene and as the professor pointed out, the banana is rather phallic. Then there is the whole scene of the fear of being raped by black men, and Gottfried who is a male sex slave. All the talk about Pavlov, cause and effect etc seems so gender neutral to me. Maybe I'm missing something, but just because the characters are all male, is not reason enough for me to get a "masculine vibe."</p>

<p>It's not specifically the characters that give me the vibe.  It's the entire writing style and the author's voice.  So much of the book seems to have a masturbation (male) aura around it.  It's hard to describe.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>but even the writing style strikes me as very non-masculine. i mean, maybe what you should do, is define what masculine means to you. I would assume from the way you are using it, to mean more than just "there are men in this book." to me (in this context, not necessarily just the word masculine, but rather the masculine vibe), it evokes the macho ism of all testosterone people like Arnold Schwarzenegger. when someone says you are masculine, it doesn't mean to me that you are a wanker or that you are male, but that you are gruff and rough; a no-nonsense man of action. thats another thing, characters in this book seem very introspective. they do alot of thinking and musing. this is contrary to cultural images of masculinity which would have men as being decisive, with no thinking and all guts. As for the masturbation, I think if anything, it makes men look weak and pathetic.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I agree. It seems that the role of every major female character so far is primarily as a sexual object, and they've all been pretty promiscuous: Katje, Jessica(affair), the Casino dancers, etc. The masculine slant is so prominent, though, that it feels like Pynchon is making some sort of point about the era being so male-dominated. That's why I think I'm not too bothered by it all- because the overabundance of penises is so exaggerated that I feel like there must be some underlying satire. Maybe.</p>
<p>And about the shit...it is certainly disturbing, but it is almost refreshing to read about that sort of thing in work of literature. I've never read such explicit scenes, and while they made me cringe, they certainly woke me up and kept me reading.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Honestly, I don't think any of the "disturbing" things Pynchon puts in this novel are gratuitous. Quite the contrary, I feel he is making a point, shocking though it may be to some readers. </p>
<p>And on that note, I agree with you: it is refreshing. The only other prominent novel I've read that actually deals directly with human excrement is "Gulliver's Travels" (when Gulliver is a giant and the little people must set up a whole system for carting away his shit). I seemed to be the only person in the class happy to see a book dealing with something so ubiquitous and universal that, for many cultural reasons, we like to pretend does not exist. </p>
<p>Not to mention the symbolic importance of shit in this novel, as Professor Fitzpatrick mentioned, regarding shit being a human product without order or value, now suddenly having meaning. I forsee it having some potential importance in our later reading...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I think that while the book is oriented toward the masculine, it is not too hard for me to stomach. I think it is interesting to read a story from the testerone perspective and to see what these characters think of females. Clearly, females exist in this book mainly to fulfill the sexual urges of the males, (i.e. Slothrop) but what about the woman in the the cape and the boots waiting in the cell for the briadier? Clearly, this woman had an entirely different role. Her sadomasochism definitely exhibited the role of a dominant female. In addition, the role of Katje as a spy also asserts another dominant position for the female. Though she is mainly there to satisfy Slothrop's constant erections, it is clear that she has the upper hand in their relationship. Interesting. More about it later.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I, too, can sense a "male vibe" in this book, but not necessarily more obvious than other books I've read in the past. And it is certainly not sexist to the extent that it makes me uncomfortable. (the Pudding/dominatrix(Katje) scene, on the other hand...)<br />
But the masculinity of the novel isn't because it's overly "macho" or dominating, but more like Pynchon is purposefully avoiding more feminine aspects. Also, War is usually personified as masculine, so that might have to do with it, too. </p>
<p>Anyone read <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em>? Human excrement motif in there, too. These borderline postmodernists...</p>
