</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>A-and we're done. Hrmm. As i'm merely positing theories and the like, the following should be taken with a grain or two of salt (though i've never actually figured out what that means [either]).</p>
<p>Beyond the Zero. It's the title of the first section of the novel, and naturally should bear some importance. There's Absolute Zero, the point at which there is a complete lack of molecular motion, a complete and utter lack of "progress" that everyone (who? Them?) seems to be gunning for.  But what is this Absolute Zero? Or Zero, for that matter... Well, i've some ideas on the notion of Absolute Zero being implemented as maybe some kind of maintenance of the "status quo" (which in turn leads me down a slippery slope on the nature of Bureaucracy, who's actually in charge of what, effective leadership through the obscurity of, etc) but as I haven't really figured that out yet i'll file that in the "Maybe" pile. On to the Zero...The OED defines Zero as the arithmetical figure which denotes "nought." So, zero means nothing, fair enough. But what exactly is "Beyond" nothing? Well....</p>
<p>Early on in the novel we get Slothrop's little family history lesson, Shit, Money, and the Word as the family's chief product, America's chief product. And then there's page 27 (on the blue/teal or whatever covered edition, if you've got the new one you're two pages later, 29), "Each one in turn paying his debt to nature due and leaving the excess to the next link in the name's chain." So Slothrop's family has acknowledged Death as "a debt to Nature due" (26), with each family member paying their debt and leaving the excess. But wait, why an excess debt? Could it be related to converting "acres at a clip into paper" (28), a family that stuck to "flooded quarries and logged-off hillsides they'd left like signed confessions?" A family with a debt to pay. A debt incurred would be a negative number. And if Death is Zero, could Beyond zero (we'll call it "one") refer to the Afterlife? Well, sure, that much seems obvious. Page 4: "When it comes, will it come in darkness, or will it bring its own light?" "It" refers to the rocket. V-1s this early in the story, V-2s later. But also, to Death. The Rockets too then, as Death. So, that proverbial "white light" just before death... is it Death that brings the Light (Clarity?), or is it in seeing the Light that leads to Death? Bananas are involved.</p>
<p>Does anyone remember those freakishly large, delicious bananas? What about the Banana soil? I'm referring to page 5. It consists of the manure of prized pigs, dead pharmaceutical plants, the dead leaves of decorative trees, human vomit (waste, in a sense), an amalgam of all sorts of detritus that results in glorious Bananas. The "unbelievable black topsoil in which anything could grow" (5). As if Death and decay lead to a new beginning. Bananas as what's beyond the zero? Yes, but only sort of. Because that first rocket doesn't kill anything yet. "God has plucked it for him, out of its airless sky, like a steel banana" (8). So maybe not Bananas as beyond the Zero, but Rockets as great big bananas. Let's take a look at the banana, shall we? The peel protects the goodness inside, and we just sort of discard the peel, don't we? To get at what's in it? So bananas born of Death and decay are peeled to reveal the deliciousness within. And steel bananas, with their undesirable steel peels, those too are discarded, and those too reveal their deliciousness, their payload, Death. A sort of Banana breakfast, though significantly less palatable for most. "Danger's over, Banana Breakfast is saved. But it's only a reprieve. Isn't it. There will indeed be others, each just as likely to land on top of him" (8). And that's the fear, isn't it? I mean, who doesn't love Banana Breakfast--"Messmates throng here from all over England, even some who are allergic or outright hostile to bananas, just to watch" (5)-- all delicious and whatnot. And while it is a glorious little break from the War--"it is not so often Death is told so clearly to fuck off" (10)--Pirate gets the call soon afterwards, the War has found him. The War and Bananas and Death... still more to go there... But I haven't even begun on debts.</p>
<p>Dosed up on truth serum at the Abreaction ("The liberation by revival and expression of the emotion associated with forgotten or repressed ideas of the event that first caused it" - OED) Ward, Slothrop rants about the Kenosha Kid. I'll start with Forbes Parkhill's <a href="http://themodernword.com/pynchon/The_Kenosha_Kid_scans.pdf">"The Kenosha Kid,"</a> to get that bit out of the way. Watch out for that link, it's a .PDF--scans from the <a href="http://www.hyperarts.com/pynchon/gravity/images/kenosha-kid.jpg">August 1931 issue of "Western Rangers" magazine.</a> I hesitate to put too much stock into this reference (yet), as it's probably my looking into things too much versus any real source of inspiration of Pynchon's whilst writing the novel. That being said, the Kenosha Kid is "a professional gambler, a gunslinger who could outshoot them all--bar none" (8, Western Rangers). A sort of "Robin Hood" (13, Western Rangers) of the West, trimming the bankrolls of the wealthy and intentionally losing hands to the down-on-their-luck. </p>
<p>The link isn't wholly far-fetched, Slothrop and the Kenosha Kid. Freida the pig for example, in relation to the Kenosha Kid's horse on page 14 (Western rangers), where we learn that a horse is great buddy, as opposed to say women, because horses aren't judgmental of gamblers. Check 575 of the Teal edition for the "Pig is a jolly companion" song (Nice little tune, You'll never go wrong with a pig!). But I digress.</p>
<p>So, the "Kenosha Kid" is ostensibly a child of Kenosha. Well, Kenosha, Wisconsin got is start (sort of) as a bit of a factory town, producing millions of automobiles between 1902 and 1988 (according to wikipedia). Roll back the clock a bit and there's a bit about the "Western Emigration Company," circa 1835, lead by a Baptist clergyman (Rev. Peter Woodin; google it up if you'd like, 's a blog post, not a research paper) which took on a bunch of investors and headed West and eventually hit what will be known as Pike Creek, Wisconsin. Stuff happened, but i'm more interested in the industrial aspects, a few old-school automobile companies that were big names (Rambler, Nash, etc) for the early half of the 20th century till AMC, Chrysler, etc, took the reigns. Also, Abbot Laboratories (pharmaceutical company, antiseptics during WWII, HIV screening today, etc) is the largest private employer in Kenosha today, though I can't find numbers / dates that're dependable so there ends my history lesson.</p>
<p>If you're still with me, then i'm thinking the above little blurb on Kenosha Wisconsin sort of mimics Slothrop's own family, with the drive out west being the drive to the Western Hemisphere. The Emigration Company intrigues me, what with IG Farben being all sneaky with Slothrop's own Harvard education and training. But how is any of that related to the novel at all? Well, here's another musing from out of left field (and then i'm done, i promise): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_points_of_Calvinism">The Five Points of Calvinism</a> coupled with Puritan ideas on the Preterite and the Elect (which i don't have a handy link for [though a google search of my desktop reveals an old article I browsed some time ago on relation of the preterite and elect in Gravity's Rainbow to Characters in Catch-22... oww my brain burns]). The essential deal with the Preterite and the Elect is that god decided quite some time ago who's getting into heaven, and who's off to hell. The Five Points essentially dictate that all human beings are irrefutably sinful, but god has selected a few to get into heaven, and they can't refuse that "gift." Naturally, we don't know who's in the cool-kids club and who's going to want to start getting used to life without AC. Page 495 (I think it's 503 in the not teal version) for Springer's view on the subject.</p>
<p>So in this last section we meet Eddie Pensiero, an Italian soldier/ barber (Pensiero means Thought, by the way). And he's clipping a Colonel's hair--"God is who knows their number. Atropos is who severs them to different lengths. So, God under the aspect of Atropos, she who cannot be turned, is in possession of Eddie Pensiero tonight" (643). Fate and Thought. The Colonel has a bit to say about country life vs city life, where you "just move from crisis to crisis, each one brand-new, nothing to couple it back onto" (644). And yet his own hometown (Kenosha, Wisconsin), "it looks like Graves Registration back there in Wisconsin" (643). Death as the natural result of progress? Or mayhaps simply the return to the life-death-life (or death-life-death, which came first the chicken fetus or the mountain of concrete debris [643])? But where are we at the end? "A Hand to turn the time / Though thy Glass today be run" (760). Time's up but it never really is, is it, Life as a sin wave, lives as parabolas? Okay I suck at math so I'm just running on empty now. </p>
<p>'s why I love this book so much. It's like running to a great big tasty banana at the end of a trail, except you slip and fall and hey, you were on a treadmill the whole time. Maybe. It did seem a bit closer, this time.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Thinking about banannas....</p>
<p>Your love of the banana (ok, so the banana part is quite a spectacle and good, I agree) makes me think about the implications of that part....that is, that out of the shit comes the banana.  Plus, the banana breakfast is like the great foxhole of WWI.  It's rather disturbing if you think about the glorious banana as a phallic symbol....So......the fruit of the shit is a phallus.  So is the great brotherhood....</p>
<p>Again, not so female friendly....too many phallic symbols that are elevated....the book revolves around the rocket, the oh so might erection....I mean, come on....</p>
<p>And I'm not just LOOKING for these symbols....Pynchon talks about the rocket as a penis.  So it's really there and it's not just me being perverted.</p>
