This same logic seems to apply to other characters.  There's Nick the guy who has two kids and a wife and a job, but hidden beneath that there is Nick the murderer who his wife doesn't know.  I think it's really interesting to think about the way that Nick may be a father and a husband to the world, but he will always be the murderer in his heart.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I thought it was really interesting how DeLillo explicity connects Sister Edgar and J. Edgar Hoover as "Sister and Brother. A fantasy in cyberspace and a way of seeing the other side and a settling of differences that have less to do with gender than with difference itself, all argument, all conflict programmed out." Both characters exist in insular worlds without outside contact, yet cyberspace ultimately links them together albeit as only a "single fluctuating impulse now, a piece of coded information" (826). I'm not entirely sure as to what DeLillo means, but the ending seems very ambivalent, maybe intentionally so in order to mirror the increasing lack of a divide between what he calls cyberspace and the world.</p>

<p>I thought it was oddly fitting that Sister Edgar was described like death/some powerful force in the game of "Tag, You're It" that damns children forever. (717)  On page 720, Matt also describes her nun's habit like something the Grim Reaper would wear: "It was her after all, habit and hood.  The cloth was daunting.  She was all cloth.  She was a wall of laundered cloth.  A woman of the cloth."  </p>
<p>I also wondered about those dogtags that the kids have to wear so that their bodies could be identified "following the onset of atomic war" (717).  Wouldn't the dogtags be destroyed, as well?  What's the point then?</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>So.... we've finished, and I've arrived at what I assume is a clichÃ© question for this novel: Why is the last word "Peace" (827)?</p>
<p>Clearly, the novel has been deconstructing the Cold War, and the physical and psychological destruction it caused despite being "cold" (ex: the children with deformities, the nuclear waste, the fear and paranoia). So does the word represent Dellilo's plea? His wish?</p>
<p>Nick himself seems to have settled into some form of acceptance with himself and his life, but he says: "I long for the days of disorder. I want them back, the days when I was alive on the earth, rippling in the quick of my skin, heedless and real. I was dumb-muscled and angry and real. This is what I long for, the breach of peace, the days of disarray when I walked the real streets and did things slap-bang and felt angry and ready all the time, a danger to others and a distant mystery to myself" (810). Nick does not long for peace, but for the days of his irrational youthful anger and readiness for violence. Perhaps he is a victim of the Cold War era, then, and can never exist happily in a world of peace. He was a child of the Cold War, and his identity was constructed on that mentality.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I found the section that finally describes how and when Nick killed to be surprisingly disturbing and haunting. It starts on page 778 and ends right before the epilouge of the book. This scene is supposed to be the climax of the novel, even though it happened before most of the action. <em>Underworld</em> does follows the classic structure of a novel (intro, rising action, climax, falling action, conclusion), except for the movement of time.<br />
Anyway, I think this is probably the most emotional scene in the book, which would make sense as this is what forms Nick's character and estranges him from his brother, and makes him a "country of one". The description of George, "the little brightness in his eye", is startling. And obviously we ask- did he want to die? Was he playing Russian roulette- almost daring Nick to pull the trigger? Certainly seems like that, and Nick thinks so too. The repetition of "the way the man said no when he asked if it was loaded" and "first he poined the gun at the man's head" simulates Nick's thoughts- over and over and over- what just happened? This section is very well written and it shows more personality insight than we get in most of the rest of the book.</p>

The name used to be in the air, always on the verge of being spoken, of reentering the broadcast band and causing a brief excitation along the lined highways, but the shootings have evidently ended and the name is gone now. But sometimes I think of him and wonder if he is still out there, driving and looking, not done with this thing at all but only waiting" (807). </p>
<p>I keep coming back to this idea of history as presented by DeLillo, and even though this isn't exactly talking about "history," I feel like it's definitely talking about it, somehow. When I read this passage, it reminded me a lot of the whole Osama Bin Laden thing after September 11. Everyone was so freaked out and worried about him and what he was capable of, and capturing him was high priority (much the way it was with the Texas Highway Killer). But then, after time, slowly the fear wore off, and now it seems like Bin Laden (like the ficticious Highway Killer) is rarely even mentioned anymore.</p>

<p>This section with Chuckie and Louis was interesting in that it brought back the baseball and waste themes along with a commentary on family structure. It's interesting that this baseball that everyone's looking for is originally a desperate attempt to connect to a son, then a piece of a petty breakup, and finally waste along with the rest of his household trash.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I was intrigued by the multiple references to Watt's Tower in Underworld. I meant to write about this earlier, but haven't had a chance. Both Klara and Nick (I think) are entranced by the building- a structure built of waste. Wikipedia says its "non-traditional vernacular architecture" built primarily of steel, wire mesh and mortar. However, "found objects" cover the buildings:  bed frames, bottles, ceramic tiles, scrap metal and sea shells.<br />
The idea that trash can be compiled into a piece of art is baffling in the beginning, but then Klara herself turns to that idea- that we can save the waste and put it on clean museum walls and it becomes beautiful. Nick is reminded of his father as he strolls through Watts Towers "The work he (Rodia- the architect) did is a kind of swilring free-souled noise, a jazz cathedral, and the power of the thing, for me, the deep disturbance, was that my own ghost father was living in the walls." Good art stirs emotions- everyone knows that, but when you take stuff no one else wants and turn it into something that speaks- that's impressive. Nick's job is centered around boxing up waste and hiding it from the world- whereas Rodia and Klara find the most boring trash and turn it into art.</p>

<p>my friend Dan from home asked his father during the fall of the Berlin Wall (so he was like 5) what communism was.  His dad responded that "communism is when you go to the store to buy toilet paper but you can't because they only have TVs".</p>
<p>Now this might have absolutely no relation to the novel but I know Delillo does touch on the ways in which the communist government was out of touch with the people's needs.</p>

I don't know about the east-west / modern-postmodern parralel regarding Matt and Nick, but I think it'ss quite useful for unpacking the differences between Nick and Klara. Both moved westward from New York (allegorically, from modernity to postmodernity), but the two have reacted to the shifts in very different ways. The seeds of this theme are planted early. During their first encounter after so long, Klara wonders if life didn't "take an unreal turn at some point;" and "becasue [she's] famous," but because "it's just unreal" (73), to which Nick responds in swiftly modern judgment: "I lived responsibly in the real.</p>
