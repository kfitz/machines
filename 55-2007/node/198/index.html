</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I found the scene on pages 255-257ish to be really thought provoking. This is the scene when Orin and Hal are on the phone; Hal is telling Orin about his grief-therapy after he found his father ("Himself") who had comitted suicide by putting his head in a microwave. This scene was kind of sickly-humorous--like when Hal said that his first thought when he had come home that day was that "something smelled delicious!" (256). But it also kind of gave us some insight into Hal, or at least, I thought it did. </p>
<p>It was interesting how Hal went through anger (vented towards the grief-therapist) and then a kind of guilt-denial and then accepted things and then absolved himself, all within one visit to the therapist's office. It's like his feelings were kind of on auto-pilot, and fast-forwarded at the same time. At one point Orin says, "you really did grieve, and you can tell me what it was like" (256), and Hal completely avoids the subject. I wonder if this grieving process was real--as in, able to move Hal along, or if he's still kind of stuck on it? I feel like this incident has to affect Hal's life in some way: it was pretty traumatic, after all. Maybe this has some sort of impact on the scene at the beginning of the novel, with Hal's "problematic" social skills?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I think it's also really disturbing that what Hal gets out of his grief therapy is not any sort of real peace with his Dad's suicide so much as beating the perceived challenge that the therapist puts in front of him. The tennis academy seems to suffer from the similar problem of pushing the challenge of making the "Show" without really creating any path toward fulfillment except for an extremely select few. In some ways, Hal reminds me of Nick Shay in that we're not entirely sure that he's really dealt with this incident or that he feels no pain from it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I also thought it was really interesting how Hal was more disturbed by the fact that he didn't know what the therapist wanted. He was so used to pleasing people and doing everything perfectly that he was really at a loss when it came to these therapy sessions. Eventually, he read some textbooks and found out all he needed to know to get him out of his misery. Also, the passage about the therapist's hands was so wierd. What was the point of his having hands like a little girl? Was that implying he wasn't capable?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I wonder whether he read those textbooks on therapy and grief sessions to know how to relieve his grief, or if he read those books to see what exactly he was "supposed" to feel after his father's suicide. I'm not sure whether his father's death really broke his heart. It changed his life, to be sure, but the parents in this family clearly hardly know who their children really are. It's hard to gauge whether Hal even understands his own emotions, or whether he only pretends to have them because he believes that he should.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I thought that Hal's experience with the therapist was fascinating.  I think his character's reaction to the entire situation made perfect sense, and that simply wanting to "pass the test" of grieving fit perfectly.  I know a lot of kids who have fallen into the same sort of trap, always expecting to "get an A" even when there's no grade to be had, and they are looking at the wrong way...</p>
<p>on the other hand, the time with the therapist sort of shows the therapist as somewhat useless (from Hal's point of view)...and I think that view is relatively common, and I know I've talked to professionals before and thought "this is such a waste of my time..."  To see Hal's reaction was sort of refreshing.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I got the sense at the beginning of the book that Hal was not really a normal kid.  I thought maybe he was autistic because he has an incredible memory and there is that scene where his dad confronts him for being too quiet.  But now I'm not so sure.  Hal seems to be pretty normal, besides being very smart and relatively practical instead of emotional.  Anyone have any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don't think the point is so much that therapy is / easily can be useless (though I do empathize with Potted Plant's disheartening experience talking to professionals), but that Hal's expectations are out of whack. It did indeed seem like he was trying to "pass," to perform in the same way that he performs everything else: perform tennis adeptness; perfrom brilliance; even perform discontent that can only be ameliorated with drugs. In this sense, Hal is very much like Nick with his filmic caricature of Italian identity. Only in the movies are people "cured" after one visit to the analyst. Not necessarily because they only went once, but because therapy experience never lingers on the screen for longer than a +/- five minute scene. The audience gets to see the breakthrough, but never the backstory; the backstory purports to be simply implied, but I think in an important sense, it gets completely lost. Nowadays, filmic representations precede (for most people) actual experience in therapy. Can we blame people (like Hal) for wanting immediate results? Well, yes. But one gets the sense from film that if you say the right things, maybe talk about your mother sufficiently, cry a little, etc., immediate results might actually be possible. Drugs, in some ways, epitomize this notion of immediate results. Screw getting endorphines indirectly - from tennis or  reading books like Infinite Jest or anything else - just inject them directly to your bloodstream.</p>
