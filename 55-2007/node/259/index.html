</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I just wanted to explain my take on why Infinite Jest, a video of mother saying "i'm sorry" over and over again is as entertaining as it is. My reasoning may seem childish if not outright silly but I think that part of the reason this video is as addicting as it is because the idea of a motherly apology is so remote. Call me crazy and playing on exaggerations and jokes, but I don't think anyone can deny that at some point in their life before adulthood, they were "wronged" in some way and felt they deserved an apology they never received. What's more, you probably were forced to admit that you were at fault even when you truly believed otherwise; in a sense, a false forced confession. This double whammy makes people loose faith in any idea of justice and fairness. Moreover, because parents are the authority and monopolizer of power within a family unit, we as children view such an act as an abuse of power.<br />
     Therefore, the apology rectifies all such internal psychological injuries. It first is the apology we never recieved, and to us acts as a correction of a great injustice. Secondly, it levels the hierarchy of power because this person who is normally above us has stooped below to apologize. Its important to note that I am explaining this from a rather abstract psychological perspective and should in no way be taken in literal terms; i mean lets face it, who would honestly get suicidally captivated watching their mother apologize over and over again?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I think the idea you present here is really interesting. I stopped to think about it, and--even now, when I'm 19--it seems like my parents often feel like they don't have to apologize to me because I'm their kid and thus they just "shouldn't have to". And I think your point about the abstract psychological perspective is definitely valid; you can compare it to the Oedipus complex (after all, guys don't actually want to have sex with their mother and kill their father; it's just some psychological impulse, like seeing your mother apologize apparently is here).  I wonder if J.O.I planned it to appeal to these psychological underpinnings . . . ?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Do we know much of Jim Incandenza's mother? I don't think so- we here about his father. Maybe I'm just forgetting, but it could also be that an apology from his mother is what J.O.I is searching for, and he creates the film for himself...<br />
Also, what we talked about in class still intrigues me. What is the mother apologizes for? Is it just a general apology, or, because it is directed at an infant, is it an "I'm sorry for bringing you into this world"? Afterall, the first thing a baby does is scream. Does J.O.I have such a pessimistic look on the world? Or, more importantly, does everyone believe that it's their mother's fault for bringing them into the world? It's a reverse of the women as bringers-of-life theory. huh.<br />
I was going to say one more thing, but I forget... oops!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>That's what I tend to see it as--an apology for bringing you into the world. The womb and infantile state have been characterized throughout the book as the ideal, and bringing you into the world involves forcing you to leave the womb. The book has shown the world as a place filled with destructive decisions, addictions, incidents of molestation, immense pain, depression, etc., which leaves one longing for the perfection/ignorance? of the womb or period before birth or conciousness.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by littlerock on 4 April 2007 - 12:44am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>What I didn't get was why this book followed a story of mothers of the next life killing their children and then giving birth to them again, only so that the mother of their next life can kill them and complete the cycle once again.... sure, mothers give birth and create life, but how do they take it away? And killing a person from a previous life only to bring them to their womb and give them life? Is this reincarnation? Mothers as simultanious murderers and life-givers? Huh?</p>
<p>Also, in terms of the psychology of a child desiring an apology from the people who dominated and shaped their lives (their parents), I can buy that but.... why don't people also desire an apology from the father? When Hal was in that Inner Infant group, members were complaining about not getting enough love as a child, and just wanting to be held. Perhaps that unfulfilled desire for attention warrants an apology. But why not from both parents? All I know is that I grew up with a single father, so hearing a mother figure apologize to me doesn't seem particularly satisfying or entertaining :-/</p>

    <div class="content"><p>That was definately something I was struggling to understand, why it wasn't the father. It could be that the apology for unfairness is also coupled with the apology for bringing the child out of the womb. I know for you that the idea of a mother apologizing is not something that you really connect with, but for me at least, even if both parents have wronged me, there is something more powerful and moving when my mother apologizes. Perhaps it is because our culture paints mothers as the traditional head of child rearing that we associate them with the highest positions of power (and thus the greatest satisfaction from their apology). No doubt, the impact of a mother's apology depends on many, many circumstances, that are different to each family.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by body without organs on 4 April 2007 - 10:53am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I read this whole thing as a critique of the meta-narratives that people generally employ to understand their own lives, as well as history. Questions like, "why not an appology from the father?" to my mind gets to the crux of the matter: why have some questions, some impulses (e.g. oedipal or castration narratives), some desires, been privileged over others? I think there are actually profound reasons to object to seeing the womb as Eden-like, the harmonious totality before the fall into language that we must constantly seek to re-create. Indeed, I read the fact that this form of entertainment is so captivating as a devastating critique of whatever cultural horizon Wallace is critiquing (American? North American?): its precisely the kind of paradise-fall-alienation-reconciliation narrative that leads people to continually seek their fix, to be unable to deal with plateaus.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by Stumpy on 4 April 2007 - 11:29am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>First of all, I think that it could be an apology for what hasn't even happened yet.  Everyone in AA seems to blame their past for why they fell into drugs and alcohol.  You are the product of your upbringing and the book puts a lot of emphasis on this.  Maybe the mother is apologizing for how she is going to screw you up in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Also, I agree that there is a connection between the apology needing to come from the mother and the fall of Eden.  When Gately is talking to the ghost of James Orin Incandenza, JOI  says that he always thought it was the mother's fault that Hal was so quiet.  Even if we don't have the perception that it is always the mother's fault, JOI seemed to, and since he thought this, he probably thought it extended to others and that's why he included it in his film.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I see this as the extension of the AA meeting where the people talk about their Disease and one flat out talks about it while the other addict tries to justify her addiction through the story of the molested deformed sister (story should probably be burned into your mind). What people want to hear, in fact, what's so pleasing about entertainment is that it's such a passive activity. I think the apology essentially gives people a cause, a meaning and someone responsible else to be responsible for what they've done. Paradoxically, it frees people from their responsibility but such an outlook eliminates free will.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm really interested in why the previous versions of the Infinite Jest film failed. It's such a simple concept- a mother apologizing over and over, so why didn't the versions 1-4 take? What does Joelle herself signify in this whole equation? Would viewers care as much if they were receiving the apology from someone who wasn't the PGOAT?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The book says somewhere that the first three versions did not have the PGOAT in it.  Then finally James convinced her to do it.  The point I think is that you need the apology from this seemingly perfect human being.  And also, the book says that Joelle by herself is almost as compelling as the film.  The combination of the perfect action and the perfect mother is what made Infinite Jest the addiction that it is.   My question is, what is the difference between the 4th and 5th versions?  I think it said that the 4th version was never released...</p>
