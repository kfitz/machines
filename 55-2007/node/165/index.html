</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>A friend found out we're reading Underworld for class, and asked if it's worth reading; if it's a "page turner."  I replied that it isn't in the traditional sense of the word, but more of a sweeping American epic.  "Like the Great American Novel?" she joked, having read far too many of those in her time here.</p>
<p>I've read that Underworld was, in fact, Don DeLillo's attempt at the Great American Novel.  But what exactly is THE Great American Novel?  Wikipedia says it "is the concept of a novel that perfectly represents the spirit of life in the United States at the time of its publication. It is presumed to be written by an American author who is knowledgeable about the state, culture, and perspective of the common American citizen."</p>
<p>Okay.  But then doesn't that make Gravity's Rainbow a sort of Great American Novel about the Cold War as well, even though it's not set here or then?</p>
<p>And what is it about both of the books we've read that makes me shy away from putting them in the same category as To Kill A Mockingbird, Huckleberry Finn, The Catcher in the Rye, The Sound and the Fury, The Great Gatsby, or The Grapes of Wrath?  Their disaffected post-modern stance, maybe.  Or is it just that neither has the amount of history behind it as these do?  Maybe it's only that we weren't made to read these in high school.  All of them, these two included, deal with deep-seated American issues, whether acted out on a large scale or on the personal stage.  Who decides what is a Great American Novel, anyway?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Definitely a good final question. If my high school curriculum was any indication, I think it's safe to say that the wrong people are deciding what comprises a Great American Novel. The common thread in my mental reprsentation of such a novel, as well as your two prototypic examples, is not just in setting or theme but, I would say most importantly, in narrative. Rises and falls, many lessons learned, more or less obvious ethical weight of characters, pervade in all six of those (at least on my reading). Even Catcher in the Rye, which might be slightly more iconoclastic than the others, still follows these trends in important ways. According to a set of criteria like this, GR (and to be it seems like Underworld too, though I'll withhold my verdict until we finish) might be the foremost anti-Great American Novel - no finger-wagging, no dialectical climax and denoument, ethical ambivalence everywhere.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Yes, I agree with both of you. As a general rule I tend to not read bestsellers simply because they often just are page turners and they really are not a representative of good literature at all. (Um, the DaVinci Code?) Just because one book is popular doesn't mean it is good. But you are right. How do you classify the Great American novel? I would say often they seem to be quite the opposite of a page turner. They are often eschewed by society at first because they are dark, or different or they tackle extremely complex or formerly "hush-hush" topics. They seem to be more avant garde. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>i wouldn't write of bestsellers so quickly.  The nytimes bestseller list is an incredibly complex organism.  After all:</p>
<p>Underworld as bestseller! The New York Times Book Review chart has had Underworld at:</p>

5 on Oct. 5, 1997<br />

10 on Nov. 16, 1997</p>
<p>I have no problem grouping Underworld with Huck Finn and Grapes of Wrath.</p>
<p>I would put Gravity's Rainbow in its own category.  Same with Sound and the Fury.</p>
<p>Gatsby, Mockingbird, and Catcher are smaller.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I can see grouping Underworld with Huck Finn, Catcher in the Rye, or the Great Gatsby....</p>
<p>of course, the length is different.  </p>
<p>The label "great american novel" is chosen by a select few.  There are certain books our society says we must read to be educated people.  It gives us a common education, to a certain extent, further defining our culture.  (i'm in CORE II politics and Culture, so we've talked about this)</p>
<p>The "great american novels" somehow embody something that society wants us to learn...it doesn't have much to do with how good the book is.  Also, books written by those who are, say, minortities, have a harder time, or a longer time, getting their books on that list...it's interesting.  I think the term is not one you can use without realizing it's about so much more than literary merit or literary content...it has to do with our society, or rather, what we percieve as being our society.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I would suggest that the term "Great American Novel" has become a caricature or simulacrum of itself, much like "the American dream." They've been emptied of content, any sort of empirical reality they might have reflected at one point (e.g. literary criteria, social mobility, etc.) are now obscelete. They exist as floating signifiers. And dangerous ones at that.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Yes.  In my 11th grade english class (which should have been called "American dream class" instead of "Accelerated English" we "defined" the American Dream.  What did our class conclude?  Four words: Freedom, Happiness, Hope, and something else....whatever it was, it was truly silly.  This experience leads me to agree with you about the meaninglessness of these words in our society.</p>
