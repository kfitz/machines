Traditionally, an author will introduce a character using both first and last names, and then use just one throughout the novel, usually the last name.  Pynchon instead uses many names for each character.  Slopthrop, Tyrone, Rocketman, Raketenmensch, etc.  Greta, Margherita, Mrs. Erddman. Enzian, Oberst, (that name that starts with an n that I cannot remember).  At the end of the novel there is a lot of commentary about the fragmentation of Slothrop.  On page 752 it says, "He is being broken down instead, and scattered.</p>

When physicists look at gravitational fields, they consider all objects within a given field to have negative energy to indicate their captivity in that gravitational field. If an object has exactly enough energy to escape that field, it has 0 energy. In essence when it goes beyond that 0, it becomes free from the gravitational system. This bit describing the rocket's ascent at the very end made me think of a possible explanation for what constitutes going "beyond the zero":</p>

On page 760 it reads, "The title is New Dope, and that's what it is about, a brand new kind of dope that nobody's ever heard of. One of the most annoying characteristics of the shit is that the minute you take it you are rendered incapable of ever telling anybody what it's like or worse, where to get any. Dealers are as in the dark as anybody. " I thought this passage was so interesting because it was just another rocket metaphor and, I think, a strong theme for this book.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>"With his crank here young Paddy is practicing another form of Eddie's gift, though he's transmitting not receiving.  The bulb appears to burn steadily, but this is really a succession of electric peaks and valleys, passing by at a speed that depends on how fast paddy is cranking.  It's only that the wire inside the bulb unbrightens slow enough before the next peak shows up that fools us into seeing a steady light.  It's really a train of imperceptible light and dark.  Usually imperceptible.  The message is never conscious on Paddy's part." (654) </p>
<p>This passage really reminded me of Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  I don't know if Pynchon was in any way influenced by that novella, but here's why I think he was.  One of the major motifs in HoD is darkness and light.  Traditionally thinking equates light with enlightenment/civilization and darkness with savageness/primitivism.  The bulb that Paddy is cranking is not actually burning steadily, but only appears so because of the rapid bursts of light.  Likewise in HoD, Marlow says, "We live in the flicker," which is "like a flash of lightning." (48 of the Barnes and Noble edition I own.)  I think it's interesting that Pynchon writes that we are fooled into seeing a steady light.  In HoD, ultimately, it can be determined that civilization itself, with its acts of violence (aka colonization, which is a theme present in both books), is savage.  There is an inversion of light and dark at the end, when readers are led into the heart of an immense darkness in London, not the Congo.  Relating this back to Pynchon's GR, this passage therefore seems to assert what Conrad wrote in his work:  Europeans/white men who carry the burden to civilize others blindly follow the belief that they are improving the world and perpetuating civilization; however, what they believe to be enlightened thoughts and actions are also (imperceptibly) dark and savage.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>This is partly in response to the "Dialectics" post below, but I think this theme is prevalent enough in Gravity's Rainbow to merit its own post. Essentially, I think Pynchon exhibits a vehemently anti-dialectical sensibility. The word "dialectic" has become associated most readily with Hegel, a 19th century German philosopher who posited that History (with a notably capital "H") progresses according to a play of opposites: the "thesis" (an idea/structure/entity) meets its "antithesis" (something that opposes it) and the two come together, according to a dual logic of negation and elevation, as the "synthesis" (the resulting higher truth that is able to comprehend both as a unified totality). Science supposedly works like this: the theory of the times holds that the earth is the center of the universe (thesis), astronomical evidence contradicts the the theory (antithesis), and a higher-level explantion results. So according to Hegel, History is explicable by way of an analogous scientific process: two opposing ideas about how to structure the world come together, wrestle in the public arena, and ultimately are subsumed by something of a higher order - a more enlightened idea of how to structure the world that takes the good aspects of both initial ideas into account.</p>

That's where religion had the edge, for centuries. Religion was always about death. It was not used as an opiate so much as a technique--it got people to die for one particular set of beliefs about death'" (715). </p>
<p>I thought this passage was really interesting, especially considering its proximity to the end of the novel. First, the notion of religion being about death really struck me. I guess I've always considered religion to be about life--the conduct of people and that type of thing. Some religions are even focus on the lives of certain figures. But religions do tend to emphasize what happens after life too, I guess. And many religions do celebrate martyrdom. The last part of the passage, I think, is quite accurate and well-written.</p>

</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Although I'm sure some of it went over my head, I was particularly fond of the long chapter in section 4 that was broken down into short snippets of moments and stories. This section is near the end of the novel (in the 700's pages) and I feel that it opens up some new ideas while pulling others together (especially regarding Slothrop). I'm just going to talk about a few of the sections I thought were interesting and see what you guys think.</p>
<p>Quite a few of these sections dealt with Slothrop, specifically his childhood and his family. One section, called "Mom Slothrop's Letter to Embassador Kennedy" was particularly interesting to me because it's essentially a letter where Slothrop's mother self-consciously expresses her serious concern for little Tyrone. She came off as an intensely depressed woman who drowns her sorrows in a falsely cheery demeanor and one too many martini's. She begins the letter very playfully, but says she feels like "they're pieces of the Heavenly City falling down." She says "Sometimes things aren't very clear [...] in my heart I kep getting this terrible fear, this empty place, and it's very hard at times to really belive in a Plan with a shape bigger than I can see" (682 in my book). Perhaps she feels regret and confusion about the things Tyrone is being subjected to, but is grappling with the people who tell her that it is necessary. I think this highlights the plight of multiple characters in this book who are working towards a cause they don't fully understand, or are driven by anonymous powers and forces.</p>

<p>I found this entire speech of Blicero's to be not only out of character for the usually-sadistic captain, but also quite beautiful (for what it is). In the midst of whipping Gottfried, Blicero stops to rant on life, death, original and subsequent sin and love. Are these actually some of Blicero's last words- is he dying? Or just feeling his mortality? Is Blicero feeling regret for all the rockets he's helped create- all the innocent deaths he has caused? Is he asking for redemption?</p>
