<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Course 
  Description</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This course will serve 
  as an introduction to the art, craft, and business of writing for film. Please 
  note one immediate qualification of that description, however: while I have 
  a deep and abiding love for experimental and independent film, this class will 
  concentrate on the classic Hollywood form. This form, contrary to popular belief, 
  does not prevent the creation of art; in fact, the art lies in figuring out 
  how to make what appears to be a rigid structure work for rather than against 
  you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To that end, we will spend 
  the first few weeks discussing screenplay structure and format and watching 
  and exploring movies in terms of the Hollywood form, after which we will begin 
  reading and workshopping scenes. Throughout the semester, we will keep abreast 
  of contemporary Hollywood film by seeing and talking about numerous movies. 
  And we will investigate the methods of representation that are unique to film 
  by reading a number of novels and watching their film adaptations. What makes 
  a story "filmic"? And what do you have to do to work within the Hollywood dream 
  machine? </font> </p>
