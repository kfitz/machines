  Requirements and Grading</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your requirements are few; 
  take them seriously. Being a workshop, what you get out of this class will derive 
  in great measure from what you put into it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Attendance, preparedness, 
  and participation.</b> As our work here will revolve around discussion, your 
  participation and preparedness are indispensable, and will be graded. You will 
  be permitted one unexcused absence; each additional unexcused absence lowers 
  your final grade one step. Moreover, chronic late arrivals will not be tolerated; 
  for every three late arrivals, one unexcused absence will accrue. Finally, be 
  aware that presence without preparedness does not count. Do the reading; do 
  the writing; do it on time. <b>(20%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Brief writing assignments.</b> 
  Throughout the semester, you will be given a number of brief writing assignments; 
  some are listed on this syllabus, and others may be added as called for. Some 
  will be directed toward the analysis of the films we watch and screenplays we 
  read. Some will be preliminary stages in producing your own screenplay. None 
  of these will be graded individually, but all are required, and they will receive 
  a cumulative grade at the end of the semester. <b>(30%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Screenplay.</b> This 
  will comprise by far the bulk of the work you do this semester; <i>no later 
  than</i> the last week of class, you will turn in a <i>revised</i> version of 
  a <i>workshopped</i> full-length screenplay in <i>flawless screenplay format.</i> 
  Errors in format, spelling, grammar, etc., etc., etc., will lower your final 
  grade. Scripts with egregious formatting or typographic errors will be returned 
  unread, and will incur late penalties until resubmitted. <b>(50%)</b> </font></p>
