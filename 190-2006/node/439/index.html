    <div class="content"><p>I just finished reading http://www.rushkoff.com/essay/sportswearinternational.html, an article on why companies will profit economically by focusing their energies on coming up with more creative ideas/designs instead of looking to kids for what's cool. </p>
<p>Here is one of the author's more interesting points:</p>
<p>"The problem with being the center of attention is that it gives [teenagers] nowhere to turn, themselves. When even their parents long for the adolescent sexual utopia of the Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue or the idyllic and equally adult-less Dawson's Creek, kids have nothing left to aspire towards. None of them are experiencing anything close to the good times suggested by these brand-image universes. They are teenagers, for God's sake. It's a terrible, terrifying time. But they have been put at the very center of the universe. Marketers want to please them. Their parents want to *be* them. All eyes, and all cameras, are trained on the teen."</p>
<p>I think this point is a good one. Just look at the small kids trying to dress like teenagers and wearing makeup as a teen would. Or notice the middle-aged woman who looks as though she accidentally walked into her daughter's closet that morning instead of her own. </p>
<p>Another one of Rushkoff's ideas that struck me is:</p>
<p>"And by removing yourselves -- yes, you adults -- from the equation, you have denied your young customers the one thing they could really use from you: your adult creativity. Instead, you relegate kids to a prison of mirrors, and rationalize that you're simply meeting popular demand"</p>
<p>Considering that the author, Douglas Rushkoff, teaches media theory at NYU, it is kind of interesting that he'd say teen consumers could benefit from anything marketers have to offer at all, and furthermore, act as a consultant for these companies, telling them what they should be doing. The idea that looking to kids for ideas on what to market and how to market it is to under-use your own resources (adults) is pretty cool though. It makes sense. As Rushkoff points out, "In most societies, teens tend to emulate adults". There has been a shift in America and now this is not the case, but teens emulating adults does appear to be the natural tendency so perhaps there would be momentum if a swing back toward that system began.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that the shift of focus from adults to teens is something we have seen in our lifetimes. While we were still kids, there really wasn't such a pull to emulate teens rather than adults. Think about the shows that were on television. Hardly any were geared for a teenage audience. And when shows did attempt to fill this hole they did not always meet much success. My So-Called Life, for example, was cancelled after just one season. As we entered middle school, however, things were already changing. The WB was born, teen pop made a comeback (You know you loved N'Sync), media and marketers were finally catching onto the fact that kids' disposable income surpassed their parents' (a phenomenon that occurred in the 80s).</p>

  <div class="content"><p>i would argue that the emulation of teen culture is not that new of a phenomenon, at least not one where we saw the rise of it during our lifetimes. it may take a different, more extreme form now. however, though my so-called life was cancelled, you had Beverly Hills 90210 thriving for years, the Peter Engel machine of Saturday teen shows ranging from (though range is not the best word since all these shows were basically the same) Saved by the Bell, to California Dreams, to USA high, which all became popular in the early to the mid-nineties. in the eighties, there was the popularity of john hughes movies, and in the sixties you had the swinging beach movies entrenched in teenage hormones with frankie avalon and annette funicello. however, i would argue that though these phenomenons may have been rooted in real life teen culture, how they were constructed and commodified made them, makes them some adults' view points on what teen culture is, as opposed to being the real thing (but is there a real thing?). from 90210, to Saved by the Bell, to even Dawson's Creek, you have thirty year olds playing 15 year olds who are living a highly stylized and glamorized life. the focus is on teenagers, but are teenagers really at the creative focus of it, or is it simply CEO's perceptions of teen culture? growing up, (since tv was my babysitter), a lot of my expectations of what it would be like to be a teenager came from TV and films. honestly, i can't say how much of that impacted the way i actually went about my teen years. on one hand, you have tv, film, etc. going ape-crazy with researching the latest cool trend amongst teens, however many teens are getting their cues and ideas from those very mediums, so it's not a linear relationship of who's impacting whom, it's more cyclical. </p>
<p>perhaps what doomed my so called life (and another wonderful show, freaks and geeks), was that it offered a fairly realistic, relatable, and well-written account of being a teenager.</p>

<p>Sad but you're probably right. Also, unlike Dawsons Creek, etc. My So-Called Life had teens playing teens. This seems like it would be a draw (it was for me), but I wonder if kids like to have people to look up to even if they're playing people who are the same age as them?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>In Canada, they've had the wonderful Degrassi series, which featured teens playing teens, and addressing fairly realistic issues that people had to deal with. There's "Degrassi Junior High", "Degrassi Hight", and now, my favorite, "Degrassi: The Next Generation". They've addressed issues such as sexual assault, coming out, cutting, bipolarism, pregnancy, cheating, religion, physical ability, violence in schools, etc. Most of the things that happen to the characters are fairly realistic. The only thing that's not realistic is that these things keep on happening to the same people...so you're like whoah!!! it's normal that those things happen, just not at the rate they do happen on the show. It is pretty awesome! You should watch it on the click (then.com).</p>

  <div class="content"><p>DUDE, how creepy that I just blogged advertiser's focus on teens too!  It seemed so strange when we were kids/teens and all of a suden movies started being released that were about us, for us...  That's the first place I remember seeing the focus shift to the teen market (Clueless, Empire Records...and even though technically we couldn't see them, I feel like slasher movies were pretty much targeted at us when they came out) but I'm sure it happened in much subtler ways before I ever noticed it.  And remember when all those teen magazines really started coming out, when it wasn't just Seventeen anymore but all of a sudden there was Sassy, and later CosmoGirl?  I can't help but think that's had an indelible effect on us.</p>
