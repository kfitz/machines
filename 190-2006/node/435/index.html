    <div class="content"><p>a while ago, i made a post saying about how we haven't really discussed how digital technology is impacting other parts of the world, in a way that actually takes into account the specific situations of those parts of the world. one topic that may be an interesting example is the Nigerian film industry. When I went abroad to Cameroon, Nigerian films were pretty popular there, even though the area where I lived was a French speaking area and Nigerian films are typically in English (if in a Western language). For me, studying pop cultures of different countries is an interesting way to learn about that country and its culture, since so much of my personal experience has been shaped by Western culture. Also, what interests me is when countries are able to have a thriving pop culture of their own, in movies, in music, etc. and not be dominated by icons of the West, like Tomb Raider or Justin Timberlake (now i'm just trying to see how many times I can mention JT in a blog. I really don't like him THAT much, it's more that i'm really surprised that I like him at all so i feel like shouting in from the rooftops...but anyways). for instance, i'm a big fan of bollywood for that very reason. pop culture becomes a sign of resistance. also, it's interesting to see what topics and subjects are considered important, and what ways of addressing them. in Nigerian films, one could often see issues of HIV/AIDS, corruption, the occult, etc. that is specific to that country. in addition to that, i'm fascinated when pop cultures of one non-western country becomes really popular in another country, just because i'm curious about what leads to that, since western pop culture is so wide spread due to the specific reason of colonialism and imperialism. this is why nigerian cinema interests me so.</p>
<p>i decided to look up nigerian cinema on wikipedia to see if i can contextualize it more. apparently it's referred to as "Nollywood". I don't know if I like it. It's too much a copy of Bollywood, which some people view as a condescending term in itself. Some people don't like Bollywood because it's saying that it's an Indian derivative of Hollywood, when it's a separate, thriving entity in its own right. Bollywood, though I can kind of understand. BOmbay + HOLLYWOOD. The leap from Nigeria to Nollywood is a bit of a stretch and doesn't sound aurally pleasing. Also, here are other example of "ollywoods" such as Chollywood, Dhaliwood, Pollywood, Tollywood, etc. that refer to different film industries in different countries. This labeling kind of makes these film industries sound like part of a fleeting phenomenons, as opposed to legitimate in their own right.</p>
<p>anyways...back to nollywood. In the last decade or so, Nigerian films have boomed in popularity and fiscal success. Many attribute this to the spread of digital technology. Using HD cameras instead of bulky ones, using digital editing software, and the ability to produce and distribute more easily has been credited for this boom. it's cheap to make a film. Lots and lots films are made in little time (in a little over a week some times). films are most commonly distributed as vcds or dvds in market places, costing about $2 each, so it's very affordable to many Nigerians from different classes. in Nigeria, people tend to watch things on home video more than going to a movie theatre, in a way that's different than in the u.s. Straight to Video films become very popular, since video is the main way of distributing. In the U.S., things that are straight to video isn't as popular, even though renting and buying DVD's are becoming more popular than going to the theatre (since it's so expensive). however, people still go to the movies, and the movies that are rented the most are movies that were out in theatres. though it's growing less popular, there's still that valuing of going to the movies, where you have this process where a legitimate film has to come out in theatres first and then go on video, etc. etc.</p>
<p>back to my though about digital and the world. here you have a case where nigerians are using digitial technology for their own means in their own ways. in nollywood, films are being created that better reflect the experiences and issues of nigerians, than hollywood fare. the facility in creating this films, and distributing them in a way that is affordable to a large amount of people, is due in large part to digitial technology. however, how it's being distributed, as straight to VCD or DVD products, is something that doesn't happen in the West. There are unique ways that this technology is being used and embraced that is specific to the context of Nigerian society, culture, etc. Though one can make the statement that technology is revolutionizing the world, it's important to remember that that impact may and will probably look different in different places. though it's impact may happen universal, the actual impact itself, and how it looks like and fuctions, may not be universal and will probably take different forms.</p>
