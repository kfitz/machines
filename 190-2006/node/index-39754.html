    <div class="content"><p>Since I'm sure no one is actually reading blog posts now that the semester is over, and most people are probably writing fervently to finish their blogs, I won't take much care with the words I use, grammar, speliing, or punctuation. I feel like I'm actually typing this for nobody, which is liberating.</p>
<p>Well, the other day,  was reading a Newsweeks article about the internet. Now, I don't know statistics, and I can't remember if the article addressed this issue specifically, but I'm just guessing that if it's not already a more lucrative medium than television, it surely will be one day. In fact, I bet in our lifetimes, all television is broadcast through some sort of an "internet" connection.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In the beginning of the semester I hated the idea of the blog.  I cringed every time I opened the website and glared at the blank page in front of me.  NO!  I won't share my ideas with the class!  I hate the idea of class participation enough, don't make me show people how poorly I write, or how little I understand some of these readings.  I don't do well with social pressure.</p>
<p>Little by little I warmed up to the blog.  I saw it as a place to rant or share my ideas, post episodes of South Park and link to fun clips and articles.  It helped even more after I started posting thesis-related entries that allowed me to explore my thoughts a bit and develop my argument.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I picked up a People magazine today to catch up on the celebrity trash I can't read at People.com.  Normally I don't bother to read the "articles" (and I use the word lightly with People), because they always seem random, and, who buys People to read the articles anyways?  I appreciate the pictures and two-sentence gossip blurbs- they are <em>much</em> more conducive to the brain-numbing activity I'm looking for when I fork over the $3.49 (?!) for the magazine.<br />
In any case, I decided to give 'em a chance and read through the article "When There's Nowhere to Turn" by Joanne Fowler.  </p>
<p>The article describes college students dealing with depression who attempt suicide (which, by the way, is the number 2 cause of death of college students, claiming 1,100 lives a year).  The article starts out with the story of Ethan Helfand who tried to kill himself one night by overdosing on antidepressants (he had a history of depression and suicidal thoughts, reports Fowler).  When he woke up the next day in the university hospital, he was told he could not return to his dorm room and had to check into a hotel.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was going to post a follow-up blog about the Michael Richard's incident.  Apparently some comedy clubs in Los Angeles have started charging performers for each N-bomb they drop (one performer racked up a bill of just under $400 dollars).  Others have said "Come say the N-word here!  We support freedom of speech!"  But then I couldn't remember what I was going to write about, and the Kramer thing blew over, and so I decided against the post.</p>
<p>Then I was going to post about how adorable Brad Pitt's baby is, but decided not many people would find it exciting (I have an odd obsession with babies).  If you are interested, go <a href="http://www.people.com/people/gallery/0,,20004178,00.html">here</a> and fawn.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Hey everybody, just wanted to say goodbye with one last blog. All the smiles, the comments, the YouTube videos, I'll never forget them. In closing, I wanted to ask you all, why did you pick your blog name?</p>
<p><em>"He's a ghost, and he writes to us," or "How I picked my blog name"</em></p>
<p>For me, "ghostwriter" was inspired by my roommate's and my love for early 90s board games. Sitting on the shelf near my computer along with "The Babysitters Club Game" and "Tamagotchi: The Game" (yes, "Tamagotchi" exists as a board game), is the "Ghostwriter Mystery Game". For those of you who don't know, "Ghostwriter" was an awesome PBS show in the early - mid 90s. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jRPRs1jiKE">This</a> will explain everything. Anyway, I really liked this name because you get the 90s TV show reference and the reference to questions about authorship posed by the actual practice of ghostwriting.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In honor of the  awesome new video game I got yesterday ("X-men Legends II," yes!!) I thought I'd see what new games are coming out now (esp. since my game is already a year old. But I don't care because it's fun!). I came across two interesting ones that have religious themes. The first was "Left Behind: Eternal Forces," which is based on the "Left Behind" book series. From what I gather, it's premise is kind of similar to my X-men game. But instead of finding new mutants to join your fight against Apocalypse and his evil clone army, you're out recruiting and converting people in your fight against the Anti-Christ and non-believers. Critics of the game have described it as "a violent video game in which born-again Christians aim to convert or kill those who don't adhere to their extreme ideology." That's from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/fun.games/12/13/christian.game.contorversy.reut/index.html">this article</a> on cnn.com. One of the groups against the game is petitioning to have it removed from the shelfs at (where else) Walmart. In response the the critiques, the CEO of Left Behind Games, Inc. says that "The reality is that our game perpetuates prayer and worship and that there is no killing in the name of God". He then goes on to contradict this, saying that "There is killing of course, it is a video game. But the basis of the game is spiritual welfare". Ummm okay. I think I'll stick to X-men. Everyone can agree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_(comics)">Apocalypse</a> is a bad guy, especially when paired with evil clones.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Orlan also did a really cool (non-plastic-surgery-related) project where essentially inverted the filmmaking process. Instead of first making a movie, Orlan first made movie posters. She put them around Paris and people became confused when they couldn't find a theater where the supposed film was playing. She made a soundtrack from the (non-existent) movie, a DVD for movie, and even held a forum where famous actors, directors, and critics met and discussed the film! When I heard her talk about this project she hadn't yet actually gotten to the part where she makes the film because apparently she needs to find a producer, but maybe by now production is underway. I actually think it would be kind of neat if she just never makes the film and uses the project as a sort of critique of movie posters, DVDs, soundtracks and movie screenings. When are any of these things ever given a second thought?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In response to Snaggle Tooth = Social Suicide and Spinsterhood, I'd like bring up an artist who turns on its head this idea of having to look a certain way (and having to go through cosmetic dentistry or surgery or what have you to get there). I don't know if any of you have heard of Orlan but she's definitely one of the most provocative artists I know of. Her art is her face. She undergoes cosmetic operations to contort her face in ways that are completely foreign to the operations we usually encounter. For her, a nose job might make her nose enormous or she may try to copy the Roman nose. The surgery that stood out most to me when I got to see her give a lecture in LA last spring were two enormous implants, one at each temple (she had decorated them with glitter for the lecture). Orlan undergoes the entire operation while remaining conscious and even talking. She has the "performance" telecasted to select places around the world. The art is pretty gruesome to watch but that definitely is part of her point.</p>

<p>On that note I would like to take a moment to reflect on my short career as a blogger. While I have enjoyed the blog a lot more than I had originally anticipated, I hesitate to think that I would ever blog of my own volition. In terms of class discussion, I would so much rather blog than be writing reading response papers all the time like some classes require. There is just something about the blogging format that is more inviting than staring a blank word document.</p>

<p>Information Systems and Network Services recently gained information from the RTA's/LTA's that CMCNet has been less than stable. I would like to offer an explanation.</p>
<p>First and foremost, certain users are monopolizing the address availability on the wireless network. This leads to "limited or no connectivity" as described by many<br />
affected students. Our staff manually cleared close to 100 addresses this morning, so things are working properly at this point.</p>
<p>The next thing (and most important to keep in mind) are users that aggressively use "Peer-2-Peer" programs through the wireless network.  The wireless network was not built as a piracy hub, but rather an academic tool.  Performing these operations makes the central server less responsive for ALL who are connected. One user alone transferred over 19.6GB of bidirectional P2P data on the CMCNet wireless network yesterday.</p>
