    <div class="content"><p>Everyone seems to be talking about House of Leaves right now, and a lot of you have really interesting things to say, but the book messes with my head too much for me to have anything intelligent to say about it, so for the moment I will discuss something else entirely...</p>
<p>I have Net Flix and lately I haven't had time for movies, I mean since when do I actually have over an hour of concurrent free time that isn't sleep? So instead I've been getting lots of TV shows from them. The problem is I've burned through most of the Simpsons and all of the Futurama that they have, plus a couple of crazy anime series (Serial Experiments Lain fucked with my head in a way similar to House of Leaves), so I'm beginning to look more at live action TV series. I tried <em>Sex and the City</em>, can't stand it. <em>Desperate Housewives</em> was even worse. I hate cop/law dramas, so that counts a lot out, and unlike most people I know I hate both <em>Seinfeld</em> and <em>Friends</em>. I've been told I should try <em>Monk</em> and <em>House MD</em>, I've seen a few episodes randomly and they seem promising. But that's beside the point. Anyway, last night was one of my biggest strikeouts yet. I took Net Flix and a couple of my friends up on their suggestion that I try </em>Weeds</em>, thinking, "oh this will be fun, light-hearted, maybe even a little counter cultural". I made it through the first episode, put it back in its mailer and sent it back, the worst run of any series yet. I mean no offense to anyone who likes <em>Weeds</em> or any of the other of the aforementioned TV shows. Many people that I like and respect like at least one, if not more of them, I'm just really picky about TV. But I mean really!</p>
<p>The representations of race were so bad that I didn't even have time to be bothered by the fact that the show is clearly written and directed by individuals outside of the drug using/selling community, and their poor representation thereof hardly registered in comparison to the blatant racism. For those that don't know, <em>Weeds</em> is a Showtime(?) series that's set in a *very* wealthy suburb, the main character is a recently widowed White suburban mother of two boys, one aged somewhere between 7 and 10 and the other 15 years old. After the untimely death of her husband, we're given to assume, the widow has found herself in fiduciary peril and has taken to dealing pot on the side to her suburban neighbors. She buys her pot from a lower class, trash-talking, pie-baking, cornbread-loving, urban Black family, headed up by a maybe quasi-Caribbean (maybe not, hard to tell) matriarch who isn't far enough away from being the Aunt Jemimah of pot for my taste. Also a key member of the equation is one of the men in this family, an attractive young Black man, with whom the main character has already developed personal and sexual tension. I had no interest in seeing what would be said as that sub-plot was played out. Furthermore the main character employs a heavily accented, ambiguously Hispanic maid/nanny, who is in fact the only Hispanic to appear, at least in the first episode. The final person of color mentioned, to round out this diverse group, is the Asian American dentist's assistant (or something to that affect) with whom the father of the 15-year old's girlfriend and husband of the main character's PTA nemesis is having an affair. This is revealed in a conversation between the main character and one of her customers, which went something like this:</p>
<p>Customer: "...[in bad Asian accent] she love him long time...he said once, during sex she stuck a [something I didn't catch] up his ass, said it felt amazing, but if you ask me, any guy who lets anything up there is at least part fag..."<br />
Dealer: "...come on she's from [some clearly local town I didn't catch] not Bangkok, it's not like she's shooting ping pong balls out of her twat..."</p>
<p>Her response to his representation of Asians/Asian Americans left something to be desired and she offered no response to his use of the word "fag" or his clear homophobia. I was pretty much completely done with it by that point, but I decided to see it through. I was rewarded by getting to see the main character blackmail the schoolyard drug dealer, whom she has a problem with for selling to children, with her newly gained knowledge that he is gay and in a relationship with a much older man in the neighborhood. They, and their relationship, are represented as effeminate, frivolous and pedophilic. Then I got to watch her catching her 15 year old son having sex with his girlfriend, who at one point informs the main character that neither of them are virgins. As well as the younger son being suspended from school for emulating his favorite show, "Bear Hunt" which delivers exactly what the name promises, by donning camo and attacking his bully with a Super Soaker full of pink paint.</p>
<p>Although the racism was the most overwhelming thing wrong with this show, I was also bothered by the ways in which women were referred to, slut, twat, cunt, bitch, etc, being common. I was also rather shocked by the representation of teenage sex. I'm no prude about this. I certainly had friends who were having sex in middle school, my friend's 14-year-old brother is already having sex with his girlfriend, and my sister, a junior in high school knows plenty of kids who are. I'm not shocked by 15 year olds having sex, I'm surprised by how it's gotten into the media, albeit cable. I seem to recall that when I was a teen watching TV most of the representations were of the 16-18 crowd having agonizing debates between boyfriends and girlfriends, prolonged by the boys constant pressuring and the girls hedging and stalling. The girls that were having sex were definitely typified as "the sluts". What I saw in <em>Weeds</em> was a much younger age group a far more upfront approach. I am even more concerned than I ever was that these sort of things promote the sort of compulsory heterosexuality and just plain sexuality that most teens are faced with today. I feel that it ties back into an early discussion about ethics in television, if we are trying, as a nation, to fight teen pregnancy rates and STD/STIs among teens (and other age groups of course) what sort of message does this send to teens? It seems to me that media is telling them that they *should* be having sex, and specifically procreative, heterosexual sex, that they should not be distracted by the myriad other ways that they can sexually satisfy themselves and their partners but that they *should* be participating in exactly the kind of sexual behavior that makes them most vulnerable to pregnancy and STD/STIs. Don't get me wrong, I firmly support sex education in the schools, and am strongly opposed to abstinence only sex education. Clearly we need to face the fact that teenagers *will* have sex and the best thing we can do is make sure that they are as knowledgeable as possible in terms of the risks they face, and the most capable of having the safest sex possible.</p>
<p>I do understand that the show's purpose seems to be to expose the seedy underbelly of the suburbs, to expose all the dirt and scandal, to show that even in the perfectly planned community, full of rich, White people, things are fucked up. Maybe they think they're doing something to redress this by making it apparent, but if that's the case they aren't trying hard enough to make that clear. It seems to me that they're playing off the anxieties of The Middle, and profiting from the perfect soap-opera setting, the suburbs. The place where the rich and the White people had fled, to escape the infringement of the minorities and the homosexuals on their conservative values and traditional families, even to their bastion, the suburbs, the taint follows them. Nowhere is safe from these modern plagues. This show disturbed me deep down, and the last thing to stick with me, under the racism, the homophobia, the misogyny and everything else, was how mean everyone was to each other. I like to think that people have more humanity and treat each other with more decency than that. I know it's a soap opera (basically) and I know I'm an idealist. But I like to believe in representing better human beings than that. I know there's more bang for your buck in the cruel and the scandalous, but what is the cultural cost?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I agree with most of what you are saying... and yet I like all these things about weeds. So maybe I am a homophobic racist (not out of the realm of possibility), but I like that it is so overt and over-the-top about this stuff. The more episodes I watched, the more clearly I saw a some hidden wit in these overtly racist treatments and a slightly satirical bent to the show. The interactions between the stereotypical hispanic housekeepers and their employers are expecially gratifying in an obvious "i cant believe she said that" kind of way. And the racial tension between the suburbanite widow and her dealer family are made more serious than cornbread and grits talk. And other kinds of characters of these races are actually introduced.  I"m not saying that the show is subversive or socially conscious or even that you should ever watch it again, just that there's something to be said for a show that self-consciously (and at times satirically) uses stereotypes instead of pussyfooting around them.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by PureJaqassary on 7 October 2006 - 8:36pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I fully admit that one cannot get as comprehensive a view from just one episode as from watching the show over a series of episodes, so I can't argue with anything you've said. I don't even argue that the show isn't potential subversive, maybe it is. And I do agree with you that there is something to be said for facing stereotypes head on rather than tiptoeing around them, but that's a knife that cuts both ways, I remember having a discussion about Margret Cho's use of stereotypes in Jennifer Friedlander's Media Theory class last spring (a lot of people in this class were in that one too, so they know what I'm talking about) and the thing we (or atleast I) found most troubling is that, even though most, if not all, of us found Margret Cho hilarious, and recognized her use of stereotypes as satirical, there's no saying that there aren't some people laughing because they're thinking "oh my god, Asians are *so* like that!" I think the same could be said of Weeds. </p>
<p>I also think I'm more sensitive to stereotypical representations of minorities, and especially African Americans, because I'm from South Carolina originally. I feel that there racism is an issue that is more closely present in everyone's lives. Here, in California, I feel like people get away with feeling kind of distanced from racism, like it's someone else's problem, like it doesn't happen here. I think people get away with a lot more, in terms of ingrained racism here, because everyone is less on their gaurd for it. I'm not saying there isn't racism in South Carolina, lord knows there is plenty of it, but there are also *atleast* two people for every racist poised to jump down everyone's throat about it. People just can't help but be more aware of it as an issue. I also think I'm probably more sensitive to homophobic and heterosexist biases because I am a member of the queer community, and these things stand out more to me. I just feel that whether stereotypes are employed satirically or not, they have a lot of potential to harm, not only the group being stereotyped, but society at large.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by TheGoodConstable on 8 October 2006 - 10:39pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I started out to comment on this post with a slough of intelligent thoughts that would bring you to tears because you would realize how wrong you were. When I realized I wasn't capable of such things, I decided to do this instead.</p>
<p>So, I'm only going to pose one question. Is Weeds racist because it shows caricatures of individuals playing their stereotypical roles? You may disagree but stereotypes are based in SOME degree of truth. Not complete truth, but some. From your post, I see nothing wrong with Weeds (I've never actually seen the show). Is it not believeable that in a wealthy white neighborhood, the maid for a wealthy white family would be hispanic? Or that a family would enjoy trash-talking, pie-baking, and cornbread. I love all three of those things. So does everyone inmy family except my mom. She doesn't trash talk. And my brothers girlfriend won't eat cornbread.</p>
<p>you said when you were in middle school you knew people who were having sex, so why then is it inappropriate that in the show, 15 year olds are having sex. doesn't sound that implausible to me. And if 15 year olds were having sex, what are the odds that it's anything other than heterosexual, because at that age how many gay people have come out, and are furthermore having sex.</p>
<p>you said one of the problems with the show is that "the show is clearly written and directed by individuals outside of the drug using/selling community." n that regard, I doubt most drug dealers would correct someone for using the word faggot, or for that matter, call a woman anything other than a bitch, cunt, slut, etc.</p>
<p>Simply put, based on your comments, and your comments alone, Weeds is my favorite show.</p>
<p>by the way, i never got the sheet that matches the names with the codenames, so i have no idea who you are (meaning, nothing personal)</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by neurotica on 10 October 2006 - 12:16am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I haven't seen an episode of Weeds yet, so I'm just going to rant based only on what I've read on these posts. Too often people conflate commenting on the problematic nature of a work, in terms of representations of race, gender, etc., with the desire to censure it, or to denounce it as not worthwhile art. You can appreciate a show because it's cleverly written, or has a unique perspective, while still allowing the space to critique it. also, just because you're critiquing it doesn't mean you're saying any less about the craftsmanship, or saying that it shouldn't exist. one example for me, is robert mapplethorpes photographs of black men. i cannot deny that they are beautiful, but i also can't deny that i see the legacies of colonization and exploitation in that work. with media studies, i don't think the goal is to say what is good or bad, but to discuss what is being said at all.</p>
<p>back to weeds. i can see how the show may possibly be using these stereotypes to be subversive. however, i don't know how successful they are being. it is possible for a text to parody problematic notions in critique, yet only do it superficially. in the end, you can get your cake and eat it to, you get all the attraction of using stereotypes and what not, yet not get the criticisms. an example is this beer commercial i remember watching in intro to media studies. it was a stereotypical beer commercial, with men hanging out with scantily clad, attentive women giving them beer. this was shown to be nothing more than a fantasy sequence, and the commercial ends with the guys seeming like losers. Though in the end, the commercial subverted the normal gender scripts of such commercials, they were still able to profit from those scripts. i don't know. i'm not being particularly articulate. oh well.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by PureJaqassary on 19 October 2006 - 4:52pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Funny, my initial reaction to your comment was to unleash a deluge of critical analysis on you, which would bring <em>you</em> to tears because you would realize how wrong <em>you</em> are. Then I had to admit to myself that that really wouldnâ€™t be productive, nor are issues of representation often so simplistic as to be distilled down to a matter of right and wrong. Instead I will respond in what I hope will be a level and constructive manner to the questions you have raised. </p>
<p>The motivation behind racial (and other identity) representation in <em>Weeds</em> may very well be a complex matter, I can not say with any assurance that the representations of African Americans (and other minorities) come from a racist impulse, nor can I say that they do not. What I can say is that they can most certainly be <em>read</em> in a racist manner, which brings us back to questions of authorship and authorial intent, as well as the ethical responsibility of media creators to think seriously about the possible interpretations and social effects that their work might have. After all media is neither created nor consumed in a vacuum. </p>
<p>You seem to have mistaken the cause of my concern in most of my critiques of the show, so I will attempt to express myself with greater clarity. There is nothing wrong with liking cornbread, or pie, or a good trash-talking session, or even, when you get right down to it, certain types of drug dealing. I would not be concerned if the African American family were presented in exactly the same way, except that they were White, not because I donâ€™t think African Americans should receive greater representation on television, but because the problem is in how they are represented. To suggest that a White person might like cornbread does not carry the smallest portion of the cultural baggage attached to suggesting that an African American does. This is not to say that there arenâ€™t African Americans who do like cornbread, I know quite a few myself, but to have the only African American characters represented in such a stereotypical way is deeply problematic, as I would hope you would be able to see. Itâ€™s like Robin Lakoff says in her (otherwise very troubling) book on linguistics, â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong, obviously, with having a natural sense of rhythm; but to impute this quality, sight unseen, to <em>all</em> blacks [sic] and thus to each black [sic] in turn that one encounters is insultingâ€. Nor do I mean to suggest that it is unlikely that a rich woman in a rich neighborhood might employ a Hispanic maid. The trouble lies in the fact that these are the ONLY ways in which African Americans and Hispanics are represented in the show, they are given a very narrow set of identities to occupy, while the White characters are allowed a broad range of identities and their motivation arises from what we must assume are the charactersâ€™ <em>individual</em> personalities, rather than their racial identity. Furthermore, I take exception to your suggestions that all (or at least most) stereotypes are based on some grain of truth. Some may well be, and some may have been at some time, but generalization and time distance these stereotypes so much from reality that it is very dangerous to grant them the validity of truth. On the whole, I would have hoped that three years of education in Media Studies would have left you somewhat better prepared to engage with the complex nature of representations of race in media.</p>
<p>As for your response to the matter of the 15-year olds having sex, you will have to forgive me if I seem a bit short, as I found your comments personally offensive; although I must thank you for so brilliantly demonstrating compulsory heterosexuality and heteronormativity for us. But before I launch in to that, I would like to point out that I never said that I found their sexual activity â€œimplausibleâ€ only that I found the representation thereof to be an interesting social signal. But I must ask why you think that the odds are all that much more likely that if 15 year olds were having sex, they would be having heterosexual sex? If straight 15 year olds have already figured out that they are attracted to the opposite sex (provided that we accept a binary definition of sex and gender, which for the purpose of this discussion, we will), why does it seem so improbable that gay and lesbian youth are already well aware of their own preferences and that they might already be acting on them? My current girlfriend, for one, was out at 13 and had already accrued quite a bit of sexual experience with other girls, who were all also out lesbians of her age, by the time she was 15. I wonder if your conclusion was based on the assumption that gays and lesbians-to-be begin as straight and have straight sex in high school and then, later, realize that they are attracted to members of their own sex, or that gays and lesbians sexually mature at a later age, or perhaps some other logical fallacy that I have not yet guessed at. I certainly would be interested to know. Whatever your assumption, it is clearly motivated by a sense of heteronormativity, a cycle of which compulsory heterosexuality forms a key part. 15 year olds donâ€™t have to <em>decide</em> that theyâ€™re straight, they donâ€™t even have to <em>know</em> it, they just are, right? Except that, as I hope you would have already become aware by now, this is not at all the case. I think perhaps you might consider actually speaking to a number of gays and lesbians about their life experience before you make any more decisive statements about when they come out or become sexually active. After all, what exactly are you basing those assumptions on?</p>
<p>As for the matter of drug use/dealing, you again seem to have misunderstood my complaint. Iâ€™m sure that use of female and homosexual pejoratives like cunt or fag probably occur at roughly the same frequency and with the same distribution as they do in non-drug related social circles, my complaint about the use of those words was in fact unrelated to my complaint regarding representations of drug-related communities. I simply meant that the representation of drug dealers and drug users were wooden, stereotypical, and wholly unbelievable, at least to me. The writers seem to be operating on certain assumptions about â€œhow drug dealers talkâ€ and â€œhow drug users useâ€ that seem to have little relation to reality and a lot more relation to representations proliferated by anti-drug propaganda. I was merely suggesting that the writers might have considered doing some field research to lend their characters greater verisimilitude.</p>
