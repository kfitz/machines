    <div class="content"><p>It seems that over the past few months, we've seen a string of celebrities and public figures being (pretty much) dragged out the closet by the media. From Lance Bass, to Neil Patrick Harris, to various members of the Republican party, it seems that people are being outed left and right (pun intended). Although the speculation comes out (god, I can't stop with the puns) from different sources (i.e. Bill Maher's comments on CNN), much of it seems to be fueled by internet gossip (i.e. Neil Patrick Harris being outed on Perez Hilton's blog). </p>
<p>	I find the whole thing to be really fascinating, and I also find that I have mixed feelings about it, and was left with more questions than answers. Although I will admit to deriving a sense of glee when homophobic Republicans are outed as gay themselves (and in turn as hypocrites), I also think that coming out is a very personal decision and shouldn't be forced on someone. But then again, there is a need for more gay visibility in the public eye, but at what cost? It seems that with internet gossip, no aspect of a public figure's private life is off limits. Is a total lack of privacy now hand in hand with celebrity in our culture? Should these people be forced out of the closet? As public figures, do they owe it to the queer community to be out? Also, why are all of the recently outed people males?</p>
<p>What do <em>you</em> think?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I think it is important that people make their own decisions about when and how they come out.  While there is a need for gay visibility in the media, this visibility should be the choice of the actor/actress/director/whatever. Recently the actor T.R. Knight confirmed rumors that he was gay after another member of the Grey's Anatomy cast made some homophobic comments.  While T.R. came out on his own, the homophobic comments possibly pushed him into the decision. I don't know where I'm going with this, but basically I think people should talk about their sexuality when they are comfortable about it, not when they are uncomfortable because of rumors and homophobia.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Yeah, that reminds me of that post from a couple weeks ago about election day results being overshadowed by Britney Spears' divorce. It seems that news outfits are more interested into prying into the private lives of celebrities than looking at actual news.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by neurotica on 27 November 2006 - 1:59am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>in vietnam, queerness isn't something that's openly talked about, unless it's in a sensationalized seedy headline sort of thing. what interests me is that there's no celebrities that i know of that are publicly out. however, there are lots of singers and actors, that everyone would tell you is gay. if you ask them how, they say they just know, or they've heard it from the grapevine. I did research on queer related stuff in ho chi minh city this summer, and when I would ask my friends, who were shocked about my research and felt uncomfortable with the idea that some people in their neighborhood may be gay, they totally felt comfortable with gossipping on how these celebrities were gay. not might be gay...but that they were. these actors and singers, their work doesn't explicitly have to do with anything queer. for example, my mom gets squeamish when i talk about anything related to gayness, but she gets giddy at the chance to talk about all the gay cai luong (vietnamese folk opera) singers out there. What interested me is this idea that everyone knows for sure. I feel like we don't really have that here in western popular culture. There are some folks that people joke about, like Tom Cruise (i think he is, though i as a queer person don't want to claim it. let scientology keep him). however, it's not something wide spread that everyone thinks tom cruise is gay. Is this because we do have some celebrities who come out? Is it also because we have more gay roles? Does this lessen the need to have this elephant in the room syndrome, where everyone knows but no one openly talks about it? </p>
<p>on a related note, dam vinh huong had a new album out when i was there. though he hasn't done the whole press conference coming out, i wasn't completely right when i said he's not publically out. he has hidden notes, references, and meanings to his work. the newest album is called "liberation", obviously uses Brokeback Mountain imagery, including the back cover showing him and another guy riding off together. In the album  booklet, it had an image of a shirt tucked in another shirt. fun times. my mom likes dam vinh huong.</p>
