    <div class="content"><p>So I find myself up against 'the man' again. Only now I realize no good can come from continuing to avoid it, so now I am going to attempt to "get on it" as KFitz suggestedâ€¦ only I am not sure what to get on really. (Thus the basis of my reluctance to even start) I find myself again (in a very karmic way) with this dilemma of blogging, and my stubborn determination AGAINST it. I can whip up responses to readings and edit them and print them out and hand them in â€“ that I've been trained to get done, no problemâ€¦. But now we have moved beyond that teacher-paper-student connection and now it's something online, on a screen that is being published for the critical eyes of an entire whole class to see, and it's on the WORLDwide web so that's a new layer of publishingâ€¦ and hey, it seems I'm totally scared of authorship.  Whew, naming it is the first step to overcoming it, yea?<br />
So I've been thinking that a big reason for this fear of mine is that this theory stuff is mostly over my head. I can and do read it. My eyes go over the words, and some neurons fire in the old noodle, got that. And some times, I get the urge to underline some things that seem to be the big concepts that give off an impression of 'mattering' in some scheme of things. But then, from there? Hey, I did the assignment. I attempt to make meaning for me, myself, and Iâ€¦ But now I need to blog on that? And splat here is where I hit the brick wall. I could try to come up with a response for a prof to look over, but I know I'd wuss out and write how I was mostly confused by this, and here was the gist I thought so-and-so was working at.  But really, is the author dead? I don't entirely get it. Is this 'dead author' a woman? I found that I could vibe with that on a purely theoretical level, and relate to it but only in a sense of it being 'out there'. And reading/discussing the bell hooks made me realize the importance of the deep understanding that is necessary to process some of these concepts, and then to teach them. Because I feel like that is what is done with all this 'unpacking' (what a great, well used word in this case) and boiling-down, to blog and comment on. Because at this level, this 'senior seminar' level, 4 years of an undergrad liberal arts college edu-ma-cation behind us â€“ and I can't put together coherent, worthwhile thoughts on material that I am not really comfortable with? I don't know. Maybe I've been too adept at bullshitting my way through proving my shady comprehension thus far with everything. And I've been told how I see too much in black and white â€“ and I know that this is my case even more so once I realize it's a little over my head. Because as it seems to me, the dead author can't be a women because she has her whole own trajectory of authorship that needs to catch up on the rest of the literary scene. [Which is kind of bullshit to me, you know? I haven't taken any gender/feminist/ women's studies classes PER SEâ€¦. only, there is a huge undercurrent of these ideas in the film classes I have taken here at the 5cs. (wellâ€¦ Pitzer and Pomona, really.)]  And in reading this authorship and film book I find myself noticing parallels with this larger sense that so far, we are trying to fit square pegs in round holes too soon. These notions of authorship and film, I mean jeeze. Film is such a new medium compared to everything else we are trying to fit in context with (art, literature, all that jazz) â€“ it's been around what circa 100 years, with technological advances growing exponentially it might feel like longer. (* which reminds me, how I hate this feeling of things moving tooo too quickly. This was the basis of my first thoughts on blogging, but again I didn't feel up to sharing and authoring and publishing, because my ideas didn't seem to be that fleshed out. but newsflash, I get to author this how I choose, and recently I've been noticing my preferred, natural method of authoring is stream of consciousness. I apologize to everyone who hates this and can't follow along, and I especially hope this won't negatively influence anyone's feelings towards my intelligence, I promise I can be smart and put-together and coherent, if I really tryâ€¦ but as there is too much going on, there just aren't enough hours in the day, we'll have to work with this for the time being. Oh and back to that blog I never wrote, it was on how it seemed that things were getting out of whack/out of control/out of time. Such as blogging/online classroom forum discussion boards, trying to get a dialogue online and out of the class â€“ is that just a tool to help stimulate discussion during classtime? I don't get it, it seems like a way of getting to the actual root of things too quickly for me, as discourses in the real classroom take real time, not this crazy online time where things are getting more ridiculous, up-to-speed, live-action time in those scary ways. For example â€“ OH HOW I LOVE EXAMPLES, oh REAL CONCRETE EXAMPLES, yessss  - just look at the Facebook Newsfeed trying to capture the changes of every move as it went down exactly in real time, and how that turned out. I know there are other issues involved in there with privacy and all that, but I'm just saying. I don't like blogging for this general kind of reason: and in case you're not with me, that reason is how I can't make sense, and can't relay my thoughts well. But I am blaming technologyâ€¦ and maybe time, too.) With regards to authorship and ecriture feminine and postmodern blacknessâ€¦ for one reason or another (probably having to do with the cursed damned capitalistic patriarchy) these 'genres' or differences or what have you, they are on their own schedule of developing. Although it is simultaneously with this long-established system of oppression/dominance, etc â€“ I think to critically look at it with these parameters is ultimately frustrating and fruitless. And I guess it's cool trying to figure out how to fit them in this timeline that was previously reserved for old rich white men's literatureâ€¦ but that is also what frustrates me to no end. Yes, that can be a basis for a rich history of understanding societiesâ€¦ but at the same time, I felt my irony-detector going off with how these readings and articles seem to be defensive and almost upset against this unbalance â€“ this unfair matching-up, yet they still wholly partake in it. bell hooks arguing against academics sticking to their academia-speak, yet writing her thoughts about that in ways that I still needed to unpack. And Marchessault arguing on feminism in an open letter, but resorting to constant comparisons with the masculine theorists and such.  And I'm still kind of early in this Authorship and Film tome to start railing on that just yet, but I was picking up on some of itâ€¦ but hey. Deep down, I am counting on the fact that really, I am just projecting all of this on to these readings, anyway.<br />
Whew. That (almost) felt good.</p>
