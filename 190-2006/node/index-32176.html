    <div class="content"><p>After McCloud's perfect integration of form and content I can't help but be a bit frustrated by the fact that Murray's book is.. well.. a book. Comics were the most appropriate format for Understanding Comics and in turn, I feel Murray would have made an even more convincing argument if she had reread Hamlet on the Holodeck a few more times and made her point using a web-based format. As she puts it "some kinds of knowledge can be better represented in digital formats than they have been in print". I want her to show me this; to let me experience this for myself. If "by giving us greater control over different kinds of information, [computers] invite us to tackle more complex tasks and to ask new kinds of questions" show me this by presenting Hamlet on the Holodeck on an internet site that invites me to take on a more active role as "reader".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After having batted around my original thesis idea for a while I've dedided to go in a new direction entirely and I'm still sort of molding this thing into a coherent idea (and one that is focused enough for a thesis to boot). Basically, as long as my final thesis still deals with the Dalai Lama and media, I think I will be happy so give me any ideas you may have. Here's what I've got so far:</p>
<p>I have recently become fascinated with how America has helped to create the world's image of the Dalai Lama as well as the image portrayed to Tibetans who are far from their homeland due to persecution by the Chinese. Many have fled to India and others to Europe and America. I wonder if perhaps even the Dalai Lama's own self image has changed due to the multitudes of documentaries, Hollywood films, and books that have him as the star. I feel that the media force of Hollywood must have influence over perceptions of the Dalai Lama but I am still learning about the films, books, magazines and other media sources that may have done this.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>...here are some commercials!</p>
<p>I know, I know, the idea of voluntarily watching commercials doesn't seem that appealing (there are, of course, a few exceptions) but I'm writing my thesis on the Dove Real Beauty advertising campaign and I'd like to get some input from the class.  </p>
<p>A bit of background:<br />
Dove's Real Beauty campaign was launched in late 2004, and first caught people's attention with the infamous average-women-in-their-skivvies <a href="http://www.jeffpidgeon.com/uploaded_images/real%20women-789598.jpg">photo</a>.  The campaign is "intended to serve as a starting point for societal change and act as a catalyst for widening the definition and discussion of beauty" (Dove.com)  As I'm sure you'll realize by looking at the photo, the campaign is fighting the stereotypical size two model found in most advertising.  The campaign has grown quite rapidly and now has a series of commercials: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=L_aDpmfAzxI">here</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=gUsKIApTewQ">here</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AOLfyUcYfpo">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In response to Ghostwriters blog about online television.  </p>
<p>This is specifically in reference to the NBC and ABC shows that are being broadcast online.  I have gone to these network websites for a little late night Grey's or Lost action.  I think it is great that they broadcast these and can see that this is the direction television seems to be heading. (last year when they first announced the broadcasts I was beyond stocked.)<br />
The other day I looked at this graph which predicted the growth of internet use for daily tasks such as shopping, television watching and so on.  It showed that this growth has been exponential for the last several years.  It is however predicted that within the next 10 years there will be a major surge.  This isn't surprising, it is actually very obvious but it was still an interesting graph to look at.  Everyday people are growing more comfortable with the internet, but we still get a skewed view of this trend because we are in a young tech-savvy college environment.  Once American citizens as a whole reach a point of comfort with the internet, use for every day activities is predicted to surge because of a snowball effect.  If you neighbor is using the internet to buy their groceries and it is turning out well for them, suddenly you may jump on board.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Considering that this book was released in 1997, I find it amazing how relevant and precise many of Murray's predictions are. I mean, honestly, in terms of technology and the advancements of the internet, 1997 was forever ago and she definitely had a strong sense of the direction that television and the internet were going. While I agree with what other people have been commenting about the fact that the book is outdated and many parts are insignificant, I actually enjoyed the fact that the book was 10 years old.  It was interesting to examine what she had written and see if her predictions were fulfilled or not. For example, she talks about how interesting it would be to have interactive, online sets for television programs where the audience could learn more about the show or the characters. While maybe this hasn't particularly happened in cyberspace (although I'm sure there are some cases), I know that almost every DVD that is released has extra features where the interested viewers can have an interactive part in deciding what else they would like to know about the set and characters and in some cases, even the plot. Best example of this being DVD's (of both film and television programs) where viewers can choose alternate endings or alternate scenarios in the DVD's, such as X-Men 3, where the DVD special features include multiple alternate endings, the ability to play the DVD with commentary to gain a larger insight into the film, character profiles, etc... Basically, the viewer can have an active part in deciding how they want to view the film. Not only is this available on the DVD itself, but typically similar things are shown on film or television websites, as well as public internet spaces, such as youtube and myspace.</p>

<p>Secondly, I'd like to just note how "awesomeness" is now one of the popular tags. It took a while, but I finally got it to appear on the tag list. So if you're ever in dire need of perusing my less-than-extensive blog history, then "awesomeness" is the place for you. Also, though, I welcome more awesomeness on the blog from other awesome people. Let's get the awesomeness abounding.</p>
<p>And finally, the meat. I am a big fan of William Faulkner - even though I've only read Light in August and The Sound and The Fury.</p>

Nintendo is releasing their newest video game platform in only a few weeks which is seeking to revolutionize the industry.

    <div class="content"><p>Overall, I enjoyed Hamlet on the Holodeck.  Murray has a clear and effective writing style that kept me entertained, and she made some clever and relatable references, from Einstein's Dreams and Brave New World to the computer game Myst and the Star Tours ride at Disneyland.  But even though the writing is brilliant, a part of me felt like it's somewhat out-of-date.  So much has changed since this book was published in 1997.  Now, almost 10 years later, chat rooms have gone out of style and dial-up connections are becoming obsolete.  At the time that Murray wrote this text, social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace had not yet risen onto the scene.  Napster had not been taken to court, and television episodes had not yet been sold for $1.99 on iTunes.  I'm curious to see what Murray would say about all of these occurrences.  It seems that she considers the Internet to be a utopia of free exchange (at least at the time that she wrote this book), and I'd be interested to see what she thinks about the issue of copyright violations on the Web, how this might change in the future, etc.  Also, she mentions that the Internet allows everyone to tell his or her story through family albums, journals, homepages, and the like, all of which are "pushing digital narrative closer to the mainstream" (252).  Today, the majority of the people I know have published information about themselves on the web, whether through MySpace, Flickr, Xanga, Livejournal, or similar sites.  But these don't allow for as much innovation in representation as (I think) Murray anticipated.  Their prepackaged formulas for display make personal information somewhat impersonal.  Even when you choose a different background for your Blogger or plug in a code to change the look of your MySpace, it's all very prepackaged and unoriginal.  So although digital narrative has become mainstream, just as Murray predicted, it hasn't taken on a very innovative or immersive form.  But who knows... perhaps this will change in the future, as technologies improve and people become even more comfortable interacting with and manipulating the digital world.</p>
