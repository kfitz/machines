    <div class="content"><p>So I just got back from the most entertaining conversation at dinner. Well, it was necessarily entertaining, but it really was thought-provoking and involved three members of our Seminar and one Philosophy major. It started when I referred to the person who will be living next door to me next semester as a "rando", short for "random person" since it was not by our design that he will be living there. This word was not my own invention, but it is one of my favorites and thus I use it as much as humanly possible. We then collectively realized that this is a trend in our contemporary culture - shortening words from their original forms, as in "poss" for "possibly"; "whatevs" for "whatever"; "sitch" for "situation"; "probs" for "probably"; and I have no idea how to even begin spelling the modification for "usual" but I'm pretty sure you know what it sounds like.</p>
<p>We Media Studies majors thought this was a pretty cool phenomenon (even though I admit to thinking "poss" was absolutely ridiculous the first time I heard it), but the Philoph major called it a "perversion" of the English language. He thought it was a sign that we were simplifying our thoughts and becoming more incapable of expressing ourselves as a culture. Proper English, to him, has some sort of inherent ability for communication and as such should be what we all strive to speak.</p>
<p>Our first contention was that words are merely signifiers of thoughts, feelings or things, and that if the word changes, then the thing it represents doesn't necessarily change along with it, and certainly isn't devalued in any way. He either couldn't seem to grasp this concept or just simply disagreed with it, and I think it flies directly in the face of his "Proper English" theory and as such, was not directly rebutted.</p>
<p>The other thing we brought up was that slang and other methods of linguistic modification are examples of marginalized people exercising agency in the construction of their own cultural acceptance. Rather than allow themselves to be ostracized by the dominant culture, they create an atmosphere in which their form of language is the dominant or accepted one. Through this proactive manner, we collectively continue to adapt our language to best fit the needs of the population that speaks it. </p>
<p>However, the examples above that are specifically for shortening words from their original forms don't exactly stem from a "marginalized people". It was my contention, though, that they represent a generational gap between our generation and all older ones when it comes to familiarity with digital media. I know that earlier today I revised my sentiment to say that I didn't think the generation gap was as big as I had first imagined. Well, I'm un-vising that thought. Verbal word shortening arises from the digital word shortening in which we all engage when we're talking to people online, either through an instant messenger of some kind or in a chat room or forum. Our generation's comfort level with acronyms and substituted word forms is, I would postulate, unparalleled in history in that we can communicate entirely through non-words if we so choose. Granted this doesn't work for massive treatises such as this one, but in most everyday speech, it does work. Our way, then, of differentiating ourselves from those who we perceive as being less competent with our social realm, but still asserting themselves as dominant in it, is to create a language unto our own through which they will not be able to communicate. It is natural that this would appear in our daily speech, as well, since it is so pervasive in the world in which we spend a large portion of our time.</p>
<p>I don't know if you all buy this, but I hope that at least someone made it to the bottom of this blog entry and has some sort of thought on the whole phenomenon. My friend thought it was something that we as a generation would grow out of, and we probably will, but I don't think that detracts from its import as a cultural tool. Thoughts?</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-525" class="active">Yeah, it was an interesting</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by ghostwriter on 13 December 2006 - 4:02pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Yeah, it was an interesting conversation. I felt that he had a pretty essentialist view of standard english, like it's the be all and end all of communication. It's one thing to say that in general people need standard english to get ahead in this society because  it is the status quo. However, it's an entirely different thing to say that people should speak standard english because it is "the best". As BuildingsAndFood was saying, language (and its modification) can serve really important uses for people from marginalized groups. It's important to consider the ways in which the government has historically promoted standard language at the (often violent) expense of other languages. From the slavery of blacks, to "Indian Schools," and beyond, standard english has often been used not just as a means of communication but as a means of colonization. </p>
<p>People from marginalized groups often have to engage in "code-switching," switching into and out of the dominant language depending on the situation, something that people from the dominant culture don't have to worry about. They expect that other people will change to be understandable to them, not the other way around. That being said, the overall point is that I don't think the conversations I may have in non-standard english, say with other black folks or queer folks is any less than a conversation in standard english, like the one we had last night.</p>
<p>I could say a lot more about this, but the moral of the story is that the MS majors won the debate (thanks in large to neurotica) :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>the debate was a tag team affair! I guess my issue with the notion of holding up "standard english" as the end all be all of communication, besides the very good points that ghostwriter and buildingsandfoods brought up, is that it seems like it's just glorifying the past, creating this false fantasy of a better bygone era where people communicated better. the past was not better, it wasn't worse, it's just different. the shortening of words and slangs does change the language, but perhaps these things arise because there's a need for it. language is evolving, and that should be embraced. it's not to say we should forget about the roots of language. words are significant and it's important to know their history, former meanings, etc. What are words used for? to signify meaning, to communicate? if i could still communicate meaning through using lol or slang, that doesn't make it less valid.</p>
<p>one example that i always think about is this one incident that happened when i was abroad. in the english speaking part of cameroon, the lingua franca is a pidgin english that is a mix of english, and a lot of the local languages. i went to this induction ceremony for new peace corps volunteers. one new volunteer did his speech in pidgin english. afterwards, my friend and i went up to him and complimented him. he said something to the extent<br />
guy: "thanks. pidgin's a simple language"<br />
us: "what?"<br />
guy: "it's not the kind of language you can express yourself in. it's not like you can talk about political matters or express emotion"<br />
us: "uh.....how long have you learned pidgin?"<br />
guy: "two weeks".</p>
<p>garggg!!!! pidgin may be considered a "perversion" of the english language, but people use it to converse everyday, discussing incredibley complicated, complex, important issues. just because you can't express yourself, it doesn't mean that the language itself is not valid.</p>
