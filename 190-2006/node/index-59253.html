<p>While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but notice the blatant use of product placement as is typical of so many movies made these days.  But there was one instance in particular that had me a little upset.  One scene features James Bond driving a new Ford coupe while on a mission in the Bahamas.  James Bond driving a Ford? Come on! Thankfully, it is just a rental car until he has the time to get his hands on a far more Bond-appropriate car, a vintage Aston Martin.  Nevertheless, I couldn't help but wonder how much Ford had to pay to get Daniel Craig behind the wheel. So I did a little research--</p>

<p>This was posted on my friend's blog, with encouragement to re-post and share.  This UCLA student did not have his student ID at the library, so told UCPD he was leaving.  However, on his way out he was tasered mercilessly and continuously.  The event was captured on a cellphone camera and posted onto YouTube.</p>
<p>The video isn't that great, but I think it's really interesting how cellphone cameras and YouTube are suddenly together fighting for social and civil liberties.  It calls to mind Rodney King, but rather than needing the mass media to distribute the video to the public, the public is able to do it quickly and easily without the help of television or news corporations.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Like my previous blog, this one was also sparked by my Digital Art class (yay for class overlap!). We had a visiting artist last week who did a lecture about his work, which includes elements from LARPs (Live Action Roleplaying, like we talked about with "First Person"). Although this presentation was astoundingly boring, he did talk about how LARPs are evolving beyond the fantasy/sci-fi genre. He briefly touched on Colonial Williamsburg, which intrigued me because it seemed like a very problematic premise, like living out a colonial fantasy. I went to their website to find out more, and it turns out it's a lot more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Anyway, in my Digital Art class we've been working with sound, basically cutting up sounds that we've found or made and mixing them into something new. On Thursday, the prof showed us a couple of YouTube videos by this Norwegian guy name Lasse Gjertsen, who does a similar thing but with sound <em>and</em> video (oooh). The two we watched were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1worZARu-I">Amateur</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCTyEXOnQ-g">Hyperactive</a>.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Simultaneously one of the funniest and more important articles that I have read in a while: Business week's "Hip Hop two-step over product placement." First off, it includes a photo of one the whiter shade of pale kind of middle-aged man who freely admits to knowing little to nothing about hip hop music, saying he's more of a "Van Morrison/Eric Clapton kind of guy." But the article includes snipets of an interview with Russell Simmons, hip hop impressario extraordinaire, who is talking about a deal with McDonalds to pay hip hop and rap artists for including things like "Big Mac" in their lyrics. but he says the deal might not work unless listeners are unaware of said agreement. In other words, Micky D's is uninterested in publicity that is not sneaky and underhanded. Simmons had the idea to instead produce songs in which rappers would rap about how mcdonald's wants to throw money at them to reposition their brand and thus create a criticism of the exploitation of hip hop culture and also corruption in adversiting. But then wasn't it simmons that brokered the deal for P. Diddy to pen "Pass the Courvosier" to reposition that brand? The whole thing seems pretty tricky to me. I may just be naive and optimistic, but I usually figure even commercial artist aren't always just plugging a product. I'm not saying creative advertising has no place, I just think it would be too bad if art was reduced to a series of commercials. As David Kiley characterizes hip hop, I just want it to return to "a lot of lyrics about bling and money."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Gwen Stefani's new promo pictures came out yesterday, they feature a portrait of Stefani crying. Anyhow, the artist/photographer reponsible, Jill Greenberg (the manipulator) was recently accused of tormenting the children she also photographed in crying portraits for her latest exhibit, End Times. She says she only took a lollipop away form them. Anyhow, I took a look at at her work...and was suitably impressed. The way she captured the genuine sadness and almost agony in the children from supposedly simply having a candy taken away is amazing. I took a look at Gwen's promo pic for "Sweet Escape" and found that much of what I had liked about her exibition work with the children was lost, and that the promo shot turned into a contived piece for publicity. Its still beautiful...just not authentic. But good for her, i'm sure she got good money for it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Not to be predictable, but Melting Pot wasn't really my favorite movie. It did make me uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, I do believe there is great value in being disturbed. I just sometimes wonder how effective things like that are. I mean I feel like I'm pretty sensitive to racial stuff and pretty aware of white hegemonies and stuff like that. In my case he's kinda preaching to the choir, and making me uncomfortable in the process, so not so effective on that level. And then what about the people who aren't already in the proverbial choir? How likely are they to watch a film called Melting Pot or RACE? I'm just not sure what the goal of that film was.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Hey everybody! I'm going to tell you about one of my favorite websites! This is i-am-asian.com. Guess what? It's a website for McDonalds! That's right, they trademarked asserting one's asian identity as a marketing strategy!</p>
<p>I found out about this site a few years ago, when I went to the Tet (Lunar New year for Viet folks like me) festival in Little Saigon, which McDonalds helped sponsor. I was given a goodie bag that had the website on it. Inside, I got a flyer telling me about how Mulan 2 was coming out soon on DVD. Anyways, i was blown away by the website. When I first logged on, automatically playing in the background was the jingle "ba ba ba ba I'm lovin' it", accompanied by a slide show with different images of asian-americans, including a photo of a dog wearing an I-Am-Asian.com t-shirt. There was a welcoming paragraph that said something to the extent of how Asian-Americans juggle two cultures and are proud of both, and how you're just as likely to celebrate the customs of your country as going out for a big mac (i'm not kidding). the website also had a section about different asian countries, their cultures, holidays, etc. There was also a section about different asian-americans who had prominent jobs in the mcdonalds corporation. Now I feel empowered!!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Overall, I thought Melting Pot was a great film.  But I'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty details here... I just want to touch upon some issues of authorship.  So Rusca directed this movie and also wrote it, but as we've discussed in class, authorship in film is a sticky subject.  As we saw during the credits, which seemed to go on forever, hundreds of people went into the making of this movie (even though it was independent, low-budget, and made under some serious time constraints).  Still, it seems to me that Rusca is pretty much the primary author... or is author even the appropriate term here?  He definitely created the concept and oversaw its implementation, but he also mentioned that he checked with Latinos and blacks from communities in Los Angeles to confirm and fine-tune certain aspects of the screenplay.  If these people helped shape the film in any way, shape, or form, does that make them secondary authors?  Can a project as big as a full-length film ever have a sole author, anyway?  Just some things to think about...</p>
