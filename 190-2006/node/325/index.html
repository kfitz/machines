  <div class="content"><p>Advertising definitely turns me off, especially the extremes  advertising agencies go to now, and the success they have with them.  But any mass manipulation media can cause for the worse, it can also cause for the better.  Anything in the art or activist realm of media studies is appealing to me, but it loses its appeal once it begins to get dictated by what will sell</p>

  <div class="content"><p>While many production oriented media studies jobs can be bent to a creative and activist will (though the effort may be exhausting and ultimately defeating) I don't think advertising is one of them. Atleast not advertising as it exists right now. No, I don't think it's ethical. You can try to do it in the most ethical way possible, but I don't know how far that'll get you. I think the problem with being critical media studies trained in the advertising field is that you will have to do everything fully consciously. You'll have to know that you are exploiting the anxieties and insecurities of teenage girls not "trying to offer them a way to feel better about themselves" by consuming the product you're selling. You'll have to know you're fetishizing, exploiting and objectifying women and minorities everytime you do it. You'll have to acknowledge all of that. Maybe there are niches in advertising where you don't have to do as much of it. And I'm not saying you shouldn't consider it as a career path, I'm just saying you should think very seriously about whether you're willing to work for the consumer capitalist machine. Sorry if that's a little doom and gloom, but personally I hate advertising and the more effective it is, the more I hate it, but I could never be content to produce mediocre work, so persoanlly, I'd find myself in a double bind. </p>
<p>But this isn't about my ethics, it's about your's. I guess the question is, do YOU think advertising is ethical. Cuz if you're going to hate yourself for doing it, I say find something else. You could do webdesign. It would be marketing without having to be advertising. Graphic design can be totally chill. Maybe think about that?</p>

<p>good god. I mean, there are ads for things like dog food also. Or for Jell-O pudding pops. Honestly there are a multitude of products and services that can be advertisedwithout murdering babies or forcing puppies to overdose on drugs.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to yell (I was yelling that whole time).</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by DaLynziiChic on 31 October 2006 - 2:17am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I saw an ad the other day for some health insurance company that depicted people helping eachother.  It made me feel good about myself and the human condition. </p>
<p>Also, there's a great car commercial where these pigeons try to poop on the car but then fly into the garage door.  This also makes me feel good about myself.  The song "Danger Zone" plays in the background, which is great.</p>
<p>I suppose if we really worked on it we could conclude that the pigeons signify Kamikaze Pilots reminiscent of WWII and therefore add to a negative depiction of Asians.  We could see the poop as the blemishes of immigration on our shiny, new VW Jetta Country.  But we don't, because that is crazy.  It is some birds trying to poop on a car that plays on the subtext of TOP GUN.  Birds actively try to poop on my car all the time, and I hate it.  Good advertising.  End story.</p>
<p>For once I guess I am supporting Clay, even though he said I was stingy with the book (when really it's his own fault that he is illiterate).  While I agree that some advertising may be seen as unethical for successfully understanding and manipulating human psychology, that doesn't mean that advertising is inherently evil.  A good deal of the government is corrupt, but that doesn't mean we'd be better off without it.  There is some good that comes of such institutions, like bird poop commercials.  Viva.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>It sounds like you're not so into feeding the consumer capitalist machine. My guess is a lot of media studies majors (actually, a lot of Pomona College humanities majors in general) feel this way. My question is, if you're planning on making any money at all, even just a little bit so you can, you know, eat, how is it that you are planning to avoid this?</p>
