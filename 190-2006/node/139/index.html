    <div class="content"><p>I want to preface this by saying that I think that our country's stance on the matter of illegal substances is terribly misguided, I think that DARE does a lot more damage than good, and that the FDA and DEA are clearly more interested in regulating private citizen's personal morality on the basis of a highly conservative, fundamentalist Christian-oriented, and over-all misinformed perception of the dissemination, use, and effects of most so-called "narcotics" and controlled substances than in the protection of the citizenry. The FDA is a powerhouse of hegemonic regulation of "controlled substances", not only does it directly control what substances can and can not be legally sold and how and in what quantities, etc. but it also controls what sort of research can be done on controlled substances. You can't research their effects without obtaining the substance and you can not legally and ethically obtain it for a viable research experiment without going through the FDA, which categorically refuses to give clearance or supplies to any proposed research with the intent or potential to disprove the governmental and departmental stance on controlled substances. They not only control the substances but the knowledge that can be generated in regards to them.</p>
<p>*pant pant* My desultory diatribe on drug regulation in this country now out of the way, on to the matter of Cocaine: Energy Drink....</p>
<p>My opposition is two-foldâ€¦well many-fold, but with two basic groupingsâ€¦the first is in regard to the amount of caffeine contained in this drink. Provided that the FDA considers most stimulants worthy of regulation, and provided that they are going to continue regulating them, I feel that it is high time that this regulation extended to caffeine. (Erowid considers caffeine a substance worthy of categorization in their vaults, and I give Erowid a lot more credit for knowing what's what in the drug using community than either the DEA or the FDA). As has been said elsewhere on this blog, though caffeine may not have the intensity of effect that cocaine does, nor as troublesome a means of production, it is nevertheless a habit-forming stimulant, which can be lethal in large doses and for those with sensitivities. Furthermore, the cultural whitewashing of caffeine dependency/addiction (not to mention of alcohol abuse, but that's another story) has become unacceptable. Caffeine is in a wide range of consumer goods and it often occurs in excessive quantities. (For example: I'm not sure if it's urban legend or not, but I'm sure a lot of you have heard that Starbucks adds caffeine to their coffee. I don't have proof, but it wouldn't surprise me if they did.) We have a cultural stimulant addiction, which manifests in many ways, most pervasively in caffeine use. The most troubling element of this pervasiveness is the acceptability of marketing caffeine-heavy products to younger and younger children, as well as the concomitant problem of parents permitting higher and higher caffeine (and sugar) intake among their children. People often remark on the rising occurrence of ADD/ADHD spectrum disorders in children. Part of this is no doubt due to the psychological popularity of the diagnosis. However, I am of the opinion that a large amount the ADD/ADHD behaviors undeniably exhibited by disturbing numbers of small children could be curbed if only parents would A) establish and maintain firm boundaries and behavioral expectations for their children, B) not use the TV as a babysitter and C) not let them consume so much caffeine and sugar! Instead of pumping your kid full of further stimulants (i.e. Adderall and Ritalin, which older kids quickly learn the street value of) why not just stop them pounding down endless Frappachinos and so-called "energy" drinks!?</p>
<p>My second issue is with the way in which the marketers of Cocaine: Energy Drink are camping on the cool of hard drug--and specifically cocaine--use. The problem with this goes both ways. Not only is it questionable from a ethical point of view to profit from the pre-existing "street-cred" of drug use, but, more troubling to me, the use of Cocaine as a marketing tool reinforces it's "coolness" from a more culturally legitimate sector. For all they say they don't advocate drug use, the company's choice to use it as a marketing device sends the message that it "must be cool" otherwise, why would they use it as a marketing tool? While the name may encourage drug users and those who think drug use is cool to buy the beverage, it also encourages younger consumers who buy the beverage to think drug use is cool. I don't think that the marketers can be entirely ignorant of the potential social repercussions of their choice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel that the choice of "Cocaine" in particular is a distinctly insensitive one, for a few reasons. First of all the cocaine trade is built on the exploitation of poor laborers in third world countries. These laborers work under inhumane conditions, both in terms of the violence and promise of violence inherent in their trade and also due to the tissue deterioration that results from the constant contact they must have with increasingly concentrated coca. The cocaine trade enriches brutal drug cartels, which do as much, if not more, to violate human rights in the cocaine producing countries as the governments do. Secondly, as a friend of recovering and recovered stimulant addicts, the marketing shows no sensitivity to their position. How do you think a recovered cocaine addict must feel to walk into a grocery store and be confronted with a can emblazoned with the name COCAINE that promises a euphoric rush with no crash? Previously it was only recovering alcoholics who were faced constant marketing pressure to drink, I do not view the extension of this pressure to other addictive substances as a positive one.</p>
<p>Mostly I am disturbed by this marketing campaign because it illustrates, very clearly, the extent to which corporate responsibility and ethics are a joke in this country. It doesn't even seem to occur to people that perhaps companies should be concerned with something other than their own bottom line; that as corporate citizens, with very real cultural clout, they have a responsibility to consider the social implications of their decisions and to act responsibly. I refuse to believe that our current consumer capitalist structure is an unavoidable, necessary evil. That it has always been this way, and must continue to be, if life as we know it is to continue. It has not always been and does not need to continue to be. We must do our best to see around the hegemonic controls that it exerts over us and envision change.</p>
