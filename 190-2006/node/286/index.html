<p>Sophia Lamar has beef with fellow gender benders Amanda Lepore and Jefree Star</p>
<p>Sophia Lamar (born Enrique MuÃ±oz in 1955 in Castro's Cuba) has long been a fixture of New York Night Life, starting off with Michael Alig and the original Club Kids, and now a fixture at Misshapes. She also has a weekly outlet to air her thoughts in Johnny McGovern's Gay Pimpin' podcast, where her popular segment "What Sophia Lamar Hates" ends each episode.</p>
<p>Sophia charged MySpace "e-celebrity" Jeffree Star with ripping her off. Sophia Lamar is the muse of fashion design collective Ok Citizen's Society which years ago created a shirt with the phrase "Sophia Lamar Will Kill You", and since then Sophia has adopted the phrase for her official website http://www.sophialamarwillkillyou.com. Well it seems Jeffree Star has started selling his own version of the shirt (seen here) with the phrase "Jeffree Star Will Kill You". Sophia noted how her shirt is sold in boutiques all across the world, and his is sold on myspace. She says his use of the phrase is like her saying "That's hot" or "You're Fired".</p>
<p>She also says of his song named after Louis Vuitton, "Louis is rolling in his grave, Jeffree trust me if he was alive he wouldn't want any thing to do with you...I'm sick and tired of talentless faggots stealing ideas...I want everybody to send emails to this faggot and tell him Shame! Shame! Shame!"<br />
His address his Jeffreeee@gmail.com</p>
<p>She also has an ongoing feud with former friend Amanda Lepore. Amanda and Sophia successfully sued nightclub Twilo in the 90's for firing them because they were transgender, since then Sophia has made a few claims that Amanda didn't play fair in business, and takes aim at her use of the phrase "#1 Transexual In The World", saying "I don't have a number because I never went to that contest...You can say you are the number one user of Crisco in the world and no body would argue with you, that contest where that tranny won the number one, she was the audience, the judges, she was even the security because everything was held in her apartment...[on the list of most famous transgendered people] no body is their because they take clothes off in night club because they people are there because they are curing cancer in India or become prime minister..."</p>
<p>However Sophia and Amanda still can be found on the same party invites.</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>I read this article on Oh No They Didn't! which is an online livejournal community dedicated to celebrity gossip.</p>
<p>I found two things about this article particularly interesting. </p>
<p>First, I found it interesting that Sophia Lamar alluded to the fact that anything related to Jeffree Star (an internet "celebrity" from MYspace) was not worthy of recognition because his celebrity began in the Internet. This made me think of debate over high art v. low art and whether one is really better than the other. Sophia said that she was the original user of the t-shirt phrase "Sophia Lamar will kill you" and that Jeffree was a cheap internet knock off below the radar of her boutique store brand. I wonder if you can even make that comparison fairly. I would venture to say that both are celebrities to an extent, just simply in differnt mediums. Neither one inherently better than the other. I think its obviously a case of the culture capital we as a society give to the internet v. real life. Real life isnt neccessarily better, its just different. </p>
<p>I also feel that there are matters of identity creation at play here that Sophia is alluding too. She feels that she is the "real deal" because shes been around long before the days of the internet, and Jeffree is still really just an internet "star." Well, a myspace "star", even beyond that simply a star to those who know about him. The samae can maybe even be said about Sophia. Both have a cult following in their own mediums, Jeffree online in Myspace and Sophia in real life in the LGBT world and hipster scene. </p>
<p>Its also ironic that Sophia seems to devalue Jeffree's recent status seeing that she is also taking advantage of the internet to expose herself to another fan base she would otherwise might now reach. I understand that its a matter of her using the internet to boost herself to another image, but what happens when the people that know her through the internet simply know her through that medium? Doesnt she then become one and the same with Jeffree who only has his idenity in an internet world? </p>
<p>It seems to me, that Sophia is simply upset that Jeffree stole her trademark saying on a t-shrt idea. Which is fair. But I disagree with her saying that Jeffree is a lesser version of her  when really all Jeffree is a a comepletely different kind of "star."</p>
