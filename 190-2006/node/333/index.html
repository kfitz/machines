    <div class="content"><p>Tonight I called my mom and dad up for our usual Sunday Night Chat where they ask me about classes and belie their golf scores.  I was in the middle of "First Person" and realized what a neat resource my mom was to talk about such things.  While she doesn't care about postmodern blahdeeblah, she adds an interesting perspective from the creative side of narratives.</p>
<p>My mom used to write for television, most noteably for MATLOCK.  She also wrote for WONDERWOMAN, HAWAII Five-O, and THE NEW TWILIGHT ZONE.  <a />MOM IS COOL.</a>  Now she writes for Nancy Drew computer games at a small, Bellevue-based company, "HerInteractive".  I asked her what she thought about the switch from TV to computer, and also a few other things I thought pertained to the reading.</p>
<p>First of all, Mom says that mechanically, writing for a computer game is not much different from television.  If you are unfamiliar with Nancy Drew computer games, they involve a "mystery" that the player (the embodiment of Nancy Drew) must uncover.  It always involves different scenarios and locations but Nancy Drew, along with her friends (Beth, George, and Ned...who are never seen, only heard on the phone for help and hints) remain the same.  Mom says she writes out the basic story, only there have to be about 3 different ways to get to the same ending.  The dialogue between characters (Nancy interrogates people) is very important in moving the scene along, and when there isn't another character Nancy often talks to herself.  Production-wise it's very similar to a TV show, with writers, actors (voice talent), art departments, producers, etc.  </p>
<p>The user puts herself in the shoes of Nancy Drew.  Mom has stressed that it's VERY IMPORTANT to the company that Nancy is never seen or given a sure identity.  They want the player to identify with Nancy no matter what gender, race, or age.  Interestingly enough, however, they recently have made a few games in which Nancy works with the Hardy Boys.  The Hardy Boys ARE given an identity (white stereotypical males) and I remember Mom was pretty disappointed with that.  In the newest game the player will be allowed to "swap" identities and move between Nancy and the Hardy Boys via a phone, so that the two work together to solve the mystery.  I asked if she was afraid this would alienate the players who so strongly identified with Nancy.  She responded that most of the feedback they had received so far was very positive.  The game is geared toward women -- their largest audience is teenage girls, although many older women are big fans.  Mom says that if the game were originally targeted at men (boys) she could see a problem with "swapping" to a feminine identity, but that women seemed to really enjoy "crossing over".  </p>
<p>Although the game requires the user to think and uncover the mysteries, it doesn't allow for much agency that could change the plot of the game.  Nancy can only do so many things, as indicated by a magnifying glass that appears in place of the mouse when you roll over a clue.  There is a very specific script for everything.  However, the user can move around as much as she wants and take her time with everything, solving some clues before others.  Nancy herself is a very scripted character who subscribes to All-American values and is, as Mom put it, a "goody two-shoes".  They are very loyal to the Nancy Drew presented in the original print series.  However, writers are very careful not to make her seem "bitchy" or "whiney", although she does get angry and defensive at times.  I asked Mom if they were doing anything to give players more agency within the game, and she responded they were making an option for players to change the interface...and that's pretty much it.  With these games, sometimes constraints are needed and enjoyed by players.  The objective is simple:  solve the mystery.  There's no need to change Nancy's hair color or make her pet a dog while she's at it.</p>
<p>Now I bet most of you wish you had parents as cool as mine.  Go Mom.</p>
