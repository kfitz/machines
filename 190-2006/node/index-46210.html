    <div class="content"><p>One thing that I thought was interesting in the readings was Zimmerman's reference to video games suffering from a bad case of "cinema envy".</p>
<p>I think this is pretty evident <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AgVGPba6SA"> in this trailer</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, this video game is being released with the MOVIE Eragon, but still.  It subscribes to the same theatrical methods of a full-length feature film.  I think it really demonstrates how we, the consumers, have come to expect some sort of "story" with our games, and the industry has responded by attempting to link their products to the successful multi-billion dollar movie industry (even though, as we learn in the book, the game industry is larger).  I feel as though I've seen dozens of flashy, bright, melodramatic trailers for video games.  They are hard to take seriously, because come on!  It's a video game.  It's not like the user is ever going to make their character do anything but destroy bad guys.  And yet the marketing strategy is successful.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I wonder if the way people build blog identities doesn't shed light on the way we build our real-life identities that we project to others. I know some blogs seeminly bear no relation to their authors -- people create fake blogs all the time - but I think that the authors of even these blogs come through in some way in the online "person" they have created so I will not distinguish between fake blogs and blogs that are just a version of the real person they are created by. That said, when a blog-identity is developed, the author can almost fully hide certain aspects of themselves. They can manipulate how others see them to a much greater degree than we can in our real lives. In this manner, it seems the idea that we cultivate others' perceptions of our identities (and we do it in line with how we <em>want</em> others to see us) is similar in both real life and on the internet. The difference is that it is more extreme on the internet.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I went to the fuzzysquid.com/LJ.com site someone posted about earlier and, I'm very sorry, but not one of the images compelled me to actually look at the person's blog. Fuzzysquid.com/LJ is a compilation of the 40 most recently posted images on livejournal. Most of the pictures looked like things people would post on their myspace site. Maybe I just stumbled upon the site at an extraordinarily boring time, but my guess is that these forty images were representative of livejournal as a whole. If forty images are being posted, and there are thousands of interesting blogs and only a few bad ones, chances are that not all forty images would happen to come from the bad ones.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>On page 197 of First Person, Henry Jenkins' online response says, "Contemporary film style is more elliptical and rapid-fire than the classical continuity system precisely because a generation that spends many hours per day consuming media demands cognitive challenges and perceptual puzzles rather than straightforward exposition."</p>
<p>I saw the Prestige last weekend, which may be a textbook example of this. in this film, the beginning is pretty much the same scene as the end. In between,  the film shifts back and forth between periods of time, and references made in the beginning are not made clear until the end, just as things that are told in the beginning change meanings throughout the film. This film could have been told as a straightforward linear narrative, but it wouldn't have been as interesting, for just the reason that Jenkins says. We are constantly consuming media everyday, and if the story is not going to be extremely original (which very few are) then the way in which it is told needs to be.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The worst part about first person</p>
<p>is the pages. They're too thin. I'm pretty sure these pages wouldn't actually pass as paper in a court of law. They're more like the cheap toilet paper they had at my high school. The pages' absurd thinness makes the book too flimsy, and awkward to hold. But the worst part about the thinness of pages is that if you are, for example, on page 135, you'd be feeling pretty good about yourself with most books. First Person is a different story. If you're on 135, you are only a quarter inch through this thing.</p>
<p>This book is inaffective because it discourages slow readers like myself.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Simon Penny's article "Representation, Enaction, and the Ethics of Simulation" had some points that really caught my attention. First of all, on page 77, the word phallocentric appears, which instantly validates the article. Phallocentricity, by the way, is climbing the ladder of my favorite words. It's in my top 8 for sure. </p>
<p>On page 77, Penny quotes David Grossman who says that kids are essentially practicing to kill with these videogames. Much like a flight simulator does for pilots, videogames teach children how to kill every target in their visual field. The most fascinating part of this was note #8 at the end of the article on page 83. Essentially, the point was that the kid who opened fire in a school in Paducah, Kentucky was an unusually good shot. He fired 8 shots, hitting 8 different children, 5 of which he hit in the head, and 3 of which he hit in the upper torso. They were trying to imply that because this kid played shooting videogames for hours each day that he was that much better of a shot. I disagree with this. While I do think it's a n interesting coincidence, a child's mastery of up, down, up, left, right, start is not going to help him pick up a 3 pound piece of steel and aim it with his eyes and steady his hands and squeeze a trigger 8 different times. One skill has nothing to do with the other.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, after that (quite overly-long) entry on Post Secret, I've realized my mind is very much still churning. I've now got on to thinking about authorship and Post Secret. In looking at authorship in relationship to Post Secret we are not only confronted by the interplay between authorship and intention but also by the fact that what we see in the Post Secret website and in the books has been touched by someone other than the secret-holders. Frank Warren is allowed to edit the submissions and print and post some submissions while leaving out others. On the books, he is listed as the sole author. (Of course, what other author could he possibly list since the whole point is that the postcards are sent anonymously???). Still, it is these anonymous authors' words that I read in the books and on the website and I feel they are so much more the authors of Post Secret than Frank Warren. Really though, the only way I can justify to myself that he is credited as the author is by appointing him as the author of the idea.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Post Secret is a website??? Why did you tell me this? This could be very bad... A friend of mine has the Post Secret book, and I found myself completely sucked in. Now I'm sure I'll become addicted to the website too. (For those who didn't read the post earlier today on Authorship and the Internet, Post Secret is this thing where people send postcards to this guy named Frank Warren sharing their most personal secrets. Warren then selects which submissions to post in books and on the website. He is also allowed to edit the submissions if he wants to.) I get a weird feeling reading the postcards because if I met the authors, these would be things I would not be privy to, but somehow in the anonymous world of the internet it is ok that I know. Reading Post Secret is like finding a terribly juicy diary, itching to read it, and without reservation, giving in.</p>
