<p>So now TV is taking its plots from the internet? WHOA. This will hopefully get more people to watch the real LonelyGirl15. I guess im becoming a bigger of YouTube creators. why not? I'm definetly not one to criticize someone for trying to do something they find worthy of being done.</p>

<p>For more info, go to the Wired Magazine article here: http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.12/lonelygirl_pr.html</p>
<p>or wikipedia Lonelygirl15. </p>
<p>Essentially, its a video series on youtube about a young girl and her video blog shot in her room. except. its totally fictional. initially, the series was assumed to be real  because there was no disclaimer stating otherwise. When it was first posted, the video mocked an already popular non fictional (or as non fictional as an internet identity can get) youtube vlog (video blog). This essentially was what helped create a fanbase for it. After a few months, the creators were outed. And just how many "great" things are made popular or known by controversy, so was Lonelygirl15. It was the shock that propelled it into notoreity. And rather than being the end of the series, this was the beginning of something new.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Today at my internship I was asked to screen several movies, all of which should never have been made in the first place with exception to Lloyd Kaufman's "POULTRYGEIST: NIGHT OF THE CHICKEN DEAD" (which I didn't even get to see because it was just a promo package from G4's ATTACK OF THE SHOW...which I interned for last summer...and the other film company I intern for subbed a script to us today...so all my internships have come full circle...and I think I have too many internships and should just get a real job KTHX).  </p>
<p>When I stuck the imaginatively named "Haunted Boat" into the DVD player, it didn't work.  In fact, the DVD player made like it was going to explode.  AND I KNEW IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE STUPID ELECTRONIC HANDSHAKE.  Apparently the DVD was burned in a manner that made the DVD player mad because it wasn't watermarked etc. appropriately.  The disk wasn't burned incorrectly, because it will play on other players.  Normally i wouldn't really care, but after reading ANARCHIST I was pretty pissed off when the DVD player spat the DVD out for the 3rd time.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Thanks to those of you who came to the Michael Barnes talk today!  What did you think?  To be honest, he sort of bored me at the beginning with his discussion of sociological theorists...it just didn't seem all that dynamic or engaging...BUT I thought he was excellent when he talked about hip hop DJ culture.  It was especially cool that he incorporated music and video clips into his talk (particularly the video clip he recorded at the DMC, which shows that he went to the competition and is really involved in hip hop culture on a personal level).  I think he'd be great as a prof in an elective class on hip hop or any other subject he's really passionate about, but I think his intro theory courses might make some students fall asleep.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Siva Vaidhyanathan's Anarchist in the Library spells out a lot of problems that the United States and United States copyright law specifically, are facing today. One story that I thought was really interesting was that of Alice Randall. She was the woman who wrote The Wind Done Gone. She and Houghton Mifflin were sued by the estate of whoever wrote Gone With the Wind because it used their "property." The Supreme Court ruled that Randall's book was a parody of the original work Gone with the Wind. Parodies are apparently allowed under current copyright law. </p>
<p>Siva sums it up perfectly at the end of this story though when he begs the question, what if Randall did not have the help of a major publisher? Would she have won this decision if she were less important to a huge company financially? I may be skeptical of the US court system, but I tend to think she would not have. I think if it was the estate of a famous American writer, versus some woman who "stole" most of her story, the courts would side with the estate.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival, Trisha (who is maybe the temple's PR person, we were unsure) ushered us into a room, presented us with maybe the best tea we've ever had, and sat us down to watch a Discovery Channel documentary about the Tzu Chi, or Buddhist Compassion Relief, Foundation.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>OK seriously, I can't believe I keep blogging about magazines--this is the last one, I swear.</p>
<p>Sooo maybe I never made it all the way through Time magazine--you know, things to do, places to go, people to see, whatever, so I moved on to Budget Travel.  </p>
<p>No sooner than I open up the magazine do I find something to blog about!  </p>
<p>In the first few pages of Budget Travel from November is a two-page ad for various vacations in Italy from "the Globus family of vacations" (four different travel package programs catering to independent, luxury, budget and-- I don't know, one more kind of traveler).  For some reason, all of their photographs of "real Italy" are totally ridiculous.  I mean, it shouldn't be possible to completely caricaturize, in so many different ways, a whole place in so few pictures.  These photographs feature all of the essentials: the backs of two pensive American travelers, stopped at an otherwise empty sidewalk cafÃ© in front of two empty cups of espresso ("A Monograms independent vacation gives you all the time you need ot sip espresso and soak up local culture"); a vineyard snaking over rolling Tuscan hills ("Globus travelers enjoy a private wine tasting and lunch at the splendid Verrazzano Castle"--as do Syracuse University study abroad students, incidentally); and photographs of a Venetian bridge, a few gondolas, and the Roman Coleseum.  What strikes me as strange about all of these pictures is the total lack (except for the espresso shot) of people; neither tourists nor Italians show up in any of these photographs.  Perhaps the purpose of this is to create a sense of intimacy with the sites that Globus is insinuating it is capable of delivering, but it's almost disconcerting, implying that the impetus of travel lies in the confrontation between the self and the site, not the confrontation of the self and, well, the whole package.</p>

But, since I started working as a co-fac and picking up the mail, I've been flipping through the issues, and they're amazing.  It's obviously a feminist magazine, but it isn't overly political (just the right balance of fluff pieces about how much Paris Hilton deserves to be punched in the face with pieces that critically examine our government/society), and always has interesting interviews and reviews and art pieces and--</p>
