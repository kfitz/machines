    <div class="content"><p>Does anyone remember Poe, that woman who was kind of a hit for 5 minutes in the mid-90's?  She sang that "Angry Johnny" song?</p>
<p>Did anyone else notice the little Poe blurb on the back of House of Leaves?  It says: "listen to the house. . . "HAUNTED" The new cd from Poe on Atlantic Records".  I'd seen this a number of times before I really started thinking about how strange it is for a book like House of Leaves to have a cross-media product blurb on its back cover.  </p>
<p>So then I realized that the text on the top of page 89 ("'pinch it', she said, which I did, lightly, until she also said 'pull it' which I also did, gently..."), which I'd thought had been recited in a Jewel song (that would've been even weirder) was actually recited in the beginning of a Poe song (Hey Pretty).  Okay, so there's that.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While weaving my way through the textual labyrinth that is House of Leaves, I stumbled upon a very applicable media studies discussion.  After some discussion of the technical differences between Hollywood film and documentary film, Danielewski or should I say Zampano, or maybe Truant, I'm not quite sure, anyhow... the narrator mentions how in the past "live footage was limited to the aftermath-the oral histories given by survivors or photographs taken by pedestrians- these days the proliferation of affordable video cameras and tapes has created more of an opportunity for someone to record a plane wreck or bank robbery as it is actually taking place."  Moreover, the recent advances in video and photo technology on cell phones are making this phenomenon even more apparent.</p>

I'm hoping I'm not the only dork in this class that would waste 20 minutes decoding the letter but in case I am, the letter is as follows.   </p>
<p>Dearest Johnny,</p>
<p>They have found a way to break me. Rape a fifty six year old bag of bones. There is no worse and don't believe otherwise.</p>
<p>The attendants do it. Others do it to. Not everyday, not every week, maybe not even every month, but they do it.  Some one I don't know always comes.  When it's dark. Late. I've learned not to scream, screaming gave me hope and unanswered hope is shattered hope.  Think of your Haitain.  It is far saner to chose rape than shattered hope. So I submit and I drift.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was talking to my friend today and she told me about a reality TV show she had heard of in England that was set up like the Bachelorette.  The twist was the girl these guys were dating used to be a man (unknown to the contestants).  I googled it and couldn't find this show, so I am not sure if this premise is entirely true.</p>
<p>This however made me think about the ethics of reality television.  If psychologists have to submit experimental designs to ethics committees to ensure minimal physical or psychological damage there is no reason reality TV shouldn't face these same restrictions.  Psychology is in the name of science but an experiment in which heavy amounts of psychological stress was induced by deception, would never fly.  In reality television I feel they push the boundaries, trying to find more ways to push there contestants in the name of entertainment.  In other countries for example Big Brother is a huge success, I have heard stories of people giving birth in the house, people going nearly crazy in the house, people being manipulated by the producers and forced (slightly) to do things they clearly don't want to do, est..  Yes, these people agree before hand to do whatever the producers throw at them, but there is a lot of pressure involved.</p>

Also, will it also discuss my other grandmother, whom I will be interviewing this winter and for whom I will be creating another website. I hope to link the two sites together so that I can make a comparison of the merged site to the book Parallel Lives by Plutarch, a Greek guy. Parallel Lives was one of the first biographies. This would lend itself to research that did focus more on literary form and its historical development. I could study other exemplary biographies and translate what they do well to the electronic medium, just as many screenwriters have done when adapting books to film.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, so as mentioned at the end of last entry, I don't think I will be able to take advantage of the inspirational professor I met with for two hours two weeks ago. This is because he deals more with simple, practical classroom usages of media, whereas I need to do a theoretical paper. I now have appointments with two other professors, who will hopefully be my readers. Profesora Donapetry, a Spanish teacher specializing in women's studies, might be very helpful because I am will be continuing the work I started over the summer, the creation of an online biography of my grandmother (a Mexican woman.) Profesora Donapetry would be able to help me in the content of the website, perhaps not so much the format. However, the content and its cultural implications might help shape the structure. For example, the website's audience might be older (closer in age to my grandmother.) And many viewers may be from Mexico, where digital technology is less available. Both older and technologically inexperienced people would need a very simple interface, perhaps one that starts with an introductory video, which is very attention-grabbing. I could then comment on the importance of the image in an increasingly globalized, international world, and I could expound on the differing experiences of the internet for people of various ages. Yes, the content does inform the structure.</p>

Here's a quick synopsis: Flava Flav (you may remember him from Public Enemy, or his short stint on VH1's The Surreal Life) is looking for a mate on a television show which is basically a mockery of The Bachelor (Flav gives giant clock necklaces instead of roses to continuing contestants), but a whole lot crazier.  In the first episode, for example, not only was there a fist-fight between two contestants (which one girl later attempted to reconcile by offering, "You want some Lip Chap??"), but one girl seriously took a crap on Flav's floor.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Speaking of off the topic, let me waste 30 seconds of your time.</p>
<p>In my sculpture class last week, we were looking at some slides of some famous "art" pieces. We were looking at the work of some guy who's name i can't remember who chiseled these incredibly detailed marble sculptures. We were comparing this to the work of some other guy I can't remember whose sculptures were essentially just things he found that he modified slightly. For example, one of his pieces of "art" was a urinal that he painted some very small letters on, and set on its back.<br />
By taking an object that he did not create, and altering it ever so slightly, yet calling it his work, he is raising many questions of authorship. Is he still the "author" of this work, even though he didn't really create it? Does his style of "art" make him any less of an "artist" than the first guy who does something that people consider more legitimate.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I was reading this article today online about the LA Gay and Lesbian Center's new ad campaign to fight the spread of HIV. Basically, the ads say "HIV is a gay disease. Own it. End it." The goal is to target apathetic gay men, which I think is valid, but the way they're going about seems seriously flawed to me.   "HIV/AIDS is a gay disease" is a stereotype that the queer community has been fighting against since the disease was discovered. It has been used as a justification for homophobia. I don't think that using language that comes out of a tradition of homophobic rhetoric is the wrong way to go. It also glosses over the ever increasing numbers of black women with AIDS today. There has to be a better way to raise awareness about HIV, for gay men and for everyone.</p>
