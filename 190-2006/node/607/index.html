    <div class="content"><p>So I was reading this book called Making Sense of Media the other day, and stumbled upon an essay called "A Postmodern Perspective on Madonna" by a professor at Amherst. It starts off, "In the works of Madonna, a predominant concept is the concept of textual consciousness. It could be said that the primary theme of the works of Madonna is not, in fact, discourse, but subdiscourseâ€¦" I'm reading the article as I usually read things with the word "postmodern" in their title and I'm thinking, hmmmâ€¦ yeah, I guess I can see that, wait, let me read that one more time, hmmm, maybe once more, yes, I agree with that, what is she saying here? Ok, let's figure it out. Ohhh, right right right. I get to the end of the article though, and I see I have been completely duped!!! It wasn't even a real essay. It was written by something called a "Postmodern Generator" which apparently "creates essays that seem, at first glance, reasonable, but turn out to be unintelligible". So I guess it turns out that what I thought were just incredibly convoluted sentence structure and ideas (a bad habit that all postmodern authors just so happened to have a habit of) is actually a systematic form of backward, unintelligible writing that they are TRYING to achieve! The essay I read is just making fun of the fact that a few philosophers, media theorists, cultural critics, etc. have created such a ridiculous form of writing that a generator can produce a "postmodernist" essay just as easily. Go to http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo and the first thing that pops up will be an essay created by a postmodern generator. Here's the one I got:</p>
<p>Modernism, capitalist Marxism and nationalism<br />
O. David Humphrey<br />
Department of Semiotics, Harvard University<br />
1. Narratives of defining characteristic<br />
"Society is unattainable," says Debord; however, according to d'Erlette[1] , it is not so much society that is unattainable, but rather the dialectic, and eventually the genre, of society. Therefore, the characteristic theme of Scuglia's[2] essay on neodialectic sublimation is a self-fulfilling whole.<br />
The primary theme of the works of Smith is not discourse per se, but neodiscourse. Sartre's analysis of cultural situationism states that narrativity is capable of significant form. Thus, Lyotard promotes the use of neodialectic sublimation to deconstruct and modify class.<br />
The characteristic theme of Bailey's[3] model of modernism is a subtextual paradox. Therefore, Sartre suggests the use of modernist discourse to attack the status quo.<br />
The premise of neodialectic sublimation holds that language may be used to reinforce hierarchy. However, Foucault uses the term 'modernism' to denote not narrative, but neonarrative.<br />
A number of theories concerning neodialectic sublimation exist. But if predialectic situationism holds, we have to choose between neodialectic sublimation and Batailleist `powerful communication'.<br />
2. Predialectic situationism and the cultural paradigm of discourse<br />
"Society is intrinsically dead," says Lacan; however, according to de Selby[4] , it is not so much society that is intrinsically dead, but rather the futility, and subsequent defining characteristic, of society. The subject is interpolated into a neodialectic sublimation that includes culture as a totality. Thus, Marx promotes the use of Debordist situation to analyse art.<br />
Modernism states that the raison d'etre of the observer is deconstruction, given that truth is equal to sexuality. It could be said that Sargeant[5] suggests that we have to choose between neodialectic sublimation and cultural appropriation.<br />
Many discourses concerning a mythopoetical paradox may be found. But the subject is contextualised into a submaterial sublimation that includes consciousness as a whole.<br />
Baudrillard suggests the use of neodialectic sublimation to challenge the status quo. In a sense, the closing/opening distinction prevalent in Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 emerges again in Vineland, although in a more self-justifying sense.<br />
3. Pynchon and the cultural paradigm of discourse<br />
In the works of Pynchon, a predominant concept is the concept of textual sexuality. Debord uses the term 'modernism' to denote not discourse, but prediscourse. It could be said that Foucault promotes the use of the cultural paradigm of discourse to modify and read class.<br />
"Culture is part of the futility of narrativity," says Marx. The subject is interpolated into a subdialectic paradigm of expression that includes art as a paradox. Therefore, if modernism holds, we have to choose between the cultural paradigm of discourse and cultural libertarianism.<br />
In the works of Pynchon, a predominant concept is the distinction between feminine and masculine. In Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon deconstructs neodialectic sublimation; in Vineland he examines precapitalist theory. However, several dematerialisms concerning modernism exist.<br />
"Society is used in the service of class divisions," says Baudrillard. Dietrich[6] states that we have to choose between neocultural theory and dialectic postcultural theory. But the premise of neodialectic sublimation suggests that truth serves to disempower the Other.<br />
If one examines modernism, one is faced with a choice: either reject dialectic rationalism or conclude that expression is created by communication. Lyotard uses the term 'modernism' to denote a mythopoetical whole. It could be said that if precultural narrative holds, the works of Pynchon are an example of material nationalism.<br />
"Art is fundamentally meaningless," says Lacan. An abundance of theories concerning the difference between society and sexual identity may be revealed. Therefore, in Mason &amp; Dixon, Pynchon denies modernism; in Gravity's Rainbow, although, he reiterates neodialectic sublimation.<br />
Any number of desublimations concerning the cultural paradigm of discourse exist. It could be said that Marx suggests the use of subdialectic libertarianism to deconstruct the status quo.<br />
The genre, and thus the futility, of the cultural paradigm of discourse depicted in Pynchon's Vineland is also evident in Mason &amp; Dixon. But Sontag promotes the use of modernism to modify society.<br />
Marx uses the term 'the cultural paradigm of discourse' to denote the stasis, and subsequent rubicon, of cultural language. Therefore, Wilson[7] implies that the works of Pynchon are reminiscent of Burroughs.<br />
Sartre uses the term 'Batailleist `powerful communication'' to denote the common ground between sexual identity and class. But if neodialectic sublimation holds, we have to choose between cultural neocapitalist theory and conceptual narrative.<br />
The primary theme of the works of Pynchon is not, in fact, theory, but pretheory. In a sense, Lyotard suggests the use of neodialectic sublimation to attack capitalism.<br />
The characteristic theme of Dahmus's[8] essay on modernism is a mythopoetical totality. But the subject is contextualised into a cultural paradigm of discourse that includes art as a paradox.<br />
Sontag uses the term 'neodialectic sublimation' to denote the paradigm of conceptual society. It could be said that in Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon denies neotextual theory; in Mason &amp; Dixon he analyses modernism.<br />
4. Consensuses of dialectic<br />
If one examines cultural objectivism, one is faced with a choice: either accept modernism or conclude that government is responsible for the status quo. Debord promotes the use of poststructural deconstruction to read and analyse narrativity. However, Marx uses the term 'the cultural paradigm of discourse' to denote the role of the artist as poet.<br />
In the works of Pynchon, a predominant concept is the concept of semanticist sexuality. The subject is interpolated into a modernism that includes consciousness as a reality. Therefore, the example of neodialectic sublimation prevalent in Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 emerges again in V, although in a more self-supporting sense.<br />
Tilton[9] suggests that we have to choose between the cultural paradigm of discourse and pretextual narrative. However, the subject is contextualised into a modernism that includes language as a paradox.<br />
The main theme of the works of Pynchon is a mythopoetical totality. Thus, Baudrillard suggests the use of neodialectic sublimation to deconstruct outdated perceptions of society.<br />
The subject is interpolated into a cultural paradigm of discourse that includes truth as a reality. Therefore, modernism states that consensus must come from the masses, but only if the premise of neodialectic sublimation is valid; if that is not the case, language is capable of significance.<br />
The subject is contextualised into a cultural paradigm of discourse that includes narrativity as a whole. Thus, Lacan promotes the use of modernism to read art. </p>
