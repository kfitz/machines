    <div class="content"><p>Feel free to skip this one guys, it's boring, mostly about thesis and feeling overwhelmed and sorry for myself and has a lot to do with the fact that I haven't had much time for blogging lately and now I'm bored and would rather do this than the other work I should be doing...which says a lot.</p>
<p>I just finished doing my annotated bibliography or atleast as much of it as is getting done at the moment. It was not really helpful to me because I use a color-coded sticky note system to physically annotate all my books so that I can find what I need, meaning that compiling it into a Word document seemed pretty pointless. I wish I had more of my research done but the problem is that with all the other reading I have to do, for this class and my other classes, on top of the other work which I have to do for my other classes (Cristi I know you hear me on how time consuming Flash is), combine with the paid work I do so that I can eat (I gave up on the dining halls long ago), and my desperate attempts to maintain some semblence of a relationship with my incredibly understanding girlfriend, I just don't have time for reading *extra* books on thesis and this is starting to worry me. And it's not like I've been goofing off. Quite the opposite in fact. I haven't had a day in which I don't spend at least 5 hours working on school work out of class, plus I work 15 hours a week at my jobs. I'm just completely overwhelmed. I desperately need a break and Thanksgiving is not going to be long enough and the prospect of staying here and using Thanksgiving to get work done because I have no other choice is depressing. This blog mocks. I haven't updated my personal LJ in months. I don't think of three things a week that are worth posting here with is why you are all being subjected to my melancholy ramblings, because what else do I have to say? My brain is fried. I don't have time to check out interesting media to write about because when the hell am I going to do that? I haven't watched  a movie since early September because I haven't had 2 consecutive hours of free time since them, unless you count sleep. I am not exagerating. I am completely serious. I don't have time to hang out with friends. I don't have time to call my family. I don't have time to watch media. My laundry pile is consuming half my room because I don't have time for that. I don't have time for anything and you would think that with all this time I'm devoting to school work I would be on top of things but I'm not. I'm still overwhelmed. I know eveything will get done because it has to get done but I'm becoming increasingly concerned that I will not be as productive over winter break as I want to be becasue the majority of it will have to be spent recuperating from my impending breakdown. After a class presentation and two midterms last week you would think things would be letting up, but no dice. My only hope is stave off mental collapse until Christmas break and accept that I will not be performing at my usual level in any of my classes because they are all asking too much of me. And finally a big FUCK YOU goes out to my Physics class for not only sucking but being required so I can't even drop it.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>hey i feel you.  posting at 12:30 on a friday night proves it.  i've been freaking out pretty constantly as of late, &amp; wanting to write a blog like that (maybe a little more cussing) for a long time.  this is ridiculously trite, but honestly, take a break because you'll end up caring more about the friends and fun you had in college than how many A+s you earned (listen your blog so far is awe-inspiring and completely stressful to have to compete with, so you have nothing to worry about).  &amp; if your drop deadline hasn't already passed, drop that shitty physics course and take Physics in Society next semester, it's supposed to be easy for non-majors &amp; generally an awesome course</p>

  <div class="content"><p>i mos def. can relate to your posting. this semester has been insanely busy for me. for me, it's just i'm trying to make the most of my last year in college, and by doing that I'm stretching myself really thin, and sort of sucking at everything i do...but enough about me...</p>
<p>what struck me about your post was worrying that your break won't be as productive as you want to me cuz you have to recuperate from the semester. i think resting and recuperating is a productive way to spend your time. we're so used to thinking that being productive is getting these particular things done, but in reality taking care of yourself is just as important and just as productive.</p>
