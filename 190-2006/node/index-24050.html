      <span class="submitted">Submitted by neurotica on 24 October 2006 - 1:03am.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li  class="first taxonomy_term_318"><a href="../taxonomy/term/318/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_318">asian tv</a></li>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Another topic I was thinking about doing was exploring networks that target specific identities. for example, in the last few years there has been the creation of a couple Asian-American TV networks, such as AZN TV and Imaginasian TV, and queer channels, such as LOGO, Here TV, and the now defunct QTV. There have been such channels for awhile, such as BET, Lifetime, Oxygen and Spike TV. However, what interested me about the Asian and the Queer ones (Besides the fact that those are both part of my identities and the channels suck less than Oxygen and Lifetime), is that they are new, so they are in the process of creating what asian-american identity is or what queer identity is in television. this is particularly true with asian-americans, since there is virtually no asian-american programming outside these networks. What statements do these channels say with their programming? Do they cater to a wide audience within their respective targets or do they offer a limited view? At home, I have access to AZN TV. It's programming is interesting. It has some specifically Asian-American programming, like one that looks at upcoming films, another that looks at asian-american comedians, and another that will document a few students while their applying to ivy league colleges. mixed in with asian-american programming, is straight up asian programming from asia, like those korean dramas i've been talking about. in this construction of asian-america, while the channel acknowledges that there is a unique asian-american identity, they create a link with both america and asia by featuring asian programming. asian-american encompasses many different people, it can apply to those who have just immigrated (if they choose to identify as such) or those born here after generations of parents living here. does AZN TV unite these people? in my own experience, my mom would watch the channel alot for her korean soap operas, which is pretty devoid from dealing with the issues of racism that asian-americans have to deal with. however, during the channel promos that would be shown during commercials, various hosts from other shows would talk about their experiences with being asian-american...so my lil asian mommy who doesn't directly discuss the issues of race and asian-americana becomes exposed to those issues, and i the american can become exposed to asian cultural exports. however, AZN TV is still pretty heterocentric (though there was one segment in the film show once that talked about the queer film "Saving Face" but other than that it's heterocity). also, almost all the asian-american hosts of shows are east asian, only one is south asian, only one is mixed. AZN TV only represents a very specific segment of Asian-America.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>3) Wikipedia. There's a lot to say in how it is deconstructing expert culture, since theoretically everyone has equal access in writing and editing no matter what one's resume is. does this resemble the messages of some progressive models of critical pedagogy, such as paulo freire's work about how education is divided up in teacher-students and students-teachers, with a less hierarchal flow of information? Or is this problematic since so many people use it? Is it spreading false information? Or is its rate of accuracy not too different from other sorts of media, but people fear it? Why do people go on wikipedia so much? simply because it's more accessible? is accessibility more important than accuracy? Because anyone can write what they want, you see the emergence of subjects that usually aren't taken seriously, from subcultures to pop culture, to the newest technologies, being presented as legitimate topics worth knowing about.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>2) In East Asian countries, like China, and Vietnam, Korean popular culture is ridiculously--.er--.popular. Television dramas, such as Winter Sonata, to singers such as Rain have become phenomenons across Asia. In fact, in 2006, Time Magazine named Rain (who is akin to Usher and JT) the second most influential entertainer in the world. Korean actors are some of the most highest paid outside of Hollywood. This first piqued my interest because a lot of people in my family, including my mom and cousins are really into Korean dramas. Also, when I went to Vietnam, Korean culture was the cool trend, from films to food.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Somehow, though I have a tenuous relationship with academia (not comfortable in ivory towers), while unsuccessfully trying to find one thesis topic, everything suddenly became really interesting to me. Here's a list of random topics that are interesting that I have yet to blog about, though I have no idea whether I will do any of these or not. Everything interests me but not paricularly more than anything, so I think i might settle on wikipedia (since that was what my proposal was on). What do you think my thesis should be on? Just comment on them!<br />
:</p>
<p>1) Music copyright law and its impact on tv/film: With current copyright, its really expensive to get the rights to show someone else's stuff in your work, even if it's incidentally there. This is really impacting documentaries. For example, there was this case where in a documentary they were just shooting random people, and someone's phone when off and the ring tone was the Rocky theme, and the company expected the filmmakers to pay for the rights. How is this impacting filmmaking and television production? In the film, I am Sam, the featuring of Beatles song was an important part of the narrative. However, since the filmmaker couldn't afford the rights, instead she features Beatles covers, by Rufus Wainwright, Sarah Mclachlan, etc. Another interesting example are these two documentaries about Morrissey and how he has a large Latino fan base. One of them, Viva Morrissey, features a lot of music, and has been having trouble getting rights, and hasn't been widely distributed, just in festival circuits. Another film, Is It Really So Strange, works around the law by not having music at all, which is pretty interesting, the idea of a music documentary without music. Is the need to work around copyright law creating new innovations?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>On page 38 of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray states that, "to be alive in the twentieth century is to be aware of the alternative possible selves, of alternative possible worlds, and of the limitless intersecting stories of the actual world." </p>
<p>This quote reminded me of an improv show I went to on Sunday night. Three of the skits/games in particular stood out. The first one was a game in which there are two different two-person scenes going on, one being frozen while the other is in action. After awhile, the active scene stops and the frozen scene starts up again, using the last line from the formerly active scene (did that make sense?). Although that line remains the same in both scenes, both scenes were entirely different and used it in different ways. Game two was called "new choice" in which two people act out a scene, while the host periodically says "new choice", forcing them to go back and change the line they just said. This in effect changes the course of the scene, leaving the audience to follow the new direction while still wondering how the scene would have played out if the original line had been kept. The third game was one in which two people are acting out a scene until they are forced to freeze. While they're frozen, another person must step in and replace one of the actors in the scene, putting their body into the same position as the person they replaced. It was interesting to see how much the addition of this new person could change the scene. Although the actors were positioned in the same way, the meaning of that positioning totally shifted. Though <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> discusses this kind of narrative in new media forms, it was interesting to me to see them played out in a theater format.</p>

<p>Sophia Lamar has beef with fellow gender benders Amanda Lepore and Jefree Star</p>
<p>Sophia Lamar (born Enrique MuÃ±oz in 1955 in Castro's Cuba) has long been a fixture of New York Night Life, starting off with Michael Alig and the original Club Kids, and now a fixture at Misshapes. She also has a weekly outlet to air her thoughts in Johnny McGovern's Gay Pimpin' podcast, where her popular segment "What Sophia Lamar Hates" ends each episode.</p>
<p>Sophia charged MySpace "e-celebrity" Jeffree Star with ripping her off. Sophia Lamar is the muse of fashion design collective Ok Citizen's Society which years ago created a shirt with the phrase "Sophia Lamar Will Kill You", and since then Sophia has adopted the phrase for her official website http://www.sophialamarwillkillyou.com. Well it seems Jeffree Star has started selling his own version of the shirt (seen here) with the phrase "Jeffree Star Will Kill You". Sophia noted how her shirt is sold in boutiques all across the world, and his is sold on myspace. She says his use of the phrase is like her saying "That's hot" or "You're Fired".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Just a quick note: in terms of intertextuality in new media, I think Lost presents one of the best and most thoroughly intriguing examples of a successful melding of medias.  Even within a single medium (television), Lost takes advantage of many of the developments Murray suggests are coming in future television-based media.  The show presents not only the storyline as it is taking place currently on the island, but also the back stories of different characters, switching between a few characters each episode, and changing character focuses every two to three.  I think this gives a far more complex (and ultimately more familar) notion of reality, and helps keep the show entertaining (so it isn't just a half hour of watching 25 people go "what the crap is going on??" every week).</p>

<p>My Mom got re-married this summer and, like all brides-to-be, it was pretty much all she could talk about.  Apparently, myself, my [now] stepdad and other friends and family weren't enough people to talk to, as she became really involved in a number of online wedding forums and posting boards as well.  For my stepdad and I, marriage gossip from these boards was actually in some ways welcome respite from my Mom's previous and equally vocal obsession with internet-based geneaology-- that's what we thought, anyway, until we realized that hearing about the wedding gown of "chrisandtara06" was not a whole lot more interesting than finding out "omgi'mrelatedtocharlemagne" was my great-great-great-step-twice-removed-uncle.  Nevertheless, my Mom was obsessed; I can even remember at least 3 times this summer that she mentioned, in passing, that she was up past 3 in the morning talking to other brides-to-be from around the country.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Aldous Huxley's idea Murray uses as throughout the book (basically "will the stories brought to us by the new representational technologies 'mean anything' in hte same way that Shakespeare's plays mean something, or will they be 'told by an idiot'?") is insanely interesting, and one which I've been thinking about since reading Brave New World in a high school class.  </p>
<p>What I've been thinking about more lately, though, is the inherent assumptions within such a question: why exactly do Shakespeare's plays mean what they mean?  I think it's a strong tendency of American culture to privilege the past in such discourses, to assume the supremacy of what's come before in the face of what's new.  I know, I know, Shakespeare is Shakespeare and obviously his work is exemplary, but it isn't because he was working in literature.  It wasn't the medium that made Shakespeare as amazing and influential as he was, it was him, his work, and his ability to manipulate his medium.</p>
