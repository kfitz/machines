    <div class="content"><p>Was going to include this in my last post, but I think it deserves a post on its own...</p>
<p>In thinking about new forms of classic media (such as House of Leaves (I would argue) and the Spore game I just blogged about, Brian Eno as quoted), I've been beginning to see the changes in authorship patterns.  Namely, I've noticed a trend in an author's willingness or openness to allow their work to be consumed and interpreted in ways that they can't predict.  In House of Leaves, it's up to the reader to choose which footnotes to read, what appendices to pay attention to, how much to invest, providing infinite opportunities to delve into the text.  In Spore, Will Wright has set up an environment that, instead of placing or installing a narrative or linear, predictable progression, gives literally all of the control to the consumer.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>There's a new computer game coming out called "Spore", created by Will Wright (the guy that created Sim City, The Sims, etc).  Essentially, in the game, you begin with a spore that you control, whose necessities you take care of just like in The Sims...  and evolve and as you evolve, you get to choose what changes are made to your creature: will you put a spike on their forehead so predators don't bite their heads off?  how about adding more tails to help them keep their balance?  And so the game goes, and you continue to evolve, until you become a creature that begins to build a tribe, then a civilization, then a globalized world...  and then you start trying to take over the rest of the universe.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I'm currently trying to write my thesis proposal, but despite the fact that I have an outline and quotes, my brain is saying no. I was thinking, maybe if I blog about it, I can get the juices flowing again. </p>
<p>So basically, my thesis is about Black rockers, postmodern black identities, and virtual communities. Like we talked about when we discussed the bell hooks article, "Postmodern Blackness," postmodernism has often been overlooked by the black community, yet it holds some really powerful ideas that could help to create conceptions of black identity that are more fluid, open, relevant to contemporary black lives, and that take into account the reality of diversity in the black community. I've come across two terms that describe this: post-black and newblack. I haven't entirely figured what the difference between these two are, but newblackness is defined as a contemporary moment in blackness which "embodies a radical fluidity within the spheres of blackness that allow for powerful conceptualizations across black genders, sexualities, ethnicities... socioeconomic positions, and socially constructed performances of 'black' identity"(Neal 122).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Or, <em>House of Leaves</em>.  </p>
<p>At first, I kind of hated the book.  It was too big, and there were too many footnotes.  Let me just put it out there that I DESPISE footnotes.  I make a point not to read footnotes, out of protest, unless I absolutely have to.  That and the prospect of turning my book upside-down and every which way to read it seemed like too much energy for homework.  </p>
<p>And then I got past the introduction and discovered that a) I was able to read this book for (literally) hours at a time without realizing it, b) that I was reading and enjoying the footnotes, and c) that I was taking it way too seriously.  Remember the part where Johnny asks the reader to imagine that something is behind them?  I tried to find it just now but it's buried in a footnote and I don't have the time/energy to read back through (I should have marked it the first time around but I don't like writing in "pretty" [read: non-academic] books).  Anyways, it scared the hell out of me.  I went into my friend's room to read.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After some research, I pretty much have a general idea of where I want to go with the final project paper. I'm just not sure where to take it exactly.... This is what I have written down concretely so far:</p>
<p>"According to Wikipedia, a social network is understood to mean "a social structure made of nodes which are generally individuals or organizations. It indicates the ways in which they are connected through various social familiarities ranging from casual acquaintance to close familial bonds."  With the introduction of internet based social networks, formally known as a social networking services, or SNS, users are allowed to build social networks through a social software and connect to other users based on whatever interests they desire. An internet based social network allows its users to create an identity that  may either be acurate or completely inaccurate depending on what they want to portray. Additionally, the overall accessibility to a social networking service is high, therefore allowing almost anyone to join, which may or may not pose a problem in terms of privacy. What this paper will attempt to do is explore and gain a better understanding of the impact that social networking services are having on identity management issues."</p>

I have already submitted my Senior Project proposal, but since I haven't really done anything other than broadly outline it and contact a few people that would be in it, nothing is concrete as of yet. I was wondering what you thought about the three possiblities that keep me awake at night.</p>
<p>1- Capturing DJ culture in LA. Here, I would interview DJs that occupy different realms of the art/business. I would talk to radio djs, turntablist djs, and club djs and see what similarities and differences exist between them. </p>
<p>2- An indepth portrait of Egon. He is the manager of the biggest independent hiphop label in the world - Stones Throw. Not only is he an amazing DJ, but he takes great photographs, and writes for a hiphop magazine. I assume he'll be busy, but it would be cool to get a glimpse of his life.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Another possible thesis topic: Differences in artistic protest during the Vietnam War and the Iraq War in the US.  I hypothesize that during the Vietnam War, mainstream artistic protest dominated music, film, and theatre, while during the Iraq War, primarily underground outlets have created protest art, filling the void left by reluctant mainstream corporations.  I would investigate the changes in media technology and deregulation that might have led to this change, such as the increasingly low cost of video cameras and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (which should be familiar by now).</p>
<p>	Vietnam War documentaries such as the 1974 Academy Award winner "Hearts and Minds" were both controversial and popular, and as a result antiwar art proved an intelligent marketing decision for media distributors.  As Evan Medow, CEO of Windswept Pacific music publishing company, says, "At the time [of Vietnam], it was a moneymaking proposition to be involved with countercultural artists--Antiwar music was more the order of the day."  Today, he continues, "The music business is under attack on every conceivable level, with downloading and new technologies like streaming video and broadband--Record companies want to get control of their product. They're not going to take risks just for the sake of making a political statement. With things the way they are, you're not going to get the adventuresome thinking necessary to put out political music" (Rudman).</p>

But hey, how bout I outline my various ideas for ya and maybe everything will come together.  By the by, my major is Social Activism through Media &amp; the Arts (MS/Politics/Theatre), so my thesis is gonna be leaning in that direction:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Everyone seems to be talking about House of Leaves right now, and a lot of you have really interesting things to say, but the book messes with my head too much for me to have anything intelligent to say about it, so for the moment I will discuss something else entirely...</p>
<p>I have Net Flix and lately I haven't had time for movies, I mean since when do I actually have over an hour of concurrent free time that isn't sleep? So instead I've been getting lots of TV shows from them. The problem is I've burned through most of the Simpsons and all of the Futurama that they have, plus a couple of crazy anime series (Serial Experiments Lain fucked with my head in a way similar to House of Leaves), so I'm beginning to look more at live action TV series. I tried <em>Sex and the City</em>, can't stand it. <em>Desperate Housewives</em> was even worse. I hate cop/law dramas, so that counts a lot out, and unlike most people I know I hate both <em>Seinfeld</em> and <em>Friends</em>. I've been told I should try <em>Monk</em> and <em>House MD</em>, I've seen a few episodes randomly and they seem promising. But that's beside the point. Anyway, last night was one of my biggest strikeouts yet. I took Net Flix and a couple of my friends up on their suggestion that I try </em>Weeds</em>, thinking, "oh this will be fun, light-hearted, maybe even a little counter cultural". I made it through the first episode, put it back in its mailer and sent it back, the worst run of any series yet. I mean no offense to anyone who likes <em>Weeds</em> or any of the other of the aforementioned TV shows. Many people that I like and respect like at least one, if not more of them, I'm just really picky about TV. But I mean really!</p>
