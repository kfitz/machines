    <div class="content"><p>After having batted around my original thesis idea for a while I've dedided to go in a new direction entirely and I'm still sort of molding this thing into a coherent idea (and one that is focused enough for a thesis to boot). Basically, as long as my final thesis still deals with the Dalai Lama and media, I think I will be happy so give me any ideas you may have. Here's what I've got so far:</p>
<p>I have recently become fascinated with how America has helped to create the world's image of the Dalai Lama as well as the image portrayed to Tibetans who are far from their homeland due to persecution by the Chinese. Many have fled to India and others to Europe and America. I wonder if perhaps even the Dalai Lama's own self image has changed due to the multitudes of documentaries, Hollywood films, and books that have him as the star. I feel that the media force of Hollywood must have influence over perceptions of the Dalai Lama but I am still learning about the films, books, magazines and other media sources that may have done this. </p>
<p>Confronted by the fact that this is too much for one thesis to hold, I will investigate the idea of how Hollywood portrays the Dalai Lama focusing on films where the Dalai Lama serves a central purpose. Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet fit best into this category but I am looking into additional films. Since there is a relative lack of research in this area, I plan to look at what others have written on "heroic" figures highlighted in the media such as Mother Teresa and the Pope, and apply these methodologies to my analysis</p>
<p>My examination of the media's treatment of the Dalai Lama will concentrate on whether the films are modifying their representation to make the Dalai Lama more accessible to Westerners. There are three main ways in which I expect the image of the Dalai Lama will be manipulated. First, I expect that the films that portray him will employ the usual reductionist, Hollywood framework. Secondly, I expect that the films will humanize the Dalai Lama to make him more accessible for Westerners. And lastly, it is likely that the portrayal of the Dalai Lama in American media will exotify the Dalai Lama as "Other". </p>
<p>The first way in which I expect that Hollywood will manipulate the image of the Dalai Lama to help Americans "understand" him and what he symbolizes is through breaking down what he represents into smaller, simpler pieces. My problem with using reductionism in portraying the Dalai Lama is that I think he is much more than the sum of smaller, simpler parts that represent him. For some people, what makes them special is far too rare and elusive to be captured on film. What they embody cannot be transported and delivered to the masses. This divine nature has even less of a chance of reaching the mass public, however, when it is subjected to the reductionist, Hollywood framework. It could be asked whether these Hollywood versions of Tibetan theology have had a spiritual impact on the society we live in, or is it strictly entertainment?  </p>
<p>The second probable way in which Hollywood film modifies the image of the Dalai Lama is through de-emphasizing the fact that he is one of the innumerable incarnations of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. The Dalai Lama has typically been portrayed in Western media as a person almost like us. For example, Robert Thurman co-authored a book on the Dalai Lama, titled, "A Simple Monk" a name that comes directly from His Holiness himself. The Dalai Lama says he is "just a simple monk". I would venture to bet that a large part of his popularity in the Western world stems from the fact that it is his humanness that is highlighted not his divinity. </p>
<p>Looking at other spiritual "heroes" such as Mother Teresa and Pope John Paul II it seems even more unusual that the Dalai Lama's connection with the divine would be down played. Let's take Mother Teresa for example. Three years ago, Mother Teresa was beatified by Pope John Paul II which is the second of several steps along the way to sainthood, but even before her death Mother Teresa was widely regarded as a "living saint". The Dalai Lama, in contrast insists he has no special wisdom to impart.</p>
<p>	The third method of modification of the image of the Dalai Lama that I expect to encounter is aptly described by Bell Hooks when she writes about the exotification of the "Other". Images of the Dalai Lama are susceptible to this type of commodification because he, his culture, and his religion are not what Americans are familiar with. Throughout my investigation I will be alert to the fact that American media often commodifies images of the 'exotic' for economic purposes. The "noble savage" attitude of westerners has been around ever since colonization and it is well documented by the historical accounts of the British Raj, and their condescending affinity for all things native.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tibet has historically been portrayed in the West as "Shangri-La" such as in James Hilton's Lost Horizon and in more recent times such as in the film, Seven Years in Tibet. Not only does depicting this far away heavenly place satisfy economic purposes in how it is exotified in Lost Horizon and Seven Years in Tibet it also satisfies economic purposes in how it allows the reader/viewer to enjoy escapist reading/viewing. The audience can be completely carried away from their own reality and therefore truly free from the daily grind and troubles. People have always paid well for such experiences, even when the economic climate was troubled, as shown by the continued spending of money for movie tickets during the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Of course, the "Shangri-La" image is not how Tibet truly is but it is not at all surprising that its image would be tailored in such a way so as to fulfill unsatisfied American desires â€“ exotifying the "Other" and escaping to a heaven on earth. Because the Dalai Lama is very likely the single most prominent figure associated with Tibet in the American mind, it seems impossible that people would not connect him with the image of Shangri-La. </p>
<p> 	In looking at films such as Seven Years in Tibet and Kundun I will want to examine them within their historical contexts as well as ask questions such as why they were produced and what effects these films create. For example, the Dalai Lama was very involved in the making of Kundun and there has been a 300% increase in International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) membership since its release according to ICT president, John Ackerly. Is this increase related to the film? It could easily be said that it is.</p>
<p>I also plan to analyze what effect the alliances between Hollywood stars and Tibet have had on the Dalai Lama and his cause. For example, the popularizing of Tibet has expanded tremendously with the help of actors such as Richard Gere who took advantage of his appearance on the Academy Awards telecast in 1992 to make comments about Chinese repression of Tibet. There are many others actors whose personas include Tibetan Buddhism â€“ Tina Turner, Keanu Reeves, George Seagal, Kate Bosworth and recently Jennifer Lopez. </p>
<p>I will have to begin my research process by expanding my knowledge of the fourteenth Dalai Lama, past Dalai Lamas, Buddhism, and Tibet. The last class I took that dealt with these topics was during my freshman year of high school so this task may be considerable. While becoming more familiar with these things, I will want to look for answers to questions such as is Tenzin Gyatso the first Dalai Lama to be recognized in Western media in any form (my guess is that he is) and in what way do the tenets of Buddhism conflict with Western media and Hollywood in particular?</p>
<p>Next, I will need to understand the history of the Dalai Lama and Tibet in the media. For the most part his early film exposure was only with documentaries such as The Religious Investiture of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (1958) and The Message of the Tibetans (1963), but there have been dozens of documentary films featuring him since then. I intend to see how the way he is portrayed in these documentaries compares to Hollywood films in the last decade. By doing this it may become clearer what influence large scale film has had on his image. I may pursue the question of whether Hollywood has in fact changed the image the Dalai Lama has of himself within the context of this comparative study of documentaries versus Hollywood films. I am interested to see how Hollywood has impacted the Dalai Lama's political life as well, though I believe this will only be a minor focus. I may briefly cover the way in which the Dalai Lama has been able to charge quietly forward politically throughout the global world, due to positive media and the reception of large scale Hollywood films.</p>
<p>	The increase in numbers going to his talks has been staggering. In 1996 he sold out the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney, Australia for seven straight days while Michael Jackson sold out just two shows at the Pavilion the following month. Additionally, tons of Dalai Lama books reside on shelves at Borders and Barnes and Noble, though they are less about the politics of China, Tibet and the U.S. and more directed to the "self help" sections. Through film and book mass marketing, the Dalai Lama has become fairly mainstream and yet there is relatively little in the news about his visits to various cities in the U.S or about the U.S.'s stance regarding Tibet now that we are so economically dependent on China. I do not intend to take this road in this thesis, however by looking at examples of all types of media I hope to see the changes that have taken place as Americans' image of the Dalai Lama has changed. </p>
<p>In essence, I could ask the question is Hollywood using the Dalai Lama or is the Dalai Lama using Hollywood?  I am not sure what the answer would be, but I would guess that it is a symbiotic relationship. In the end, is it better for Hollywood to avoid topics like this if Hollywood itself contradicts the Dalai Lama's ideals?  Or conversely, is it better to succumb to the fact that Hollywood may manipulate these images but be glad that it may be an effective way to spread messages of compassion and the Tibetan cause?</p>
