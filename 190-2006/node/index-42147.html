    <div class="content"><p>man guys.  class tonight made me so depressed.  it wasn't the material or the presentation.  well maybe the material, but just because all my classes are pretty heavily theory-based these days and i can't figure out what theory is other than boring philosophy.  do people really make a living off these essays debating whether games have narrative elements, and do essays like the n0time business get in unedited because people seriously care about this stuff or because the editors decided to play a joke on pretentious academics?  call me crazy but i got to thinking in class that the devil had designed theory to keep our minds occupied so we miss all the real stuff around us.  kind of like the radio.  there is so much going on.  crazy turkmenbashi is trying to build an ice palace in the desert. a million japanese guys are playing video games for decades &amp; refusing to leave their rooms.  isn't tibet the only place in the world where polygamy is one female with multiple husbands?  dark matter is mindblowing &amp; the multiverse seriously problemitizes our definition of auteur. (why do we say auteur?  in grad school do you just say everything in french to sound smarter?)  &amp; why when i'm frustrated do i say "man guys"?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>i found this reading particularly impossible to wrap my head around, as i kept coming back to the basic thought that video games and narratives are not so easily combined, and for good reason.  i can understand a desire to look at narratives in a critical context, and for game studies/ludology to develop as a theoretical approach to a growing medium... but after a while, i realized that this need to combine digital/video games with a narrative was like having your cake and eating it, too.<br />
so it was interesting to see where the class discussion led to tonight, but at the same time i feel like there is this obvious disconnect between computer studies and narratiology, and that this gray area was exactly what "First Person" focused a lot of energy on (or at least the parts I managed to plow through...)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After watching the clip where the stationary bicyclist navigates throughout the city, I began to wonder, if this is art, why don't I think of video games as art? I'm sure a lot of people already do assign (at least certain) videogames as pieces of art but the idea that they would be put in this category has actually never occurred to me. Admittedly, I'm a bit prejudiced against video games and this has probably colored my perception of them as art or non-art pieces. How could Doom possibly be put in the same category as a David or Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Seeing how similar the look of the letter city world we saw in the stationary bicycle piece was to certain video games, however, I was forced to reevaluate.</p>

I am writing about children's television advertising, and I feel as if everything I read is simply saying, "in this way advertising is bad for kids".  This is all good and fine as this is a point that I am going to probably spend around a month arguing, but still at the same time I would like to suggest a future alternative that is a positive step forward from the current system.<br />
	Right now however, I am feeling like I have been hit by the negative train.  Over and over again, because many of the articles and books I have found are saying the same thing.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I used to play lots of Street Fighter Two, as I was a product of being raised with three brothers.  This was the only fighting game I would play. It was likely because I found satisfaction in playing the character of Chin- Lu (I believe that was her name).  Clearly, at the age of 10 I was unaware of the need for identification with a female in a fighting game, but it worked for me.  I would get into a fight with Ryu, and instead of punching him I would run around in circles imaging that he was her boyfriend and they were being forced to fight by some evil controller.<br />
	All fantacies aside for Ryu's fireballs, I wanted their to be an aspect of story in my game.  The only other game I ever got into was Final Fantacy Seven.  Again, this was because of the story behind it.  My brothers on the other hand would likely argue that they enjoyed the fighting aspect of it more.  I was the only one that would take the time to read every character blurb during the narrative parts.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>So, since the blog is so significant to our class, I thought this might be of interest to some of you in the class. I was listening to NPR yesterday and the topic of military blogs was discussed. Basically, a lot of members of the military post blogs as a way to keep in touch with family and friends, as well as using the blog as a way of speaking out about their experiences, kind of like keeping a journal.  Many people see this as a positive way for the general public to stay connected with our military and the war in general.  Well, the government is of course, worried about security. The potential risk of bloggers leaking information about the military strategies has made the military begin to restrict the blogging rights of the troops to prevent potential leaking on blogs. So, basically we trust our troops with guns and defending democracy, but not with a computer and a mouse.   I thought this was interesting. The military is censoring the blogs because they feel the troops could let out information that could harm them or the goals of the U.S. in general. Is the military simply trying to protect the troops? Should the military officers be allowed to control what is on the internet for the safety of our military strategies and troops?  Should blogs in general be censored??</p>

For those of you that dont know, I suggest that you go to RefWorks and make an account ASAP. We may have talked about it in class already, but I believe I may have missed that day.

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>My original project/thesis proposal had decidedly been to broad to be able to pursue in a way that allow for me to really explore effectively. So I researched the topic regarding identity and social networking systems and I concluded that the most pertinent SNS to people my age wre MysSpace and Facebook. And I realized that both were completely different in terms of who joined and how they portrayed themselves. And then Facebook opened up to the public in an attempt to become more inclusive. And Myspace has recenetly allowed for profiles to be blocked to the public. As has facebook. So myspace is becoming more exclusive and facebook more inclusive. Is this an attempt by both to attract both people who lobe being in the public eye and people who desire a greater level of privacy? How does the interface affect the overall usage? And this is how I came to find that what really really really interests me in terms of SNS is how the differences in the type of network design and interface affect the network identities that myspace and facebook users present and how these identities in turn affect the types of connections the users' experience with each other. Do you guys think that this question is something that the average type of user asks themselves when they log on? Do you think they make a conscious effort to project a certain identity or do you think that the site design inherently affects the type of identity presented and thus the type and extent of connections made with other users?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Ken Perlin's essay discusses the differences between characters in media such a film and in video games. He claims that in film and books, the emotions of the character are real enough that we can buy into the avatar living in the real world and thus buy his/her story better. He goes on to state that in video games, this is not the case. The computer generated avatars are too static and don't have the capabilities to act on their own in a realistic manner. Unfortunately I would have to agree with him. </p>

    <div class="content"><p>Janet Murray returns to us to present yet another wonderful piece on the nature of the game vs. puzzle vs. story. She does a very good job of separating these three terms, but as she is using them in reference to everything from scrabble to myst, I wasn't exactly sure if she was addressing all forms of games, or computer games in general. Anyway, I have always seen the narrative computer game as a combination of those three terms. One of the responses to her on pg. 10, declaires that books and films have already established themselves as a perfect medium for story telling, "so if it ain't broke, why fix it?". This got my attention, as in my opinion, the video game can not only tell just as good a story as any other medium using story, but it can incoprorate puzzle and game to enhance the experience.</p>
