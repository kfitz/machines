    <div class="content"><p>Chapter 3 </p>
<p>Modern Japanese Culture, Art and Apathy</p>
<p>	An angle that remains largely unexplored in the study of artistic activism is the result of individual countercultural sentiments without a larger subcultural arts movement within which to unify.  The current artistic and activist climate in Japan allows an examination of countercultural sentiments when surrounding artistic subcultures targeting a mainstream oppressor are absent from the environment.  </p>
<p>	Unlike the high rates of violence in South Africa, criminal activity is rare among youth in Japan.  Yet several other symptoms reflect a different type of alienation from mass culture: Japan's birth rate is among the lowest in the world, while the country suffers more suicides than any other wealthy developed nation.  In 2005, there were roughly 10,000 more deaths than births in Japan, officially marking its shrinking population (Zielenziger 9).  Equally disturbing, Japan has the most hospital patients with mental illnesses of any nation in the world.  The nation's mental institutions record an average stay as over a year long (Zielenziger 142).</p>
<p>	Another trend is emerging to reflect the mass discontent rampant in Japan: hundreds of thousands of young men and women have retreated inside their rooms for years â€“ sometimes 15 or more.  Living with their parents well into adulthood, the hikikomori (Japanese for "one who shuts himself away") stand out from traditional subcultures because their alienation is so strong that they do not bond even with each other (Zielenziger 17).  Hikikomori is estimated to affect over one million Japanese citizens, 800,000 of which are male.  Many psychologists hypothesize that hikikomori cave under Japanese society's immense pressure to assimilate to the norm.  I argue that the dearth of subcultural arts in Japan further aggravates the syndrome, leaving non-conformist individuals with nowhere to turn except inside themselves.</p>
<p> "A Hundred Million People, One Single Mind"</p>
<p>	Post-World War II, Japanese society had much work to do in order to heal its physical and psychological wounds.  A powerful sense of pride and unity emerged from the War, ingrained with the militarist idea, "a hundred million people, one single mind" (Bouissou 203).  As Frank Brandes, Josef Kreiner, Ralph Lutzeler and Hans Dieter Olschleger write in Modern Japanese Society, </p>
<p>	"Following 1945, the desire to define the place and characteristics of 	Japan and Japanese society in the world became a new impetus fueled by defeat in the 	Pacific Warâ€¦The most prominent propositions of [Japanese] identity discourse wereâ€¦uniqueness and homogeneity" (Kreiner et al 220).</p>
<p>Neo-Confucian strains of thought stressed the common good, urging the discipline and self-sacrifice that had inspired kamikaze pilots to give their lives in the name of patriotism during World War II.  These values helped propel Japan's economy to one of the fastest-growing in the world during the second half of the twentieth century.  </p>
<p>	Simultaneously, post-War patriotism fostered an unrealistic sense of homogeneity.  Thirteen years after the 1966 United Nations adaptation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Japan ratified the Covenant with the following disclaimer:</p>
<p>	"The right of any person to enjoy his own culture, to profess and practice his religion or to use his own language is ensured under Japanese law.  However, minorities of the kind mentioned in the Covenant do not exist in Japan" (Kreiner et al 219)</p>
<p>This pervasive rejection of difference applied not only to ethnic and religious minorities, but also to those Japanese who did not feel part of the nation's "one single mind" (Bouissou 203).  Today, author of Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation Michael Zielenziger states that Japanese society demands "conformity, restraint, and acquiescence" from its citizens.  </p>
<p>	The pressure to conform for Japanese citizens extends well beyond classic national similarities.  90% of Japanese citizens identify themselves as "middle class" (Bouissou 203), leaving only the 5% richest and poorest citizens self-classifying as anything other than wholly average.  Keeping up with fashion trends is a necessity, even though most last for no more than two weeks.  The Saison Research Institute found the 94% of women in Tokyo own at least one Louis Vuitton purchase, a designer item many wait in line for days to acquire (Zielenziger 148).  While traveling in Japan, Zielenziger gathered several explanations for this phenomenon.  He writes,</p>
<p>	"Some analysts told me that in their cultish passion for brand-name 	products, young Japanese were demonstrating their fundamental distrust in traditional institutions.  As the Japanese system of social control â€“ through discipline, hard work, scrimping, and self-denial â€“ began to fray, people's natural impulses began to stir.  As the nation grew affluentâ€¦[young people] began to develop a visceral hunger to indulge self and to seek some deeper meaning from the world around them.  Yet, this search could be easily channeled into a fascination for luxury goods and a fetish for conspicuous consumption" (152).</p>
<p>Zielenziger's statement begs the question: why must Japanese youth turn to materialism for a "deeper meaning?"  What third factor is present in other cultures, yet missing in Japan?</p>
<p>Media Consolidation</p>
<p>Like the U.S., Japan went through a period of swift deregulation over the past two decades, as "each government surpassed the one before in 'deregulatory rhetoric'" (Bouissou 277).  The tactic was seen as a way to lower prices and jumpstart the economy without increasing the deficit with a tax cut.  Between 1995 and 2000, the percentage of conglomerate financial institutions tripled from 7% to 21% (Nicolo et al).  Though this deregulation was protested as "an obstacle to reforms" (Bouissou 277), the process nonetheless continued.</p>
<p>	Like any consolidation of ownership, deregulation in Japan resulted in greater exposure for mainstream media corporations, and less diversity overall.  As Jason Testar writes in the Japan Media Review, "Even with specialized content and smaller news outlets in play online, the trend of media consolidation worldwide has meant fewer media owners and fewer actual outlets. This, in turn, reduces competition and encourages content sharingâ€¦"  In such a climate, underground or independent subcultures are the first to lose footing, and mass-produced, commercialized media fills the niche.  Even Mark Schilling, the author of The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture, writes, </p>
<p>	"Despite its domination of the local market, Japanese pop culture often gets no respect, for good reason.  It is frequently banal, vulgar, derivative, and utterly commercialized.  Television, with its legions of untalented 	talents mugging on lowest-common -denominator quiz and variety shows, is perhaps the worst offender, but the music, movie, and manga industries are little better.  Often the only aim is to extract the maximum amount of yen from the product while paying minimal attention to the quality of the content, aesthetic or moral" (11).</p>
<p>"J-Pop" </p>
<p>	These trends are reflected in both mass media sales data and scholarship.  The Recording Industry Association of Japan reports that in 2005, pop music dominated over 70% of new music releases.  The Motion Pictures Producers Association of Japan reports that the 7,457 movie screens in Japan in 1960 have steadily shrunk to 2,926 in 2005, reflecting less diversity in releases.  While in 1960 Japan produced well over twice as many films as it imported from foreign producers, in 2005 more foreign films were screened than domestic (Facts and Figures of Japan 2006).  </p>
<p>	Jean-Marie Bouissou writes that the peak of cinema in Japan occurred around 1958, "but its creativity was beginning to be constrained by the four big production companies, which imposed very repetitive successful genresâ€¦The standardization was soon to bring about a general decline in the Japanese cinema" (Bouissou 112-113).  The Art Theatre Guild, called "the most important producer of Japanese independent movies" and many protest films of the 60s and early 70s, went bankrupt in 1975 as more standardized and commercialized films took the spotlight (Domenig).  Bouissou comments, "The few strong films of this period often depicted personalities gone adrift, without any aim in life (Yoichi Higashi's The Third Base, 1978) or engaged on fatal moral decline punctuated by orgies of violence (Shohei Imamura's Revenge is for Us, 1979)" (205).  The post-World War II mirage of unity and restraint has for many Japanese youth faded well before the popped bubble economy of the 1990s.  </p>
<p>	While deregulation perhaps boosted the sales of empty, over-commercialized products, their popularity also demonstrates a sense of nihilism pervading post-baby boomer Japanese citizens.  The trend towards increasingly profit-driven and low-brow mass culture has been developing for several decades.  Bouissou writes that "Two-thirds of the 300 films produced in 1980 were cheap erotic productions, while the leading directors no longer found producers" (Bouissou 204).  Books sales further reflected the mass despondency felt in Japan.  Ryu Murakami, a famous author and winner of the Akutagawa Prize, explains his work as "the drama of a generation which no longer believes in anything" (Bouissou 205).</p>
<p>Mounting Indifference</p>
<p>	This pervasive apathy is evident beyond mainstream media representations.  By 1980 over one out of every three voters felt ambiguous about political parties, whether left, right, or center.  What could be interpreted as a sign of satisfaction with society could also be seen as growing indifference to the surrounding world.  Many youth seem to have given up on the possibility to proactively change the political or social climate around them.  Bouissou writes:</p>
<p>	"This new mentalityâ€¦led to the rejection of radicalism and the abandonment of the will to 'change the world.'  In 1980, 46% of the young 	thought that no general improvement in life was possible (compared with 	36% in 1970), while three quarters of Japanese said they were 'content' 	with the present state of society" (Bouissou 204).</p>
<p>	For those truly content with "J-Pop" fashions, movies, music and books, the cultural climate in Japan leaves little to be desired.  But manga and pop stars are not for everyone, and the remaining quarter of discontented society has few alternate options.  Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist Zielenziger spoke with while in Japan, expressed frustration with what he perceived as superficiality in Japanese pastimes:</p>
<p>	"'In order to fill the void' between worldliness and true inner peace, Yamada said, 'all [we Japanese] can do is read manga, take trips abroad, or go shopping.  It's awful.  Shopping becomes an addiction, a 	tranquilizer'" (Yamada, qtd in Zielenziger 157).</p>
<p>People like Yamada are often best off hiding their dissent.  Any sign of dissatisfaction or attempt to improve upon tradition is viewed harshly as an insult to Japanese culture.  Journalists complain that they work all day not to seize the next big story, but to report identical stories as every other publication.  One Japanese journalist told Zielenziger, "If you demonstrate 'reason' or 'logic' that differs from the group's, 'it is very dangerous.  You could be killed for it' (291).  </p>
<p>	Social activism in general is largely frowned upon in Japan.  Zielenziger relates the story of three Japanese humanitarian workers who had been kidnapped and held hostage for three weeks by insurgents in Iraq.  Upon their return the humanitarians were greeted with signs with slogans like "You got what you deserved!" at the airport, and a $6000 airfare bill from the government.  Instead of feeling pride and empathy for the activists, many Japanese instead felt that the workers had inconvenienced and betrayed their nation by entering harm's way to help another.  After their traumatizing experience, the three activists saw psychiatrist Satoru Saito, who later reported that the weight of the stress caused by their fellow citizens was "much heavier" than that caused by the Iraqi rebels (Zielenziger 291).</p>
<p>Hikikomori: The Anti-Movement</p>
<p>	The sense of emptiness seen in Japanese popular culture is most vividly reflected by the million Japanese citizens who refuse to leave their homes.  A culture-driven syndrome sometimes compared to anorexia in Western societies, hikikomori is specific to Eastern countries and especially Japan, where counter-mainstream representations are more repressed.  While "misfit" teens in other regions can turn to any number of subcultures for a like-thinking community, in Japan an outlier is vanquished from acceptance in social circles.  Hikikomori is sometimes referred to as an 'adjustment disorder' in Japan â€“ implying that all youth must adjust to mainstream social norms.  Social outcasts, loners, rebels and those who simply fail to assimilate risk being ostracized as social pariahs.</p>
<p>	The strict, rigid social groups created by the post-War emphasis on conformity and restraint do not make it easy for hikikomori to reenter into society.  As Zielenziger describes it, </p>
<p>	"The hikikomori are, in their lonely darkened rooms, painfully impaled on the points of a psychic triangle.  Though desperate to free themselves 	from their nation's rigid educational, employment, and social patterns, they 	know that if they choose the risky route of personal 'emancipation' and 	flee into the sunshine, they will be doubly punished.  Shunned by the 	school or work group from which they have withdrawn, they likely may find no other network or group willing to accept them.  They feel certain that 	few strangers will reach out to help them find a new path.  And without membership in any group, shorn of social context, these hikikomori have 	precious little identity on which to fall back." (142)</p>
<p>Outcasts are no strange phenomenon elsewhere in the world.  But youth disenchanted with other societies inevitably find a subcultural community with which they can relate.  Whether it be punk, goth, hippie or grunge, a subculture unites around artistic expression.  The symbols, sights and sounds of a subculture broadcast their asymmetry with the mainstream, inviting anyone with a common understanding of difference to join.  These underground groups serve the indispensable function of providing community for those who long for more than what mass culture provides.  This safety net is absent from the Japanese social landscape.</p>
<p>	As the hikikomori are not unified in any way, each man and woman came to the decision, on his or her own, to retreat from society.  Research on the cause of this social withdrawal syndrome is therefore sparse and largely based in theory.  The only common sentiment we can be sure of among all hikikomori is a feeling of alienation from mainstream society.  The mother of a hikikomori told Zielenziger, </p>
<p>	"Hikikomori are kids who value intangiblesâ€¦ Hikikomori can see the intangibles, but cannot speak out because there is no place in Japanese 	society that allows them toâ€¦So a person who challenges, or makes a mistake, or thinks for himself, either leaves Japan or becomes a hikikomori" (18).</p>
<p>In a culture arguably more materialistic and homogeneous than most, the absence of visible and acceptable counterculture movements could be a significant factor in the hikikomori's decision to resort to such drastic behavior.  Support groups for emerging recluses, substituting for absent social groups, can sometimes provide the sense of belonging and understanding the hikikomori need.  Subcultural arts from outside Japan can also provide a vital landline to social belonging.  As one recovering hikikomori told New York Times Magazine reporter Maggie Jones, "Don't laugh, but musicians really helped me, especially Radioheadâ€¦That's what encouraged me to leave my room.'"</p>
