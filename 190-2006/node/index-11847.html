    <div class="content"><p>This past Monday the Metropolitan Opera in New York City decided to simulcast the opening night of their production of Puccini's <em>Madama Butterfly</em> in Times Square.  The streets were closed down, 650 cushioned seats were assembled, and the event was open to the public.  There was a second simulcast in Lincoln Center Plaza where tickets were required, but handed out for free at the box office before the event.  </p>
<p>Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said he wanted to end the "isolation" of the art form, "It's essential for the broader public to know what's going on inside.  I want to demonstrate that the Met is interested in being part of mainstream society and contemporary culture" (http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/5228.html).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>So I have been mulling over thesis for a months now and have now come up with a new idea. Initially I began to toy with it when Facebook brought us the News Feed a few weeks ago but when it opened up to the public a few days ago, I pretty much decided this is somewhere I wanted to go with thesis. SO anyway, previously I had wanted to write about the publics increasing desire to participate in the authorship of media (ex Snakes on a Plane) and how this could potentially affect media in the  future. But now, I'd like to maybe write about the overexposure of personal information through networks sch as myspace and facebook and how that affects identity. I would definitely have to take into account the publics reaction on new facebook features, such as the news feed and public access. I'm beginning to wonder why facebook is trying harder and harder to become some sort of myspace when what I used to like about it is that it was different enough for me to want to join it. I guess we'll have to see how recent decisions regarding its layout will change who joins it and who doesnt, and maybe even who leaves it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Thursday at lunch in Oldenborg there is a ridiculously interesting talk on hikikomori in Japan.  The hikikomori are hundreds of thousands of men (and some women) in Japan who have locked themselves in their rooms in their parents homes, starting as early as age 13 or 14, and some staying their entire lives without further social contact with the world.  It's not a movement, it's more of a syndrome, and like anorexia in western cultures it only sprouts up in areas with certain social pressures.  In Japan, young men are pressured to succeed in school and come out on top of the stagnant economy.  Countercultural sentiments are looked down upon, leaving youth who would normally turn to goth, punk or hardcore in american culture feeling alone in their distance from mass culture.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This week in my US Popular Culture class at Pitzer we have been discussing the advent of the television and its impact on popular culture and American society.  Iin class, I found myself virtually unable to imagine the era before television.  For so many people today, the television forms such a fundamental aspect of daily life that I think its power often goes unnoticed.  I mean, we plan meals around primetime, we arrange our furniture to accommodate for the television (which is more often than not the focal point), and we rely on the television to provide us with our daily source of news and entertainment. Though I have never been much of a TVaholic, I still find it hard to imagine life without its existence. As perhaps the most pervasive form of popular culture, it is fascinating to learn how fast and hard we all fell for the comforting glow of this monumental technological advancement.</p>

<p>...Bueller? .....Bueller?  Anyone?</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about cookbooks, the recipes in them, and what makes them unique or different from predecessors, and what makes traditional recipes worth revising.  Obviously there are a lot of questions we can raise here: What constitutes enough change for a recipe to be made new?  Is the substitution of cream cheese for animal lard enough?  Adding an extra clove of garlic?  Setting the oven at a lower temperature and cooking a dish for 10 extra minutes?  Or is it the intent of a revision that makes it different, such as making a pesto using low fat parmesan (does this even exist?) for inclusion in a low-fat cookbook?  Who exactly authored pesto, anyway?  We all know pesto as an established foodthing, but what constitutes it, and what constitutes a revision?</p>

<p>1.	Further develop the idea of literary genre transformations online<br />

                  i.	very interesting/creative<br />
                  ii.	sort of involves nostalgia in a wayïƒ rekindling my sensations and love for how I experienced reading and school projects &amp; then trying to recreate that for others [dioramas; Mrs. Thomas's videos (We made videos that synthesizes literature we read, involving game shows, etc.); mind maps; Mrs. Jasek's vocab. &amp; academic decathlon (repetition and usage but in a fun way); etc.]</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Over the summer I worked for a children's television production company in England called Granada Kids.  We primarily produced television shows for ITV which is England's second major television network channel following the BBC.  The BBC is government funded while ITV is commercial.  While I was working at Granada the department was told it was to be shut down.  ITV was no longer making enough profit from children's television to sustain development and production of new shows.  They are going to continue making game shows because of the low budget nature, but all other children's television programming was going to be cancelled by next spring.  As far as public television goes this leaves the BBC with a monopoly on children's programming.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I met with my potential first reader for thesis, I was very impressed with his ideas for simple, yet practical applications of media to education. The ideas particularly resounded with me, because over the summer I had an internship at the University of California, San Diego, in their Professional Development Institute, which dealt with helping teachers better their techniques. We held a conference for the Los Angeles Unified School District (Local District 6) for ESL (English as a Second Language) kids, as well as a retreat for a new charter school that didn't know how to find resources. Both could use simple applications of media to help kids in their classroom and find administrative resources. Also, I read some e-newsletters on the use of technology and education with input from teachers on what worked for them, and my potential thesis reader's ideas were very much inline with the ideas teachers reported worked best. Here are some of his ideas:</p>

He works for the Foreign Language Department, teaching one German class, but he is also responsible for integrating technology into classroom learning, particularly in language conversation classes. He is really an interesting guy, and I am almost positive that he should be my first reader. This is because my interests dovetail with his pretty well. Furthermore, he is the only faculty member I have found who deals with both media and education directly, which is why I am considering someone I hadn't even met yet to be my first reader.</p>

Most of the support/pressure is still coming from outside of the fashion industry, but a few designers and modeling agencies have rallied behind the organizers of the Madrid Fashion Week.
