    <div class="content"><p>I went to that lunch with one of the new potential profs yesterday and she got me thinking about a topic I don't feel we talk about much as media studies majors â€“ children and the media. She compared regular schools with Montessori and Waldorf schools (which severely limit if not totally eliminate) media in the classroom and said she much prefers the regular schools' system of media exposure. (Apparently, Waldorf schools even go so far as to prohibit the families of the children from owning a television!) The professor was definitely very against these policies. She said she would never send her child to a school like that because they go so against what she believes in. She felt that so much of children's play stems from things children have seen on TV shows and in other media that it would be wrong to prohibit children from having access to movies, television, etc. </p>
<p>Personally, I did not grow up completely media-less but my mom was pretty adamant that I not see commercials which left quite slim pickings for television. Basically I watched the Disney Channel and PBS and that was it. As a child, however, I didn't base any of the games I made up with my friends on the shows that I watched. I must admit, however, that the plotlines of our play was rarely fully original as most were modeled after the classical fairytale â€“ someone would be the princess, prince charming would be there, usually an evil step-motherâ€¦ you know the routine. Other imaginary play was based off of what we thought was a "normal household" and, of course, we'd all fight over who got to be the cool big sister. </p>
<p>Based on my own experience, I'm not completely convinced that media really has a huge function in child's play, nor that it would detract from someone's childhood if they did not interact with it. Are our imaginations not good enough to come up fun games to play and stories to act out on our own? Wouldn't it be better for children to be forced to be creative in these ways rather than just picking up where Full House left off? (Uh oh, maybe I'd better start saving up for Waldorf).</p>
<p>I'd be really interested to know what all of your backgrounds are in terms of how much media you were exposed to as children and where or not you feel like this had a role in your play. Do you think it is better to have to come up with imaginary worlds wholly your own without the aid of media or do you think not having access to media as a child detracts from your overall experience?</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by gwen on 1 December 2006 - 10:49pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I agree, I was surprised the professor had such a strong pro-tv stance.  But I don't entirely disagree with her.  My parents went a little overboard with the sheltering - as a kid I wasn't allowed to watch tv, and I wasn't told about the existence of candy until my motherâ€™s friend spilled the beans one Halloween when I returned home to show off my â€œtrinkets.â€  I definitely wouldn't go this far raising my children.  As a result of missing all those informative Barney episodes, I grew up noticably more naive than my friends.  My brother argued with me for years before I would agree that men were physically stronger than women.  I thought that Canada was below the US until fifth grade (that's embarrassing...).  There are lots of social cues people take from television that I never really picked up on.  And I think I was struck hard by the whole girls-are-supposed-to-be-sweet-and-sexy thing  in middle school because I had no connection to celebrities or really any social guidance outside my own sphere of interactions.</p>
<p>Still, now I have more time than many of my friends because I never got into the habit of watching tv, and I never got wrapped up in celebrity gossip or fashion.  I would say fairly strict tv rules for children are a good thing, because there is a lot more to do than sit in front of a tv 6 hours a day (that's the national average isn't it?) and most sitcoms squeeze women and minorities into pretty tight stereotypes.  But overly strict rules are too likely to create rebellion, or at least a dumb little kid like me.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by bloggityblog07 on 4 December 2006 - 12:23am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I have a friend at school that went to Waldorf school through elementary. I guess you can go as long as high school, but I think a lot of kids go to "regular" school after elementary. While my friend turned out perfectly "normal," suffered no permanent damage, and displays no serious social handicaps, I do think there is a value in some of the more "traditional" schooling techniques. Man I love the quotes tonight. Anyway, I think if you are going to live in a media saturated world, I think it is essential for media literacy to become familiar with these things at an early age. Of course there is always that possibility of brain wash too. Hmm. Waldorf schools also don't believe in homework. I like the sound of that.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by oneoutofseven on 4 December 2006 - 9:25pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I completely relate to your early television deprivation.  I think I was allowed to watch half an hour of television a week until I was in 7th grade or something...  and I didn't really miss it, I just, you know, didn't understand until much, much later that when my friends and I played 90210 on the school yard, I always got suckered into playing the ugly girls.  Whatever.</p>
<p>At any rate, I think now, more than ever, it's important to limit young children's access to programmed media.  I also think it's important to give children experience in media production from an early age to build familiarity and media literacy to help them understand the behind-the-scenes manipulation lurking behind every toy commercial.  </p>
<p>I have no idea how my experiences would've been different had I been more seriously exposed at an early age to television.  I don't, however, feel like I had any lack in childhood in that regard that wasn't superficial: sometimes I felt left out when a few kids were talking about some new toy, for instance, or when I didn't understand the 90210 storylines we were trying to re-enact on the playground.  I guess I just don't see how these are absolutely negative experiences-- obviously I had to adjust and grow from them, and I think ultimately I was forced to be more imaginative in play because of them.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by lrob on 5 December 2006 - 1:44am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Wow, that's funny that your mom used to make you watch the Disney Channel to AVOID commercials. I've gotten a little too familiar with that network while babysitting over the past few years, and the amount of commercials they run is absolutely crazy.  And they're all the kind of commercials that get kids BEGGING to have that particular toy or to watch that particular show.  Disney's always struck me as a really commercial company in general...they'll pitch anything if it makes them some extra bank.  But maybe it hasn't always been that way.  I don't know, because I didn't watch the Disney Channel until I was in college (as a babysitter).  Weird, huh?</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I watched a ton of PBS... Sesame Street, Shining Time Station, Reading Rainbow, 3-2-1 Contact, and Where in the World is Carmen San Diego were favorites (man, that's a lot of shows).  I also watched the Saturday morning cartoons and TGIF religiously.  But my parents definitely "censored" what I saw -- for instance, The Simpsons and Married with Children were not allowed until I was in high school.  They also hated it when I watched Friends or Dawson's Creek, which they said were "all about sex."  To be honest, I'm not sure whether or not my parents did the right or wrong thing.  I think they were a little strict and overprotective at times, but that's what happens when you grow up in Texas with Christian parents.  That said, I still think I ended up pretty well.  I think TV is fine as long as you set some limits (so your kids aren't on the couch ALL the time) and balance it with books and other forms of media.  Everything in moderation.</p>
