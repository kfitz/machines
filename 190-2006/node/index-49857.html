It's a work in progress and I intend to continue adding to it. I plan to use it in my thesis presentation, provided I get approval to persue an Honors thesis (fingers crossed).</p>
<p>So I'd really like feedback. On the interface, on the content, whatever comes to mind. I'd also love suggestions for other public artworks to include.</p>

Would this be something I'd need to check in with a psych prof for so I can make sure I have a proper method for collecting data, etc? I've never taken a psych class so I really have no idea about this stuff. Thanks for your help, guys!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Thinking about copyrights, and in general the rights to one's creation, got me wondering about patent laws.  I was surprised when I looked it up to find that patents only last twenty years, and in the US you have to renew them after 3 1/2, 7 1/2, &amp; 11 1/2 years.  Apparently you can renew them again after 20 years, but each time you renew there is a fee.  I had no idea patent laws were so short.  This might make me change my views about copyright laws.  </p>
<p>Who Killed the Electric Car? is also making me question my stance.  The documentary interviews an old inventor who came up with a battery that would allow an electric car to drive 300 miles on one charge (making it a better choice than gas-fueled vehicles for just about everyone).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I went to that lunch with one of the new potential profs yesterday and she got me thinking about a topic I don't feel we talk about much as media studies majors -- children and the media. She compared regular schools with Montessori and Waldorf schools (which severely limit if not totally eliminate) media in the classroom and said she much prefers the regular schools' system of media exposure. (Apparently, Waldorf schools even go so far as to prohibit the families of the children from owning a television!) The professor was definitely very against these policies. She said she would never send her child to a school like that because they go so against what she believes in. She felt that so much of children's play stems from things children have seen on TV shows and in other media that it would be wrong to prohibit children from having access to movies, television, etc.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was torn on the copyright discussion earlier.  It seems to me that artists often get the short end of the stick monetarily.  Think of all your mediocre friends headed to wall street, and then all your amazing and insightful artist friends who are headed towards the starving category.  I agree that artists should be able to borrow each others' work if they cite it (any press is good press anyway), but I think artists should get paid each time their work is viewed/heard/read.  And I don't see the problem with an artist's kids getting the money after their death.  A businessman usually earns enough to pass a chunk down to his children.</p>

As you've probably been able to tell from my previous posts, I take a lot of breaks from work doing useless things like reading about Paris Hilton, exploring new magazine options, and obsessing over Eric Cartman and the rest of the South Park kiddos.  In any case, if you find yourself needing a little pick-me-up, check out Cuteoverload.com.  At first it may seem strange, but you'll get sucked in, I promise.  These people are hardcore about cute things, and have even developed their own language of cuteness, including words like baroo and muzzlepuff (admit, you're curious now, aren't you?).  There's even a glossary of terms if you get confused.  The website won a Webby Award (People's Voice Winner) for 2006, and has links to other websites dedicated to all things cute and fuzzy (although the rest pale in comparison, trust me).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Because people have been talking about celebrities and American culture in general, I thought this magazine article (taken, again, from BUST) would be appropriate.</p>
<p>In the Pop Tart section, Wendy McClure tackles the issue of "Why do we obsess over Paris Hilton?"  And, to be honest, for as much as I hate Paris Hilton, I find that I'm also obsessed with her.  Maybe it's because I love laughing at her, or thinking about how many ways I could make better use of her money, but in any case, I keep tabs on the girl.  McClure writes: "Every time I've considered writing a column about Paris Hilton I've talked myself out of it.  Because one day soon, I figure, she's going to drop off the pop-culture radar.  It's inevitable, right?  She'll just disappear into a puff of pink smoke- gone, forgotten, nothing left but a bittersweet memory and a T-Mobile Sidekick."  But no matter how much we belittle Paris, tell her that she's like "a fart in a mitten" (someone actually said that, how genius?!), she sticks around, and we have no one to blame but ourselves.  McClure writes that we need to stop blaming Paris for starting a trend of celebrities who are famous for no apparent reason, and start looking at why we've produced a culture which values this sort of person.  "Maybe we ought to stop wondering how we should feel about her and wonder instead how we got to this particularly fucked-up place in time- where being young and female and famous seems to mean becoming somebody most other people would love to pelt with dog shit."  As McClure rightly points out, perhaps the reason that Paris is sticking around for so long (and the reason that another Paris will pop up on the scene when this one is done and gone) is because of the sort of fame we've created.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>the blog, as expected is always post heavy monday to wednesday. it's time to give the other days some lovin'!</p>
<p>I was working at the QRC, and stumbled on some comic books drawn by Erika Moen, who graduated from Pitzer last year. She designed her own major, "Illustrated Storytelling". Her work is really fun and interesting. She took a bunch of different classes in art, English, creative writing, etc. With film and music, we've talked about how collaborative it is, because you need all these different people with different skills. It's intersting that in comic books, you need the different skills, but you can do it all yourself (though there are many classes where it's more collaborative, or uses a team of people for production).</p>

Did I write this and just leave it sitting out for all to see? What has been on my mind in the last few months? How bad would it be if someone has read this??? I soon see that there is a note from my mom. Of course, the fear factor soars.</p>
