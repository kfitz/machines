    <div class="content"><p>If anyone has heard John Mayer's new album "Continuum" (which if you don't want admit, that's alright), you may have noticed that it is maybe a little bit, well maybe, sort of errrr... okay.  And by okay, I mean okay in that same way that some Gwen Stefani songs are okay: though you feel like you should know better, somehow these songwriters are able to engage that small "audio crack" receptor in the brain, and you can't stop listening to them no matter how hard you try  to go back to your usual playlists.</p>
<p>So yesterday, because I was so surprised at suddenly liking John Mayer again, I decided to go in search of more information--and where better to turn than www.johnmayer.com!  The site, as most artist sites now are, was a jumble of text, video, images and audio clips, and interestingly enough, a blog.  Obviously, I had explore.</p>
<p>Here's where things got interesting.  Within the space of the thirty minutes of reading John Mayer's blog, I a) felt shame and fright that someone might come into the room and know I was thinking about liking John Mayer, b) thought he was a genius in his latest blog entry about the Borat movie (seriously, go read it, it's great), and c) was thoroughly charmed by the sentence: "And if you're still wondering what leg I have to stand on with this, just remember: I was truly hip for three weeks back in 2001."  Uhm, amazing.  I was ready to go out and sing the John Mayer Gospel all over campus.</p>
<p>But then I found excerpts from his first book, "The Pioneer".  And then I found out he really likes Keane and says that song "Is It Any Wonder?" is "rocking his cranial jukebox".  Oh no.  Celebrity blog TMI.</p>
<p>This is an example of one of the strangest things about blogs, particularly celebrity blogs: suddenly, we're far closer to these figures than was ever before imaginable.  Worse than writing e-letters to fan club members (a la Britney Spears), blogs allow artists a freedom from discretion and self-censorship that perhaps could be done without.  </p>
<p>So now, in regards to John Mayer (I know you were wondering), I'm back to where I started.  It is obviously still definitely uncool to admit that I've played his cover of "Bold as Love" 30 times since acquiring the album half a month ago, and I certainly can't share with my friends what I've been listening to lately (though I have already been thoroughly chastised by those weirdos who audio-stalk me on AudioScrobbler).  Maybe that's the thing about blogs--they always confirm what you kinda sort of already maybe know, but you've just got to explore, just in case.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Wow. You told me you were going to blog about John Mayer. And I laughed. And then you did. Well done. Couple of things:</p>
<p>1) I am going to start using the phrase "rocking my cranial jukebox" waaaaaaaaaay more often now. </p>
<p>2) Can you send me the "Bold as Love" cover. Mayer's a rocking guitarist and I'd love to hear how he treats Hendrix.</p>
<p>3) How do you know about the Britney Spears fan e-mails? Is there something else you need to tell us?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>1) If you do that you will be plagiarizing John Mayer and perhaps the only thing worse than liking John Mayer is plagiarizing John Mayer so BuildingsAndFood/Carter, don't do it!</p>
<p>2) As a matter of fact, as Mayer himself notes: "Say what you will about my words, my voice, my behavior but end it up with 'But I gotta hand it to the guy, he can play' and I'm cool."  It looks like you guys are on the same page!</p>
<p>3) Because I am a Media Studies major and it is my job to know about these things, WHAT.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by BuildingsAndFood on 12 November 2006 - 9:36pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>1) It's a great phrase. And I'm really more covering John Mayer, something you don't seem to have a problem with when John Mayer does it, oneoutofseven/Ashley! Plus, there's nothing wrong with ripping off the genius who wrote, "They read all the books, but they can't find the answers." Deep.</p>
<p>2) I totally forgot about his behavior. He's such an asshole, but I guess I'm kind of glad that he knows it. </p>
<p>3) I don't buy it. I think that you're a closeted Britney Spears fan and that when you were in middle school, you were signed up to her electronic fan club and you used to write her personal e-mails, just waiting for the day when she would write you back, but all you ever got were mass e-mails to everyone and now you're trying to take it out on Britney for neglecting you all those years. Well I'm calling you out. What.</p>
