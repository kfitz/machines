</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>For what it's worth, here's my thesis proposal.  It's all over the place but it's my best stab at what I'm really passionate about...</p>
<p>Apathy is Domesticated Madness:<br />
Counterculture Arts as the Fuel of Activism</p>
<p>	Apathy, defined for the purpose of this exploration as indifference to one's surrounding society, is a concept closely associated with youth in many areas throughout the world.  Yet some of the most passionate and powerful movements in history have been spearheaded by youth, from the Civil Rights movement in the US to the Soweto riots in South Africa.  The foundations of these movements were not built from dry political debates that apathetic youth ignore, but rather from artistic protest: musical and theatrical demonstrations rejecting subordination and seeking justice.  </p>
<p>	I propose to study countercultural arts produced and consumed by youth in several cultures, focusing on whether youth deeply involved with subcultural arts are also likely to be more politically and socially active.  I plan juxtapose three differing cultures and subcultural reactions against them.  I will concentrate on the United States, where political and musical subcultures that emerged during the sixties and seventies to oppose Vietnam now function to oppose the war in Iraq, South Africa, where during apartheid protest artists provided the voice for the suffering black majority, and in Japan, where over a million youth have hidden to their rooms for years and decades, retreating from mainstream culture and all social activity.  While the United States' and South Africa's countercultural arts provide an outlet and unity for those youth who oppose the mainstream cultures, in Japan there is a perceived dearth of countercultural art to reflect feelings of alienation.  My hypothesis is that communities that thrive on artistic protest provide an outlet for countercultural feelings which does not exist sufficiently in Japan.  I further hypothesize that the presence of countercultural art accompanies or incites increased political activism in the surrounding community.</p>
<p>	If possible, I hope to look at the differences between protest art during Vietnam and Iraq (a slight tangent from my original lens, but which could provide an interesting angle from which to approach the study of subcultures and activism).  Vietnam War documentaries such as the 1974 Academy Award winner "Hearts and Minds" were both controversial and popular, and as a result antiwar art proved an intelligent marketing decision for media distributors.  As Evan Medow, CEO of Windswept Pacific music publishing company, says, "At the time [of Vietnam], it was a moneymaking proposition to be involved with countercultural artistsâ€¦Antiwar music was more the order of the day."  Today, he continues, "The music business is under attack on every conceivable level, with downloading and new technologies like streaming video and broadbandâ€¦Record companies want to get control of their product. They're not going to take risks just for the sake of making a political statement. With things the way they are, you're not going to get the adventuresome thinking necessary to put out political music" (Rudman).  </p>
<p>	While mainstream corporations might have abandoned socially conscious media, the call for artistic protest has not disappeared for those living during the Iraq war.  Emerging digital video technology and affordable editing software have allowed independent artists throughout the nation to create their own protest art, distributed throughout independent and underground labels, theatres, and communities.  Eli Kaufman, an independent director of a short film about the war, states, "Hollywood is not going to make films it believes are offensive to their consumers to watch," Kaufman said. "So therefore, the door is open to smaller filmmakers that don't have to be beholden to big box office sales. It's a nice little opening for indie filmmakers. The same thing that inspires me to make film is what detracts big studios from making films" (Rudman).  The result is fiercely liberal undercurrents of art such as the independent documentary "Occupation: Dreamland" and Hoyt Hilsman's play, "Back-Channel."  If at all possible, it would be interesting to compare levels of dissent during Vietnam and Iraq wars, and relate the results to the level of artistic protest (corporate or DIY) at the time.</p>
<p>	The second third of my thesis will focus on political activism in South Africa.  During apartheid, protest art in South Africa provided a voice for the struggle of its people.  As John Kani, an accomplished South African actor and playwright describes it, "Pre-1994, all black South African artists were aware that our number one responsibility was to live in a free and democratic South Africa. So whatever kind of artists we were - painters, musicians, sculptors, poets, or actors - our work somehow echoed our desire and passion for freedom" (John Kani).  I will study the use and effects of protest art in South Africa while apartheid was in effect.</p>
<p>	Also leading the South African protest theatre movement is Bongani Linda, director of the Victory Sonqoba Theatre Company in Alexandra.  Linda, born in Alexandra in 1966, began scripting and directing anti-apartheid plays as a teenager.  He now works to unite conflicting groups through theatre and music, organizing competitions that bring together those formerly divided by apartheid both racially and economically.  Linda's program also serves "to help uncover the latent talents of the rehabilitated and the unemployed youth" (Bongani Linda).  I will study the effects of Linda's theatre program on youth, critically determining whether the medium motivates youth to redirect their lives with respect to political or social activism.</p>
<p>	I will also study Garth Japhet's Soul City, a multimedia organization that seeks to effect positive social change through the most popular television and radio programs in the country.  Using media to broadcast drama in South Africa and eight other nearby nations, Soul City is the largest development communication organization in Africa.  Garth Japhet chose to create television dramas because they are the most popular form of entertainment in the nation, and because theatre has been historically influential in South Africa as a medium for positive change.  Soul City's programs cover HIV/AIDS, violence against women, racism and other current issues in South Africa, provoking thought and discussion among its viewers.  I plan to study the creative processes that contribute to Soul City's programming as well as gauge responses to the programs.  I will explore whether the popularity of Soul City's programming does in fact translate to increased tolerance and awareness in its viewers.</p>
<p>	South Africa is the ideal country in which to study the use of theatre as a catalyst for social change.  Nearly five decades of apartheid left the nation with harsh racial tensions, yet five decades of resistance have provided South Africans with the momentum to enact massive social change.  Films about racism, AIDS, poverty and gang violence are exploding in the country, highlighted by Tsotsi's Best Foreign Language Oscar and the American Film Institute's Silverdocs "Celebrate South Africa" festival (Duke).  Arts and education organizations such as Tomorrow Trust, Victory Sonqoba, and Soul City are well situated to influence public perceptions and actions with regard to the most important social issues in South Africa today. </p>
<p>	One distinction I will have left to explore after looking at subcultural arts movements in the U.S. and South Africa is the difference between individual counterculture sentiments and a unified counterculture movement.  In Japan, I will have an opportunity to focus on the results of countercultural sentiments when a surrounding artistic subculture is absent from the picture.  Criminal activity is rare among youth in Japan, but another symptom of countercultural torment is rampant: hundreds of thousands of young men and women called hikikomori lock themselves in their rooms for years â€“ sometimes 15 or more.  Living with their parents well into adulthood, the hikikomori of Japan stand out from traditional subcultures because their alienation is so strong that they do not bond even with each other.  A culture-driven syndrome (like anorexia in Western societies), hikikomori is specific to Eastern countries, where countercultural representations are more repressed.  Michael Zielenziger, author of "Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created its Own Lost Generation" states that Japanese society demands "conformity, restraint, and acquiescence" from its youth.  While "misfit" teens in other cultures can turn to any number of subcultures for community, in Japan an outlier is immediately vanquished as a social pariah.  Hikikomori is sometimes referred to as an "adjustment disorder" in Japan â€“ implying that all youth must adjust to mainstream society (Zielenziger).</p>
<p>	As estimates of hikikomori in Japan reach over one million, a culture of support for the withdrawal syndrome has emerged as well.  I hope to study support gatherings for recovering hikikomori in Japan, like those organized by the nonprofit Newstart in Urayasu.  I hope to learn about their reasons for their retreat from society, and whether interactions with artistic subcultures helped motivate them to once again emerge from their homes.  New York Times Magazine reporter Maggie Jones talked with one hikikomori who inspires me to pursue this hypothesis: "'Don't laugh, but musicians really helped me, especially Radiohead,' he told me through an interpreter...'That's what encouraged me to leave my room.'"</p>
<p>	I hope to examine whether this perceived apathy can be described, admittedly dramatically, as "domesticated madness."  That is, whether apathy is a universal syndrome of youth or an irrational method of taming anger, frustration or feelings of alienation with mass culture.  Is it possible apathy could be an "adjustment disorder" to the culture shock when one internalizes hegemonic prejudices â€“ denying one's own sense of autonomy because society as a whole undervalues certain groups because of race, gender, or age?  Do youth who participate in artistic protest of mass culture experience a sense of control over their surroundings that inactive youth are missing?  Through the study of the prevalent pressures and resulting youth angst in these diverse settings, I will work to pinpoint the root of activism â€“ and apathy â€“ amongst youth newly awakened to societal inequity.  I hope to create a thesis to address the reasons youth are driven to rebel despite diverse circumstances, and how the arts can help them find their voices.</p>
