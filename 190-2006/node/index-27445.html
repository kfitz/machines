    <div class="content"><p>...when your courses overlap?  Today in my 19th Century U.S. Women Writers course we spent a chunk of time discussing the "role of the author" in a text.  This was actually kind of shocking because, I'll admit, I found myself questioning the importance of last week's discussion (is that bad?).  The class consensus seemed to be that the author could <em>not</em> be separated from the text, but likewise that the reader should not rely solely on the author's background/purpose to understand a text- one of those happy, indecisive "middle-ground" things.  Nothing new here, right?</p>
<p>The conversation became more interesting when we accepted that the author and the text were, to a degree, inseparable, and focused on the implications of this connection, such as the effect the gender of the author has on a text.</p>

I'm just wondering why the sites where we get our online readings for class change every semester.  First everyone used eRes and WebCT... then last year it was Moodle... and now it's Sakai.  Why hasn't Pomona just made one site for online readings and stuck with it?  I guess the advantage of Sakai over Moodle is that students from all the Claremont Colleges can access it... but Moodle could have just been updated to allow for this.

    <div class="content"><p>Reading msblogger's post got me thinking again about the Barthes essay, especially the part about ideas/texts not really being unique because everything is so socially constructed. Last semester for another class I read Paul D. Miller/AKA DJ Spooky's book "Rhythm Science" and it deals with a lot of similar themes in a new way. For Miller, everyone has to the potential to be a DJ of sorts, a role he links to the griot (a highly revered storyteller) in West African societies. You take aspects from culture, from the social constructions around us, and you sample and remix them to make them into something new that's relevant for you.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The beginning of Marchessault's article alludes to the question, if Shakespeare had a brilliant sister would she have been marginalized, would she have been placed so far out of the context of expression, that from her own hand no similar art would have arose?  Yet, when one looks at the language of Shakespeare's time it seems, in terms of communicating to the heart of human emotion and spirit we have not moved all that far.   This makes one realize the severity of the battle female authors have fought in such a short period of time to find a space in the literary world, when their expression has been viewed as the other. Is language then read, judged and conceptualized in a phallic space as the reading suggests because it was the norm.  A norm in which female authors had to enter into?  If this is true then the fact that a piece of work was written by a female is an essential part of the piece.  However, Barthes would say that this is part of biography and isn't essential to the author as subject.  The suggestion of female authors being tied to a feminist, autobiographic and reflective tone, seems to makes this context very important for the reader to receive.  While the reader is still taking their own decoding out of the material that they are reading, the whole concept of female authorship seems to change.  If the female author is dead, or non-present , why is there a reason to discuss her as the marginalized other?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I agree completely with msblogger, who says, "I do believe it is important to acknowledge that there is never a single author of a work (society, surroundings, family, etc. all influence an author)."  If Barthes is saying that an author pens nothing that has not been taught to him by his external surroundings, I could not agree more.  Still, his thesis can't accurately be labeled "the death of the author," since it seems the author never really existed with this train of thought.  Also, if no person exists outside her influences, why distinguish between the author and the scriptor (if we are equal to the sum our influences, and so is our writing)?  I don't see why Barthes should mix his philosophy and the everyday functionality of conventions, acting as if we should rebel against the ever-evil "Author's empire": "The author still reigns in manuals of literary history, in biographies of writers, magazine interviews, and in the very consciousness of litterateurs eager to unite--their person and their work; the image of literature to be found in contemporary culture is tyrannically centered on the author--" (50).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>"...the birth of the reader must be requited by the death of the Author" (Barthes 55). I believe that Barthes is being way too naive here with this statement. The truth death of an author figuratively speaking is when they are censored and literally speaking when they are put to death for what they write. When an author is censored, they die for their authorship which exists and is created for the sake of their readership in the hopes and dreams that what the author writes can plant seeds of new ideas and truths for the readership. It is a delicate and a beautiful relationship that has endured history and which has allowed for the creation of countless books.  To say that "the birth of the reader must be requited by the death of the Author" is denying the menacingly reality of censorship and punishment by governing bodies who will do what it takes to control what the reader reads.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I am just going to go ahead and make some general observations on the readings. I have no idea whether or not these observations have already been made because like most of you, this week has not been the best week for me to begin the ever-so daunting task of blogging. Thus I shall make my first true blog only three hours before class with hopes that next week I will be blogging with a little more punctuality.  Anyway, my thoughts on the readings were varied.  I found the articles to be somewhat scattered at times but there were some very valid and interesting points made throughout.<br />
	One point that I found particularly interesting to me in the Foucault article was when he interrogated the term "work."  He writes, "What in short, is the strange unit designated by the term, work? What is necessary to its composition, if work is not something written by a person called an "author?"  He continues to propose the question, "If an individual is not an author, what are we to make of those things he has written or said--?"  This really got me thinking.  Knowing next to nothing about art, a similar question has often crossed my mind.  Once someone is considered to be an artist, is everything he or she creates from then on considered art as well?  Where are we to draw the line?  Just as Foucault says, "Assuming that we are dealing with an author, is everything he wrote and said, everything he left behind, to be included in his work?"  It is a very interesting question and one that I feel is deeply intertwined with the question of authorship and what exactly it means to be an author.</p>
