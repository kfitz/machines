    <div class="content"><p>In her article "What Was an Author?" Molly Nesbit spends considerable time discussing the mixing of culture and industry. I personally find this combination to be perplexing. Is it ultimately beneficial for traditional art or not? I think the main point of art is expression, and as long as that is maintained, industry-infused art does not undermine traditional art, but extends it. In Lyotard's Xerox exhibition, visitors made photocopies, but each copy was unique due to the machine's inexactitude (254). To me, this is art when viewed as such; the personal expression of the art is in the discourse surrounding it. By early French law, cultural work was defined by "the material used and the imprint of the author's personality which would follow from working in this material" (234). As I just said, the Xerox example does show personality via individual interpretation. I think the tricky part comes with pinpointing the material. Is it the Xerox copy or perhaps the verbalized ideas inspired by the copy? I would argue for the latter. Without the discourse, the industrial machine's product does not reflect any human personality. Can industry and culture be happily wedded? Yes, as long as industrial technology does not force culture to deny a fundamental part of itself, personal expression.</p>

As I would rather not spend all of my time copy/pasting into Word to check my spelling, I hope that you all will agree that a few mispelled words do not discredit someone's overarching arguments, and that you will not waste any of our time by commenting on my blog to inform me that I have mispelled something.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm really behind this week. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of work that's carrying over from the summer that I'm still trying to finish up, on top of new senior responsibilities I never guessed existed, plus current jobs, plus adjusting to classes. Still hammering out the schedule.<br />
Excuses, excuses...<br />
I still haven't worked out how to get into Sakia to get the readings. I know I should have gotten on this before, but I've had so much else going on that somehow it just didn't happen, the way those things do. Can anyone give me any suggestions on getting into Sakia? I tried my Network login. I tired this login. No such luck. I've emailed IT but I don't expect a reply until it's too late because isn't that IT for you?</p>

    <span class="taxonomy"></span>
    <div class="content"><p>So part of me really identifies with what Barthes is saying: how many times, in an English class, has some gracefully beautiful and nebulous passage or work been deduced down to its small awkward parts, or explained away by something like, "This was written when Anne Sexton was having her 5th breakdown and she really liked cats then, so obviously this poem is about a cat."  </p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>But as someone who writes things, part of me still wants that kind of authorship recognition that Barthes suggests doing away with.  What's the point of writing if there's no one who's going to read it?  I think this is the problem, though.</p>

      <span class="submitted">Submitted by oneoutofseven on 5 September 2006 - 6:31pm.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"></span>
    <div class="content"><p>For an English class last week, we read Eliot's Tradition and the Individual Talent, a sort of treatise on how Eliot views the role of the poet.  In his essay, Eliot urges the poet to consciously place himself in the context of all English literary history-- applied universally, such as Eliot requests, when a poet is writing slam poetry, he needs also to be thinking about Chaucer &amp; the implications of his work on Hawthorne and what all of this means for new slam poem.  </p>
<p>Obviously I am taking this somewhat out of context (if Eliot could have predicted the emergence of slam poetry he might have given up before ever having written this essay), but I think Eliot's point is obsurd.  Sure, some poetry (such as Eliot's) makes references to every literary work in the history of mankind and there exists a sort of person who gets a good deal of pleasure from knowing the nature of those allusions.  I don't know, though, if that can be said to be the only poetry of value, in fact it seems absurd to even be arguing the point.  Isn't a new literary work the manifestation of everything which has ever been written before it simply by existing in the first place anyway?  Hasn't all published literary work changed, in some part, what "literature" is, what the word means, how it is perceived?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I applaud the blogging pioneers on here.  Your authorship has provided me with some guiding light to this quite foreign concept to me of academic blogging.  This is how I have always thought of blogging:</p>
<p>Current mood :)  Current music: Beach Boys</p>
<p>As the title alludes to, I wrote this entry in word first.  Here are my thoughts on why that is.  As soon as you display something you write in front of peers, or simply an audience larger than just your professor, authorship takes on a whole new meaning.  For me, I am uncomfortable and unconfident in this medium.  There is an uncertainty that comes with the exposure of my thoughts to other people.  Yet this is what authorship is.  The creations of our minds should be meant for open examination by others. I however, haven't gotten used to sharing yet, other than of course in live discussion type forums.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Overall, I had a mixed reaction to the Barthes reading. In terms of the tendency to exalt "the Author" and seek out a direct correlation between the life and experiences of the author and the text, I agree with him in that this is problematic. As he states on page 50, "explanation of the work is still sought in the person of its producer, as if, through the more or less transparent allegory of fiction, it was always, ultimately, the voice of one and the same person, the author, which was transmitting his 'confidences'." I don't write fiction, but I do write music and I have definitely experienced people reading way too much into my songs, trying to analyze me probably even more than my work. The link between a text and its creator is much more complex than this. And here's where Barthes and I start to diverge, because I think that this link  - although it's not the be all and end all in literary analysis -  exists. And that it matters.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I don't know if we're really allowed to use these blogs for this, but it says "thoughts about the course (discussions)" on the syllabus, so I suppose I'll give it a try and hope that I don't get shot down.</p>
<p>I admit that I am kind of apprehensive about this whole blog thing. It's not that I've never had to post reading responses before, it's just that I've never had to post so often about such a vague assortment of things (since it's not supposed to be solely about our readings, am I right?), and while I understand that this is meant to foster discussion in the absence of the real discussion we would be having if our class met more than once a week, I have to admit that I'm afraid that this is just not going to happen.</p>
