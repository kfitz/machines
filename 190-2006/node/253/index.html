    <div class="content"><p>I'm trying to figure out how to make my thesis topic narrower, so I thought I'd post my proposal to see if any has any suggestions, etc... I'm thinking about maybe just focusing on women. But perhaps as I dig deeper into the online communities I want to study, what I want to focus on will become clearer to me. Anyway, here's the proposal:</p>
<p>As postmodernism has influenced art and culture, it has also influenced the way we construct our identities. Under a postmodern model, conceptions of identity become more fluid, fractured, and wrought with a multiplicity of sources and meanings. Although postmodernism has been critiqued within the black community for its potential to deny the reality of lived experiences, I think that in this historical moment, postmodernism is crucial to expanding notions of blackness and black identity. The mainstream ideals of "authentic blackness" arise from social movements of the 1960s and often operate within the framework of a single-issue identity politics. Though these ideals were effective in achieving social, economic, and cultural gains for black people, they also "effectively hold the black community in stasis because they are not in sync with the fractures and fissuresâ€¦ that frame the contemporary black experience" (Neal 6).</p>
<p>Postmodernism has the potential to help to create conceptions of black identity that are more open, and that take into account the reality of diversity in the black community. One such framework for addressing blackness in terms of postmodernism is "newblack". "Newblackness" is defined as a contemporary moment in blackness which "embodies a radical fluidity within the spheres of blackness that allow for powerful conceptualizations across black genders, sexualities, ethnicities... socioeconomic positions, and socially constructed performances of 'black' identity"(Neal 122). One such newblack identity would be that of the black rocker, whose affiliation with "white" music subcultures often leads to them being read as not "authentically black" by their own communities. </p>
<p>My thesis will concern black rockers, postmodern black identities, and virtual communities. Although rock is a genre that was originated by black artists, most contemporary rock scenes are dominated by whites. Because of this white dominance of the subculture, rock is typically seen as a "white thing" by both white rockers and by the black community. In this sense, genre is used as a gatekeeping tool to police cultural borders, both to keep certain people in and others out of a particular subculture. For black rockers, this results in a profound sense of cultural and social displacement, because their identities exist in the fracture between these two communities. Also, the wide geographical spread between black rockers can lead to feelings of isolation, alienation, of being "the only one". </p>
<p>Through positioning black rockers under a "newblack" identity framework, I'll look at the specifics of this identity. A key component will be the displacement and invisibility one experiences both in the black community and in the predominately white music scene/subculture. I will then explore online communities made by and for black rockers (i.e. Afropunk.com), and address the ways in which the internet might help to create a kind of counterpublic sphere with the potential to:<br />
i. Provide visibility to an invisible community within a subculture<br />
ii. Lessen the isolation and displacement experienced<br />
iii. Create a space for the development of newblack identities and a rethinking/interrogation of blackness<br />
My first question is, under these conditions, how then do black rockers construct their identities? Following the model Jose Esteban Munoz' posits in his book Disidentifications,, there are three basic modes of identification:<br />
i. Assimilation<br />
ii. Counteridentification<br />
iii. Disidentification<br />
Assimilation occurs when the minoritarian subject attempts to become a part of the dominant culture and adhere completely to its norms and values. Counteridentification is the inverse of this, where the subject rejects the dominant culture and creates and oppositional identity. This is common within mainstream conceptions of blackness, wherein "black" is positioned in total opposition to "white".  The problem with both assimilation and counteridentification is that neither one truly interrogates the dominant culture. Assimilation is too preoccupied with fitting in, while counteridentification's fixation on opposition creates identities that are severely limited because they are predicated on what the dominant culture is not. </p>
<p>While various combinations of these may be taking place, I believe that disidentification will be the most relevant for people who frequent black rock communities online. As Munoz states, "to disidentify is to read oneself and one's own life narrative in a moment, object, or subject that is not culturally coded to 'connect' with the disidentifying subject." (12). Rock music (and its various scenes and subcultures), have been coded with both a white, heterosexual male producer and consumer in mind. What does it mean for a black person (who may also be female or queer or any number of other identities) to identify with this culture? As opposed to identification or counteridentification, disidentification represents the possibility of</p>
<p>"recycling and rethinking encoded meaning. The process of disidentification scrambles and reconstructs the encoded message of a cultural text in a fashion that both exposes the encoded message's universalizing and exclusionary machinations and recircuits its workings to account for, include, and empower minority identities and identifications. Thus, disidentification is a step further than cracking open the code of the majority; it proceeds to use this code as raw material for representing a disempowered politics or positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by the dominant culture" (Munoz 31).</p>
<p>	Aside from looking at how black rockers shape their identities, I'll also look at the effects that new media (specifically virtual communities) have on the formation of identities and communities. Studies have found that "online participation has the capacity to deepen linkages among those having similar beliefs as well as to serve as a virtual community that cuts across at least some traditional social divisions" (Norris 40). In the case of black rockers (who are spread out geographically and often experience feelings of isolation in mostly white scenes), the internet can serve as an important way to forge connections that were previously difficult or even impossible. </p>
<p>While the internet offers many possibilities, it is also important to look at its limitations. One current critique of the internet is that it is becoming more and more corporate, with private companies producing content and internet users being passive consumers. However, it is important to note that most of the communities I'll be researching are both the producers and the consumers of their virtual worlds. The notion of the digital divide will also be important in any study dealing with race and new technology. Discourses surrounding the digital divide tend to focus on the technological haves and have-nots. However, black rockers tend to come from a suburban or middle-class backgrounds, so it may be more interesting in this case to look at the digital divide in terms of the way that people use the internet. For example, people of color are more likely to use the internet "as a source of expressive or popular culture" (Nakamura 75). </p>
<p>Though I am not completely certain what my methodology will be, I do have some basic ideas. I will be extensively reading forums on online communities and observing what different sections are offered, what issues are discussed, and how people interact with each other through their posts. I would also like to interview some members of the community to get a feel for its basic demographics (i.e. class, gender, location). Another key point of examination will be the roles of women and queers in these virtual communities, since most discourse on black people in rock focus on heterosexual men. </p>
<p>	Although rock 'n' roll originated as black music, black people are now largely missing from discourses surrounding the genre and its respective subcultures. Despite the fact that black rockers tend to be invisible in this sense, there are a number of black people active in various rock scenes as musicians, producers, and as fans. Because of their unique position in the fracture between cultures, black rocker identities and communities serve as a compelling place to approach postmodernism and black identity. By examining notions of "newblackness," disidentification, and the media-embededness of our culture, my thesis will address the ways in which black rockers construct identities and communities, and how these are mediated/influenced by the internet. By controlling both the production of their communites and their uses, virtual communities of black rockers have the potential to create a counterpublic sphere to mainstream discourses on both rock and race.</p>
