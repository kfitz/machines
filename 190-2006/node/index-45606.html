    <div class="content"><p>with all the stuff we've been reading about piracy, downloads, p2p, this made me start thinking about my own music consumption habits. when I was younger, i was obsessed with collecting cds, for any birthday or christmas present I would ask people for CDs. Though I downloaded music, and would burn CDs from my friends or from the local public library (surprisingly good collection), I still ended up spending lots of money on buying CDs. I guess it was because when I was burning from others, that limited who I could listen to to artists other people had (Whom may not be the ones I'm interested in). With downloading, it was easiest to download who was the most popular. More obscure bands were difficult to find. Also, it may have been easy to download a few songs, but it was harder to find complete album using different P2P software. possible, but it took work. I also had some sort of code of ethics in what I would download or burn. For example, there were certain artists who I absolutely had to buy their album and not just have a burned copy. Movie soundtracks and other compilations I burned with no hesitance, because since they weren't albums and put together cohesively for artistic purposes</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was just thinking today about the tripod.com Nirvana website I made when I was in 7th grade and decided to set out to look for it.  When I found it I was startled-- when was I in 7th grade, 1998?  And its still around?  I explored a little bit-- of course I had no webspace of my own back then, so all of the linked photographs were gone, but a lot of the content still remained: guitar tabs for all of Nirvana's albums are still up, as are the lyrics for a couple of them, and the text from Kurt's suicide note.  The most interesting thing I re-discovered was the guestbook.  The latest entry was from July of 2006-- WHAT??</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While visiting my usual online haunts I found a blog to blog about!  Virginia Heffernan's "Screens" blog discovered a new use of YouTube!  And to think we had exhausted YouTube's potential--</p>
<p>Heffernan reports on a YouTuber who found a way to make money: homemade advertisements for big corporations!  The goal was to finance two months rent in San Francisco by scamming The Man.  The unnamed YouTuber picked up a vintage Nike t-shirt, gave it to a friend to wear at a David Rodigan concert (D.J. RamJam), and film the whole thing.  Next, he sent a letter to Nike explaining the project, and when the video received 15,000 hits, the user received a check for $1,815.88 from Nike.  As Heffernan points out, the video didn't attract viewers because it was an advertisement for Nike (at least not initially), it attracted viewers because of the DJ.  After watching the video, it's pretty hard to miss the glaring Nike symbol in the background.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>On the topic of children's media, I still have never really had a good discussion on why there are no mothers in Disney movies and why the mother figures that do exist in these movies either die or are actually completely evil as in Snow White and Cinderella. When I think about it, I'm pretty sure the only kind, loving mother that does not get killed off before the end of the first half of a Disney movie is the dog in 101 Dalmatians, but hey, she's a bitch so that really isn't much better-- :). This phenomenon is pretty weird when you think about it. The likelihood that ALL the mothers would not exist or only exist in a negative capacity solely by coincidence seems very slim.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>other people have touched upon this in Vaidhyanathan's work, but one of the things he talks about that i find really interesting is how people are taking films and creating their own edits and interpretations, like the Phantom Edit, or Puchkov's goblin dubs. What I liked about this was the idea that usually when people think about art, but particularly with film since production is such a process, what people view is often seen as a finished product. With what these folks are doing, they're asserting that art is never finished, and can always be reinterpreted, retinkered with, etc. </p>
<p>One theme we've talked about in class while discussing authorship, is one does the role of intention play. Does it matter what the author intends at all? As Vaidhyanathan writes, "an author cannot control how a character, idea or plot will be read, refasioned, or criticized".</p>

At first I was perturbed, because because this most recent thought was my 12th in the day. I rarely have more than a dozen thoughts on any given day, and never on a Friday. But, I had it nonetheless, so I decided to hear myself out. My thought was about this recent battle between HD DVDs and Blue-Ray DVDs. In the next year or two, one of them will most likely win out as the "better technology." This is necessary, because the next generation of players will need to pick which format it would most like to "shake hands" with.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While listening to Metallica, I had a thought. As is often the case when I am listening to Metallica, I was catching up on my world affairs. By this I mean that I was buried in a Newsweek, able to escape only for second at a time to check people's away messages.<br />
As I was reading, I came across two articles on the Michael Richards incident, which is being referred to in the media concisely as "the rant." Anyways, I had already posted in the blog about this rant right after it happened and I was, as was much of right-thinking America, very critical of the guy who plays Kramer.<br />
Anyways, one of the articles was about Michael Richards' recent 'apology tour' as it is being called by many. The article was not just about his apology, but about the utter slough of celebrity apologies for various deplorable shit that they've done lately. From Senator Foley to Mel Gibson, to Kramer himself, celebrity apologies are everywhere. However, in Kramer's case, his offense was caught on camera, which sucks for him. Anyways, the article, which I won't try to summarize made the point that it isn't a positive thing that Richards said these things, but it is a positive thing that there has been such a public outcry, and he feels the need to go on an apology tour.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've always felt that the US war on drugs was grievous waste of time and money. Furthermore, I deplore the way in which we've exported our Puritanical beliefes and policy (as well as our hypocritical glorification of parts of drug culture) on the matter to the rest of the world. Anyone who hasn't seen the documentary <em>Grass</em> absolutely should, it's really interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101654.html?nav=rss_email/components"> Anyway, here's an interstesting article on US involvement in Afghan opium production</a></p>
<p>Turns out this has been a record year. Afghanistan produces a vast amount of the world's opium and therefore is responsible for the majority of the heroine in circulation. Although it was one of the US's explicit goals to decrease opium production in Afghanistan, it would seem that it's been expanding rapidly. While certian goverment officials would like to blame this on the Taliban, it seems that unseating the Taliban directly contributed to the increase. Where opium production was outlawed under the Taliban governement, and the ban was fairly well enforced (mind you I don't support the Taliban, I'm just saying that  it's clear that they aren't responsible for the opuim production) the production has nearly doubled since Hamad Karzai took office. Furthermore, nearly a third of the country's GDP is dependent on opium production and large scale destruction of the crops could result in severe destabilization for the already troubled country.</p>
<p>It's a really intersting article. You should read it.</p>
