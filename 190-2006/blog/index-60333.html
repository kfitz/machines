    <div class="content"><p>I'm was listening to Led Zeppelin and the song Ramble On came on. This made me want to blog. I'm gonna go ahead and blog about a class session we had a few weeks ago. It was the class where we were verbally presenting our theses. For people who weren't there, I will briefly recap. I was introducing my thesis, which is about "white trash." I put that in air quotes for reasons I will explain later.<br />
When I started my explanation, I was using the term "white trash" completely indiscriminately. Not that I was using the term with derision towards anybody, but I just thought that it was a term that was generally accepted in our society, and although I know it is an insult, it was never really used seriously where I am from.</p>

YouTube is throwing cash to Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group in order to avoid a lawsuit, and MySpace has some deal with Snocap I'm sure could be better described by our class MySpace expert (sorry I'm bad with names, no sarcasm intended).  As we've seen with the South Park videos, YouTube is working on technology to keep users from posting copyrighted material.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don't know what happened in between that rebellious young sprite and this washed up college student struggling to finish six blogs before I leave this desk.  I was going somewhere with this, but I forget where.  So in lieu of that I think this would be a good time and place to do a quarter-life assessment. </p>
<p>I sit in front of three parking tickets, from various times in the past few weeks when I've lost or otherwise neglected my car.  I found my bike last night while skateboarding because I thought my bike had been stolen.  I left it on the bike rack outside our class last wednesday.  In fifth grade I thought I had been shot but really a kid had just thrown an egg at my head.  I did accidentally stick a tack in my temple last year however.  I also thought kiddie porn was "kitty porn" until last year.  A documentary I was making for an independent study is due tomorrow but both Pitzer's and my harddrive are out of space so I'm not sure what to do.  Mario, I copped your suicide idea for my final media sketchbook film.  Lindsay, the music you asked about from our prank-remake video is DJ Schmolli "satan.omen.death," chosen by Mario.  And Clay, I feel like I'm leaving you out of this list of people who won't read this, did you know Lawless brought your Bush bombing video up at the trial?  I can't remember why, but oh, did she bring it up.  And I'm forgetting Professor Fitzpatrick: I'm sorry I haven't responded to your email, as you can see I've been busy blogging but I will get to it asap.</p>

    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://globalo.blogspot.com/">a blog i bet you all will appreciate</a></p>
<p>i was reading all of these amazing last-minute homestretch blogs, which are pretty awesome in general (thanks for all the links, lindsay) and somehow my neighbor heard what i was up to and recommended me to check out that global o site, seeing as how i was getting such a kick out of the internet. i thought the home website (globalorgasm.org) was pretty kickass, but the fact that there was a BLOG link got me way too excited - and reminded me of these lurking blogs that i need to complete... ah enough of that.</p>
<p>as i was seeking inspiration for a blog topic (slash surfing the net), i stumbled across MORE information about this horny manatee business. these underground flash phenomena really blow my mind -- especially how the internet can help encourage and support likeminded people into action. but i can't help but wonder to what end? like this global orgasm thing for example, more power to the movement (and i hope you all participate, and continue to take me somewhat seriously as a person...) hopefully it will make a positive peaceful difference in the world - oh tangent here, but has anyone seen "a constant gardener"? i just watched it and it was amazing and everything, but the realities of corruption were still hard for me to handle. and this movie had such a social consciousness and was still critically acclaimed, i hope it opened up some minds at least... -- and yeah, back to media making a difference, i like where this is going so i posted it for you all - but at the same time i also think it's hilarious. same with the manatee stuff, i know it was born from a conan skit but i mean over a million hits in a few days? thats hella popular, right? and the same with postsecret.blogspot.com - all of these websites have caught my attention in that they are crazy popular for the simple basic concepts shown on the web. i still can't wrap my head around it - and more importantly to me, how this can be converted into real actual change.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>...the state of movie making these days, has anyone seen the trailer for the movie 300?</p>
<p>First of all, I'd just like to say that this movie looks like the most epic thing imaginable. The main  badass Spartan character is one of the most intimidating people I've ever seen. </p>
<p>But that's beside the point. The point is that the behind the scenes footage of this film looks like a tutorial video for green screening. In fact, it looks like, at no point in the filming of this movie did they ever step foot outside of a studio. Literally everything was green. This is what I was originally going to do my thesis on.</p>

<p>"John McCain's War On Blogs<br />
John McCain has made clear that he doesn't like the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Now he has introduced legislation that would treat blogs like Internet service providers and hold them responsible for all activity in the comments sections and user profiles. Some highlights of the legislation:</p>
<p>-- Commercial websites and personal blogs "would be required to report illegal images or videos posted by their users or pay fines of up to $300,000." </p>
<p>-- Internet service providers (ISPs) are already required to issue such reports, but under McCain's legislation, bloggers with comment sections may face "even stiffer penalties" than ISPs.</p>

<p>"In the space of two months, [the LA Times'] publisher and beloved editor were fired because they refused to submit to further budget cuts demanded by the corporate parent, Chicago-based Tribune Co."</p>
<p>The LA Times apparently had famous industry-leader editors who helped carve out a space for Los Angeles at the turn of the 20th century.  The paper was once hugely respected and popular, but between 1990 and today, the LA Times' circulation fell from 1.2 million to 800,000, largely because of online news websites.  LA is also such a broad and diverse region that one newspaper for the entire population is a difficult feat.  (My Creative Journalism professor this semester emphasized the growth of niche markets in journalism over the past three or four decades.)  The LA Times also has the pressure of covering Hollywood/entertainment stories, which aren't seen as serious work (by critics or reporters) while newspapers like the Washington Post get to focus on the government.  (I read this in the Wash. Post so it might be a little biased:)</p>

The "NBC 2.0" initiative is a program by NBC Universal to cut costs ($750 million) and 5% of its positions.  Because people watch news mostly as habit, news stations have little pressure to keep top personalities on the air or pay them more than others to come back.  </p>
<p>The article doesn't mention whether these changes are taking place because viewership is down, or management is just getting greedy:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>On March 30th of next year, the film industry in this country hits a major crossroads. On that day, which will be either a particularly happy one, or a devastatingly sad one for me personally, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hits theaters. It is on that day, that America will decide once and for all if technology is a benefit to the film industry. </p>
<p>In this new installment of the Teenage Mutant Ninja saga, the movie is entirely digitally animated. I'm sure it's going to look OK, but the characters themselves are almost like superheroes in the way they move. Just judging from the trailer, they are jumping impossible distances, leaping from rooftop to rooftop and jumping from a building to the the street. I just think that the TMNT live action movies were unbeatable.</p>
