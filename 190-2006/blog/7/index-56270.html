    <div class="content"><p>So I think I really don't do this much in the blogspace, but I feel like ranting today. Maybe it's this meeting that i have today to try and convince Dean Clark to let me graduate a semester early (something I think should be a no brainer as long as all my credits/requirement/thesis are done). Maybe it's finals time or my trip to Vegas. Whatever, this little blurb of an editorial about a fairly trivial thing just set me off.</p>
<p>They're putting TVs in the LA transportation buses. Sounds fun, huh? like JetBlue TVs on transcontinental flights so you can watch crappy movies you wouldn't have payed to see otherwise but will secretly enjoy. But these ones will be on the entire time over speakers that will probably emit sound between volume levels of loud and ear-splitting. Plus, commercials.. lots of them. And targeted at the specific "bus riding demographic" (i.e. poor people without cars). I don't know about anyone else, but I actually love riding buses - it's a time to zen out on the slowly moving cityscape, or delve into a book, or people watch - but for the most part it is a silent activity (other than eavesdropping on close conversations and the occasional alcoholic/drug induced outburst). It's kind of like swimming or something - tune out if you want to. But now books and conversations and even outbursts will have to contend with bad credit advertisements and worthlessly summarized news broadcasts.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So in lieu of doing anything productive on a Sunday night (they're sacred, right?), I watched America's Next Top Model. I obviously wasn't expecting anything substantial, culturally aware, or even entertaining - just something to kill time. But it's deliberate avoidance of any of these ideas was incredible. </p>
<p>In just one episode, a girl admitted to having attempted suicide, and a Spanish guy told one of the models that he "didn't like black girls." Meanwhile we are supposed to be focused on the trials of the competition: "Nobody thinks I want this bad enough," "I don't feel pretty enough," "No one thinks models feel." The suicide attempt confession was blurted out during one of the "challenges" and after the shocked reaction shots, no one bothered ot mention it again. Except for saying that she was really brave and strong, it was a non-issue or even plotline in the show. She won the challenge for being so strong and brave.. and cut to her on One Tree Hill as a guest star. Whoo - suicide attempts make you a strong person with more emotion to tap into when you're acting.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Simultaneously one of the funniest and more important articles that I have read in a while: Business week's "Hip Hop two-step over product placement." First off, it includes a photo of one the whiter shade of pale kind of middle-aged man who freely admits to knowing little to nothing about hip hop music, saying he's more of a "Van Morrison/Eric Clapton kind of guy." But the article includes snipets of an interview with Russell Simmons, hip hop impressario extraordinaire, who is talking about a deal with McDonalds to pay hip hop and rap artists for including things like "Big Mac" in their lyrics. but he says the deal might not work unless listeners are unaware of said agreement. In other words, Micky D's is uninterested in publicity that is not sneaky and underhanded. Simmons had the idea to instead produce songs in which rappers would rap about how mcdonald's wants to throw money at them to reposition their brand and thus create a criticism of the exploitation of hip hop culture and also corruption in adversiting. But then wasn't it simmons that brokered the deal for P. Diddy to pen "Pass the Courvosier" to reposition that brand? The whole thing seems pretty tricky to me. I may just be naive and optimistic, but I usually figure even commercial artist aren't always just plugging a product. I'm not saying creative advertising has no place, I just think it would be too bad if art was reduced to a series of commercials. As David Kiley characterizes hip hop, I just want it to return to "a lot of lyrics about bling and money."</p>

I've always held some sort of contempt for all those super personal bloggers that just talk about how they're feeling from day to day ("my cat is sick :( and shelly called me a fat whore and boo hoo"), but I was just overcome by that impulse to vent and send it into cyberspace. And what better to rant about than that sleeping ominous giant of an anxiety-inducing undertaking. the senior project. Here's the problem, I found an idea that I like... which makes starting it that much harder. My previous thesis topics would be fairly easy to start and finish by comparison.</p>

I would call it an inquisitive mind, but I think its more due to compulsion than curiosity. I'm like a contextual information alcoholic/smoker/insert addiction here. Especially when it comes to artists/actors/musicians/writers, basically producers of culture/art. So I've just fallen for a new musician, Richard Swift, and I just went to do a bio check, and can't seem to get a straight answer. At least not like I'm used to. Generally, you go to an artists homepage and get birthplace, education, "formative life events," marital status, kids, blah, blah, blah.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Most days reading the Business section of the newspaper is just boring, very rarely it is extremely rewarding. Today was one of those days.<br />
Resorts have begun to market procreation vacations that allow couples to "relax and conceive." These vacation packages come with everything from magic fertility elixers to Barry White CDs, heart print boxers to sex doctors. Will sex doctors become the new tennis pros to help you work on your swing during vacation? Have we come to the point that we need to go to a vacation/seminar to learn how to make babies? So many questions are raised by such a stimulating and newsworthy article.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I found a new website today that forced me, without even thinking twice, to surrender name, email, birthdate to livejournal so I could have an account. The site is fuzzysquid.com/LJ.com, which posts the latest forty images that have been posted on the live journal blog - so its a great mishmash and random assortment of posts that make you curious enough to actually look at the blogs. Things that you never would have looked up if they hadn't come up randomly. And live journal itself is really kind of a cool forum that I'd never checked out. It's fascinating to me to see the way that people explicitly "author" identities for themselves - whether their profile is entirely fictitious or just a desired projection of their self.</p>

Tipped off by an article in the LA Times, I went looking for muppets videos... and I have to say, I've become an instant youtube fan. It's such a neat space for people to post both original and very very unoriginal work. It's such an interesting mix of funny news clips, overly personal video diaries ranging from funny to scary to boring, and a few diamonds in the rough - like these re-thinkings of sesame street characters. I'm not claiming that they are brilliant works of art, and they contain no original content.</p>

No matter how I tried to stay focused on the main points of the introduciton to Hamlet on the Holodeck, like  the actual assertions about the computer as  medium, I kept coming back to this obliquely related quote. It's so obvious, but I've never thought of it in such simple terms. The best writing usually comes out of an almost urgent need to communicate something.<br />
 I guess it really drew me in because the statement just seems so pertinent  and in  way mocking at this juncture in the thesis writing process.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When we have discussed filmmakers and directors as authors, we've mostly talked about the role of cinematographers or writers or producers, but somehow avoided discussing the role of actors in the authorship of a film. True, they are mostly pretty, vapid, blank slates for the director to carve into his vision. Paul Walker- definitely not an author. But in some cases, they have a huge impact on the text. I was reading an old article I clipped out of the LA Times about Andrew Bujalski's new film "Mutual Appreciation." I had pulled it because of one quote about his characters, where he said that they "get reconsidered retroactively through the prism of whoever I asked to play them." We forget that actors often rewrite their characters, and certainly they at least "write" the character with their own specific mannersims and what they bring to the role.</p>
