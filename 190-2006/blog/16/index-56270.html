    <div class="content"><p>I was resistant against Facebook at first, I still am slightly, but I am getting over it.  I feel like social networking is there for you to engage with it at any level.  That is what is great about it.  Either you can turn it into a major source of communication, one that you rely on for social interaction (of some form) ,or you can just put up a profile and check it once every two months when really you just want to stalk someone.<br />
I did however witness an instance this week in which I saw proof of the benefits of social networking in terms of making ones academic life easier through quick and easy access to friends.  I am in a research methods class for Psychology and we have to conduct these surveys. It is really about all we do in that class.  So I put my big'ol survey together and was like, "cool, now I just have to go give it out".  Right yeah, that took forever, I was sweating by the end of my three hour jaunt to get like 50 survey's filled out.  So anyways, I talk with my friend Sean, and he says, "oh I just put my survey on line and sent out an invite on facebook".  He had around100 responses after just two hours of it being up.  Imagine that, life made easy by a computer.  I think that something like that shows the benefits of having social networks like facebook.  By just sending the survey out to all of his networked friends he was both being less invasive than I was going door to door and getting more responses.  I can see how this type of access could be helpful on many academic and professional levels.  So perhaps while facebook might be hindering some scantily clad drunkard users from getting jobs, I think it has the potential to be helpful in many other respects.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The Manovich article starts out talking about the work space which Razorfish embodies. He says of the office, "The design of the space functions as a metaphor for computer culture's themes; interactivity, lack of hierarchy, modularity." This made me think as I have always had an interest in design, especially that of a-typical work spaces.    Weird thing to have an interest in, I know, but I swear it is true.  It has caught my eye ever since I walked into the office of a financial planner which had been designed by one of the guys on Queer Eye for the Strait Guy.  This office was somewhat similar to the described Razorfish office.  The owner of this company explained to me that the space was about having intimacy in the work place when computers are driving us to a point of isolation.  Again in this office there was no semblance of a hierarchy and no closed doors.  Everything that was happening in this office was in plain view to all who entered the space.  Again this summer at my work I encountered another interesting design.  Again it was relitivly open, but did have offices along the walls.  Each of these offices however had glass walls so you could see everything going on within them.  At first I felt like I would never have a moment of privacy in the office.  This was true, other than the bathroom of course (which I might add was co-ed, something I never fully embraced).  Again it the space was about television.  The office was designed to give of a young hip, modern feel and leave space for communication to occur.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Has anyone else seen that commercial for what appears to be a leap frog type educational video game, in which the gray star wars looking monster puts down his weapon true Gandhi style.  It starts out with a kid playing a shoot-um up video game than the monster/freak turns around and is all, "I can't do this there are kids watching, I am out of here". Then it goes on to say make your kids play our educational skill building video games.  Yeah.  It is pretty pretty pretty funny.  It did make me think about how potentially successful educational video games can be.  Of course, there are the dry ones that no kid is really going to play when presented with other alternatives for spending their time, like eating green ketchup.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In light of the Borat movie release this weekend, I would like to discuss Ali G (Baron Cohen) and his other fun filled characters. Wine, I like.  I read this article where the author was trying to sound self-important because she had experienced a moment in which she was able to speak with Baron Cohen himself, (out of character).  Apparently this is rare.  The article talked about how he keeps up his character face in any interview even in light of the political issues that have been brought up surrounding the Borat movie. He still responds as Borat.<br />
      Another reporter in the article was making the argument that when reporters speak to him in character they are not fully doing their job, that of seeking information.  What they are doing is further promoting his act.  They are simply being another venue in which Borat is gaining popularity instead of getting at the real issues of who Baron Cohen is and why he is doing this.  We don't really ever get to know what he thinks about the fact that his Borat My Space page says he lives "three mile north of fence to jewtown". I think this is of course fitting because he is in the genre of comedy, the moment he makes commentary, it becomes a little to serious.  But it is true that they are never going to get a real answer out of him, from the point of view of what the artist thinks of his creation if he is always talking as the man from Kzakhstan.  Perhaps Barbara Walters could get a compelling interview out of him.  Make him squeeze out a few tears?! It could happen.  Or Opera?  She might be able to do it.  Here are some fun controversy facts I found on the Wik:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I feel like my thesis is becoming really one sided.  I am writing about children's television advertising, and I feel as if everything I read is simply saying, "in this way advertising is bad for kids".  This is all good and fine as this is a point that I am going to probably spend around a month arguing, but still at the same time I would like to suggest a future alternative that is a positive step forward from the current system.<br />
	Right now however, I am feeling like I have been hit by the negative train.  Over and over again, because many of the articles and books I have found are saying the same thing.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I used to play lots of Street Fighter Two, as I was a product of being raised with three brothers.  This was the only fighting game I would play. It was likely because I found satisfaction in playing the character of Chin- Lu (I believe that was her name).  Clearly, at the age of 10 I was unaware of the need for identification with a female in a fighting game, but it worked for me.  I would get into a fight with Ryu, and instead of punching him I would run around in circles imaging that he was her boyfriend and they were being forced to fight by some evil controller.<br />
	All fantacies aside for Ryu's fireballs, I wanted their to be an aspect of story in my game.  The only other game I ever got into was Final Fantacy Seven.  Again, this was because of the story behind it.  My brothers on the other hand would likely argue that they enjoyed the fighting aspect of it more.  I was the only one that would take the time to read every character blurb during the narrative parts.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When reading through First Person, I noticed that two of the authors provided conflicting analysis of the consumerism aspect of The Sims.  In "Video Games of the Oppressed", Frasca says, "The consumerist ideology that drives the simulation is nothing short of disturbing:  the amount of friends that you have literally depends on the number of goods that you own." I couldn't find the other quote, but it came later in the book with the author taking the stand that The Sims produces feelings of strong anti-consumerism.  Buying more things means working harder to get them. If you get your litl brat too many toys they may become spoiled.  If you buy a huge crib you have to pay for someone to take care of it ect.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In response to Ghostwriters blog about online television.  </p>
<p>This is specifically in reference to the NBC and ABC shows that are being broadcast online.  I have gone to these network websites for a little late night Grey's or Lost action.  I think it is great that they broadcast these and can see that this is the direction television seems to be heading. (last year when they first announced the broadcasts I was beyond stocked.)<br />
The other day I looked at this graph which predicted the growth of internet use for daily tasks such as shopping, television watching and so on.  It showed that this growth has been exponential for the last several years.  It is however predicted that within the next 10 years there will be a major surge.  This isn't surprising, it is actually very obvious but it was still an interesting graph to look at.  Everyday people are growing more comfortable with the internet, but we still get a skewed view of this trend because we are in a young tech-savvy college environment.  Once American citizens as a whole reach a point of comfort with the internet, use for every day activities is predicted to surge because of a snowball effect.  If you neighbor is using the internet to buy their groceries and it is turning out well for them, suddenly you may jump on board.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>A very random mixture of my current thoughts-- they are all somewhat media studies related.</p>
<p>Whenever I go to blog about something non-book of the week related, I always first think of celebrity gossip.  I sometimes read this sports writers column, The sports guy.  In order to get NFL game picks out of his wife he had to promise her an unedited paragraph on his column.  Guess what she writes about in his heavily read column, celebrity gossip.  Do you think that celebrity gossip is a gendered thing?  Here is a man writing his masculine sports column and his wife chipping in her feminine celebrity gossip.   It makes for an interesting juxtaposition.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was watching tv with my friend who is one of those obsessive channel changers.  I mean, this is borderline put this compulsive behavior into a book for diagnosis.  He changes the channels I would say on average, every 2 minutes.  So, I am sitting there trying to watch with him some Sports Center show, then some TBS movie, than a crappy MTV game show, then -- With every switch of the channel I get sucked into the next show. I want to see if the man can break the record for largest pizza dough ever tossed, but alas there is the click and we move on in television world.  </p>
<p>This is frustrating yes, but when one is in the middle of reading Understanding Comics it at least has the interesting aspect of being able to relate this to closure.  The television is like a world of its own where channels are constantly broadcasting giving the shows life.  If I am not watching a particular show however, I don't think about it's possibility as an existing form of entertainment for me.  When the channel gets changed and I don't get to learn if the bomb ever went off, it ceases to exist for me.  I can still perceive the whole though, because I am made aware of the fact that the show is going to come to some sort of a conclusion.  It is my experience with television that tells me something more must be there even when no longer focusing on the reality of the show.  So, this is what I was thinking about as my friend changed the channels.</p>
