    <div class="content"><p>When I read this quote "If who I am matters LESS, maybe what I SAY will matter MORE."  I thought, well I suppose this is why we are reading understanding comics in a authorship class.  The idea of identification through simplification and generalization makes sense, I had just never thought of it before.  It is interesting however, that this doesn't directly apply to other forms of representation.  </p>
<p>In a fictional book for example, we do not want the main character to be simplified to the point where we identify with them.  On the contrary we want explicit details in order to gain a better understanding of their complex inner workings.  I think we need this to make them real, so that we are no longer fully reading them as a character, but rather as a person. We find identity though other means, by their feelings emotions, actions est.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I wish there was more of a clear cut path as to what I am meant to do in applying for media type jobs.  All of my friends who are in the process of applying for consulting jobs have such an advantage in that the school caters to their needs.  If applying to a job I was interested in meant following a specific predetermined formulaic process I wouldn't have so much pent up anxiety about the fact that it is senior year and the impending graduation is approaching.<br />
I want to look for work in children's television and perhaps in advertising but it is just a little disheartening to be surrounded by friends who are perusing more predictable paths.  I.E. they know what they  want to do next year, could tell me their starting salary, and could predict an average day. A lot of my finance friends already have job offers and they had an internship last summer which showed them exactly what working for their company will be like.  I feel like my internship in television didn't really provide me with the best picture of what salaried work would be like.  It got me into the environment, but my tasks were very intern specific.  I am sitting here going well likely if I pursue children's television I will start out as a PA, get frustrated and disillusioned and wind up back in gradschool to pend the inevitable second attempt at trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.  Has anyone found a way of getting around this feeling of uncertainty as to how to proceed about media job searches.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I can't read this book at night.  Granted I am a bit of a wuss when it comes to anything remotely frightening.  I.E. I can't even handle watching the previews for The Grudge 2.  But-- You would think I could read this book at night, honestly.  Last night I tried really tried and I was so fully imagining the pressence in my dark room that I had to put the thing down.  But, I mean it isn't even really scary, creepy yes, psychologically challenging, but not really that scary hmmm.  </p>
<p>I just think it is interested that I feel like I have been so influenced by the tone of the book as set by "Johnny".  If it weren't for being told at the beginning of the book that I was going to be in for a mind tripping ride I don't think I would find the tone so daunting.  Really the naritive of the Navison Story isn't that unsettling.  A little strange, but if I didn't have Johnny intermitidly telling me how life altering it was I don't think I would be frightened.  It is amazing how this writing strategy works to completely alter the way I read both sets of narratives.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was talking to my friend today and she told me about a reality TV show she had heard of in England that was set up like the Bachelorette.  The twist was the girl these guys were dating used to be a man (unknown to the contestants).  I googled it and couldn't find this show, so I am not sure if this premise is entirely true.</p>
<p>This however made me think about the ethics of reality television.  If psychologists have to submit experimental designs to ethics committees to ensure minimal physical or psychological damage there is no reason reality TV shouldn't face these same restrictions.  Psychology is in the name of science but an experiment in which heavy amounts of psychological stress was induced by deception, would never fly.  In reality television I feel they push the boundaries, trying to find more ways to push there contestants in the name of entertainment.  In other countries for example Big Brother is a huge success, I have heard stories of people giving birth in the house, people going nearly crazy in the house, people being manipulated by the producers and forced (slightly) to do things they clearly don't want to do, est..  Yes, these people agree before hand to do whatever the producers throw at them, but there is a lot of pressure involved.</p>

Ok I don't actually have net flix-- but you get what I am saying, the next movies I should watch.  It is just always good to get suggestions from others. I find myself going to the movie store and saying "hmmmm" these days.  So anyone have any top 10's or anything like that???  I have a feeling this class could come up with quite the killer list.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don't think that just because the audience isn't provided with an actual theatre experience they aren't being provided with an alternate and valuable experience.  Yes there is something to be said about seeing Madame Butterfly in the Met, but there is also something to be said about seeing Madame Butterfly broadcast over the streets of New York.  If the purpose of this is to make the Theatre more accessible to the general public I don't see anything wrong with this form of broadcasting.  First there are many people who cannot afford to have an actual theatre experience, bringing the met performances to them may be the only way they are able to have view these shows.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Over the summer I worked for a children's television production company in England called Granada Kids.  We primarily produced television shows for ITV which is England's second major television network channel following the BBC.  The BBC is government funded while ITV is commercial.  While I was working at Granada the department was told it was to be shut down.  ITV was no longer making enough profit from children's television to sustain development and production of new shows.  They are going to continue making game shows because of the low budget nature, but all other children's television programming was going to be cancelled by next spring.  As far as public television goes this leaves the BBC with a monopoly on children's programming.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I saw this video on CNN today.  It is about a retired man Robert Fulghum from Kansas running a one man campaign "Oprah for President".  He has written a book by the same name and is currently under the gun of Oprah's lawyers, who are threatening to sue.   Fulghum even has a website dedicated to the campaign with complete with songs and messages urging supporters to write "Oprah for President" on dollar bills and put them into circulation.<br />
This made me think of an article I read the other day which stated that more people voted for American Idol than for the presidency in 2004.  Which in turn made me think about a new movie coming out.. The one where Robin Williams runs for presidency as a joke and then gets voted into office.</p>

<p>This all goes back to that question that many of us have faced before.  What is art?  If a two year old doodles on a piece of paper to show their mother is that art?  Or should art only be considered art as decided by the critical eye.<br />
I think that this question is ambiguous in the same way that the survey we took in class last week was.  Everyone is going to provide their own answer because everyone is going to relate to what they consider art in a different manner.  It is a subjective question and the answer for me is loaded with personal experience.</p>
