    <div class="content"><p>now i shall reflect on my time as a blogger here.</p>
<p>first off, to respond to ghostwriter's post. i originally wanted my name to be MoFoSnakes but when I signed up for the name, it totally slipped my mind (much to my dismay). Why I chose neurotica is that i feel really neurotic every minute of the day.</p>
<p>again, like many others, this blogging thing has grown on me. i'm interested in reading what other people say, and it's cool to write about something new I've found out, or something that's been on my mind lately. it was an interesting way to get to know the class. when we were presenting on our thesis topics, that's when i was able to associate the screen name to the actual person.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>granted, this was inspired by youtube. another reason why youtube has become an everyday part of my life is that it has enabled me to watch clips from the TV shows of my childhood, which i thought was lost to me forever. One such show is KIDS incorporated.</p>
<p>This show used to play on the Disney Channel right before the Micky Mouse Club. KIDS incorporated as spawned the careers of Fergie from Black Eyed Peas, Jennifer Love Hewitt and a guy from six feet under. The concept of the show is kind of weird. it's about these kids who have a band, kids incorporated. it just follows their lives, and throughout the show they do covers of songs that were popular at the time. though in theory they rewrote songs so they didn't seem scandalous, there's a clip when they're covering "physical" and it still seems raunchy.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>youtube has made the last week bearable and livable for me. it has definitely become a part of my repertoire of sites i always check when i go online (e-mail, facebook, myspace, wikipedia, nytimes, and now youtube). i think it's cool that it's sort of become like a reference source. for instance, if someone makes a crazy appearance on a tv show, youtube it. you can catch up on stuff in your own pace. </p>
<p>the newest thing i like about is how people in video classes are putting their stuff up (like some folks in this class). it's a cool space to show your work because on one hand there's the potential that lots of people can see it. on the otherhand, it's not an intimidating place because there are so many videos that range from being almost professional to just being home videos. i would feel less self conscious to post my stuff on youtube because i can comfortably fall within that huge range. also, there's the anonymous nature of it. in my video classes, i would always dread critiques (even though in the end i did enjoy them). they were nervewracking because i'm putting myself on the line, everyone knows me, my past work, and i'm seeing people as they watch my work, as they critique my stuff. on youtube, though similar dialogues can happen, there's a distance, that for me, makes it more comforting.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>yo. so i've been taking a screenwriting class, and it's the first creative writing class i've ever really taken, so it's the first time in college where i've been creaing my own work. though, like all of you, as the liberal arts college student i am, i've written volumes, none of this really seemed to be like my own work, cuz it's all based on researching something else, it's all done in a framework of a class, etc. </p>
<p>throughout the class, we're supposed to have written a feature length screenplay (80-120 pages). being in this class, while being in senior seminar at the same time has been interesting, since we've been examining deeply what it means to be an author, etc.  and now i'm trying it out. I just turned it in today and i'm thinking about the whole process.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Hey folks. Awhile ago there was a video that was banned on YouTube. It was the music video for the Staten-Island based MC, NY Oil, for his song "Y'all Should get lynched". The song and music video criticizes mainstream rappers who have "sold out". The video takes images of these artists, like 50 Cent, Foxy Brown,  (and later condoleezza rice) etc. and juxtapose them with old "coon" and sambo imagery, as well as photos of lynched black men. I was curious what other people thought of this.</p>
<p>Here's a link to view the video: http://www.unkut.com/2006/10/lynched-video-banned-by-youtube/. </p>
<p>I have mixed feelings myself. On one hand, I agree with what his criticisms are, however I'm not sure if I agree with how he goes about it. Lynching is a very powerfully violent image to provoke. Also, there's a section of the song where he talks about women, and how they're disrespecting themselves by shaking their asses. He has a line that says (to an extent cuz i'm doing it by memory) "with your tits popping out...bitch ass hos get pimped, not treated special", and then  that is followed by clips from a porn where a black woman is being raped by a white men. It felt like he was saying that women who choose to dress or act a certain way, deserve the assaultive treatment they get. in the end, he reproduces a lot of the misogynist and homophobic aspects of mainstream rap, though he challenges an essentialized notion of blackness, he does so by creating another.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>With much resistance at first, I have now succumbled fully to the ipod revolution. I was really put off my the advertisements at first. in the Bay Area, at some BART (Subway-like public transportation) stations, the platforms would be covered with IPOD ads. You couldn't go anywhere without seeing those  Even though there are definite faults (it's expensive, the battery-life is ridiculously not what they advertise, etc.), I love my ipod. it's just crazy to have so much of my music available at once. I used to carry my discman everywhere with me, and would have a cd case that could hold 10 CDs. I'd carefully pick my selections before going out, etc. so having it all easibly accessible in this tiny little thing was awesome. I even have ipod accessories, such as portable speakers. my ipod allegiance is pretty pricey though for me it's been worth it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>with all the stuff we've been reading about piracy, downloads, p2p, this made me start thinking about my own music consumption habits. when I was younger, i was obsessed with collecting cds, for any birthday or christmas present I would ask people for CDs. Though I downloaded music, and would burn CDs from my friends or from the local public library (surprisingly good collection), I still ended up spending lots of money on buying CDs. I guess it was because when I was burning from others, that limited who I could listen to to artists other people had (Whom may not be the ones I'm interested in). With downloading, it was easiest to download who was the most popular. More obscure bands were difficult to find. Also, it may have been easy to download a few songs, but it was harder to find complete album using different P2P software. possible, but it took work. I also had some sort of code of ethics in what I would download or burn. For example, there were certain artists who I absolutely had to buy their album and not just have a burned copy. Movie soundtracks and other compilations I burned with no hesitance, because since they weren't albums and put together cohesively for artistic purposes</p>

    <div class="content"><p>other people have touched upon this in Vaidhyanathan's work, but one of the things he talks about that i find really interesting is how people are taking films and creating their own edits and interpretations, like the Phantom Edit, or Puchkov's goblin dubs. What I liked about this was the idea that usually when people think about art, but particularly with film since production is such a process, what people view is often seen as a finished product. With what these folks are doing, they're asserting that art is never finished, and can always be reinterpreted, retinkered with, etc. </p>
<p>One theme we've talked about in class while discussing authorship, is one does the role of intention play. Does it matter what the author intends at all? As Vaidhyanathan writes, "an author cannot control how a character, idea or plot will be read, refasioned, or criticized".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>the blog, as expected is always post heavy monday to wednesday. it's time to give the other days some lovin'!</p>
<p>I was working at the QRC, and stumbled on some comic books drawn by Erika Moen, who graduated from Pitzer last year. She designed her own major, "Illustrated Storytelling". Her work is really fun and interesting. She took a bunch of different classes in art, English, creative writing, etc. With film and music, we've talked about how collaborative it is, because you need all these different people with different skills. It's intersting that in comic books, you need the different skills, but you can do it all yourself (though there are many classes where it's more collaborative, or uses a team of people for production).</p>
