<p>'Pick Up the Mic' -- Documentary about Queer Hip-Hop, or Homohop: 7:30 PM</p>
<p>'Queer Hip-Hop: it's a lot more than a stylish oxymoron in this surprising, fast-paced documentary on the world of queer rappers. Featuring searing public performances and raw, revealing interviews with the community's most significant players, the film captures an unapologetic underground music movement just as it explodes into the mainstream - defying the music industry's most homophobic genre in the process.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The following is just an emotional, crazy rant. This whole thesis process has, on one hand, been an intriguing process trying to find out what in the realm of media really interests me. However, not knowing what the topic I care about the most has made this entire semester, in terms of this project and thinking about thesis, like pulling teeth. Being overwhelmed by different things this semester, I decided to do my paper on something that I am interested in, though not necessarily for my thesis, just because I needed to start doing work on it. I'm writing on Wikipedia.  Now I have 20 pages ahead of me to write, and i cannot make myself do it. I have no idea what I am doing. Is it because I'm disorganized, or is it because I'm not feeling the topic? But, I'm not sure what topic I am feeling? Hopefully I will figure it all out soon. The last few weeks, I've been trying to read articles and books, and that's been getting nowhere. Today, I began really looking at Wikipedia for myself and trying to make up my own conclusions, and that's made me feel better, even though I'm not sure if i can sustain a 20 page paper on it, especially if it's a 20 page paper that I'm not even sure will lead to a thesis. If i could know what I want to do it on I would, but I don't. I wish I could force it and just be happy about it but i can.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This was sparked by ghostwriter's post, Yr colonial fantasty (or something like that). I have all these half-finished posts saved on my desktop that I need to catch up on posting. here is one of them!</p>
<p>Does anyone remember the show Colonial House on PBS? I was super addicted to it for awhile. It's part of this series of reality shows that, yes, even PBS had (including 1940's house, the 1900 house, frontier house, manor house, texas ranch house, etc.). The crux of these shows are to explore how modern day individuals would cope and react to trying to re-enact certain moments in history. Colonial House (which is the only one I've watched so far), shows a group of diverse individuals who try to recreate the colonial life of the year 1628. It includes a diverse cast, in terms of class, family situation, race and even sexual orientation.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Hey everybody! I'm going to tell you about one of my favorite websites! This is i-am-asian.com. Guess what? It's a website for McDonalds! That's right, they trademarked asserting one's asian identity as a marketing strategy!</p>
<p>I found out about this site a few years ago, when I went to the Tet (Lunar New year for Viet folks like me) festival in Little Saigon, which McDonalds helped sponsor. I was given a goodie bag that had the website on it. Inside, I got a flyer telling me about how Mulan 2 was coming out soon on DVD. Anyways, i was blown away by the website. When I first logged on, automatically playing in the background was the jingle "ba ba ba ba I'm lovin' it", accompanied by a slide show with different images of asian-americans, including a photo of a dog wearing an I-Am-Asian.com t-shirt. There was a welcoming paragraph that said something to the extent of how Asian-Americans juggle two cultures and are proud of both, and how you're just as likely to celebrate the customs of your country as going out for a big mac (i'm not kidding). the website also had a section about different asian countries, their cultures, holidays, etc. There was also a section about different asian-americans who had prominent jobs in the mcdonalds corporation. Now I feel empowered!!</p>

<p>1) Join the 5C Free Culture Club. It began last year, and has done such events as a remixing competitions (with workshops beforehand on how to use software like garageband to make remixes). They also brought in a speaker, Nelson Pavlosky, who was involved in the copyright case, OPG v. Diebold, and who help founded Free Culture Swarthmore (which was originally the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons). I think they meet on Thursday evenings. The person to contact would be Carolyn Davis, cdavis@scrippscollege.edu. It would be a great chance to begin addressing on a concrete level what we've been talking about in class in the abstract.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>a while ago, i made a post saying about how we haven't really discussed how digital technology is impacting other parts of the world, in a way that actually takes into account the specific situations of those parts of the world. one topic that may be an interesting example is the Nigerian film industry. When I went abroad to Cameroon, Nigerian films were pretty popular there, even though the area where I lived was a French speaking area and Nigerian films are typically in English (if in a Western language). For me, studying pop cultures of different countries is an interesting way to learn about that country and its culture, since so much of my personal experience has been shaped by Western culture. Also, what interests me is when countries are able to have a thriving pop culture of their own, in movies, in music, etc. and not be dominated by icons of the West, like Tomb Raider or Justin Timberlake (now i'm just trying to see how many times I can mention JT in a blog. I really don't like him THAT much, it's more that i'm really surprised that I like him at all so i feel like shouting in from the rooftops...but anyways). for instance, i'm a big fan of bollywood for that very reason. pop culture becomes a sign of resistance. also, it's interesting to see what topics and subjects are considered important, and what ways of addressing them. in Nigerian films, one could often see issues of HIV/AIDS, corruption, the occult, etc. that is specific to that country. in addition to that, i'm fascinated when pop cultures of one non-western country becomes really popular in another country, just because i'm curious about what leads to that, since western pop culture is so wide spread due to the specific reason of colonialism and imperialism. this is why nigerian cinema interests me so.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In his article "Models of Authorship in New Media," Manovich brings up "interactivity as collaboration between the author and the user" as another model of authorship. He uses focus groups as an example of this. However, in the last few years, these types of interactions are increasing and becoming even more collaborative. One particular example is the rise in prominence of fan culture. Snakes on the Plane, for instance, is an interesting case of viral marketing, as you all know. The most infamous line from the film, was shot afterwards based on a popular fan created internet video. There was also a music content, where the winners would be featured on the soundtrack of SoaP.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I meant to post on this a few days ago...but here goes! When I first read the introductory paragraph for Frasca's article, "Video Games of te Oppressed", I became intriged by the notion that video games have the potential to be a tool of social justice and tolerance. Though he mentions social justice, he doesn't explain it as a concep The word oppressed pretty much comes in the title, and in references to Boal's and Freire's works. Oppression, social justice, and tolerance become buzz words he throws around, and his analysis of how they can be addressed in video games seemed shallow to me as a result. While I liked how he talked abot Boal's theories about how theatre is a tool for  debate, not a goal or a solution in itself, and how it would be powerful to implement this philosophy in video games, his examples on what can be done did not live up to the grand ideas he was setting up. The examples of potential models of games, which he gives, seem to do little in addressing groups that have been institutionally marginalized. He doesn't really talk about these groups and their access to video games in general, which is salient to this issue. In an abstract way, one could argue that his proposed Pac-Man like game with bullies, invites dialogue about very real issues of how to deal with conflict. Likewise, his SIMS fantasy of an alcoholic mother character that you could merge with greenpeace activist, may also incite dialogue about issues of parenthood, substance abuse, and activism, and the plethora of different behaviors and personalities that could exist under these categories, which a user can use to modify the character. In a world where you're competing with Halo, and World of Warcraft, or whatever, would these games stand a chance?  Would they operate in a different space then mainstream games hold, like being mandatory in a classroom?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After I posted, I thought of another good example of how the relationship between form and content could either seem interesting or just gimicky.<br />
I am reminded of the difference between the films, "Time Code" by Mike Figgis and "Memento" by Christopher Nolan. (Did I make a concsious choice in saying who the author of the film was? Did I preface the director over the screenwriter or vice versa? Well in both films, the director was the screenwriter, so no choice between the two had to be made!) Granted, I saw Time Code once when I was 14, so maybe if I watch it again my opinion would be different. In Time Code, the screen is divided into four segments, and in each segment the viewer simultaneously. The story deals with love, sex, infidelity, with people working within the entertainment industry. The structure in a way did make the story, in the sense, that in one frame we see a woman witnessing her girlfriend cheating on her (she hid a mic on her girlfriend somehow, and was listening to the sounds in her car) while in the other frame, we see the situation of the cheating. you can see different angles of the same stories, it's layered, etc. Howver, I felt that this story didn't complement the structure well enough. It was just kind of a soap opera-y tale of people working in Hollywood. While the content was enhanced by the structure, in didn't take full advantage of the unique structure.</p>
