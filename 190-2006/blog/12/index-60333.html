    <div class="content"><p>When reading First Person, I immediately noticed the layout. For a book addressing issues of new media, merging forms of storytelling, it felt that the layout was designed to somewhat reflect that. At the tops of each page, is the name of the section and the name of the authors and reponders, positioned in a way where the text looks like links. There were other ways where the layout reminded me of a web page. Unlike other books, where the responses to an article would be merely posted after the article, here they are posted simultaneously with the article, on the bottom third of the page. This is interesting because while I was reading the article, I was visually reminded that there were multiple point of views to this topic, instead of being completely immersed in the text at hand as the end all be all. In a way, the reader is presented with the multitude of possibilities, that Murray is so fond of, in the reading experience. Also, since the responses didn't come directly at the end, after I read the article, I would have to turn back the pages and start over. This reminded me of being on a poorly designed page, where I would have to always press the back button after reading something to get back to the menu. In this way, the reading of the book isn't exactly a linear process. In addition to this, the articles are divided in columns, which is reminiscent of a newsletter or a newspaper, so it's like a combination of thesis different mediums born of different eras.</p>

- Lecture by Jason Gibbs</p>
<p>Thursday, November 2 at 4:15 - 5:30 p.m. (followed by reception)<br />
Hahn 108 (420 Harvard Ave.)</p>
<p>Ever since the end of World War II, civil conflict has divided Vietnamese society and, for a period, Vietnam itself. During the Cold War, an actual boundary at the 17th parallel blocked contact between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the North and the American-supported Republic of Vietnam in the South. While the communist North used centralized control to insure that its music served the interests of socialism and total mobilization for war, the South developed an eclectic, market driven popular music culture. Following the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, the victorious communists banned and worked to confiscate nearly all cultural products of the South. The music of the Republic of Vietnam, however, has survived and developed among the waves of refugees and immigrants from Vietnam to the U.S. and other countries in the West. Despite government suppression, it has also continuously thrived in Vietnam's black markets. Over the past decade the cultural division between Vietnam and diasporic Vietnamese moderated considerably with singers and songwriters from both sides regularly performing both in Vietnam and the West. This talk will discuss the music of the Republic of Vietnam and consider its genesis and continued popularity in Vietnam and overseas.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>During this class, we've talked about the future implications of digital technology. One aspect that interested me a lot is how it makes the world more globally connected. for instances, on websites like YouTube or Wikipedia, people from all over the world can post. However, this technology is not impacting people all over equally. While this technology may amaze me and impact the way I view things, for many people in the world their lives are barely touched by it, at least in a direct way. When I think of the revolutionizing innovations that Murray theorized about, I can't help but think that that revolution would be pretty localized. Though this technology may have the capacity to enable global connections and create equal access to information, the technology itself is not yet widespread enough throughout the world. For example, where I went for study abroad, internet was pretty limited, and only available at internet cafes, with modem connections. if you were in a large city and wanted to pay 5x the normal price, maybe you could get DSL (but that's pushing it). Something like YouTube would have little impact, since it would be impossibly long to load the page. Also, the price of tape players were pretty expensive, let alone imagining the price of a digital camera or camcorder, which is what many people use for their video postings.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Another topic I was thinking about doing was exploring networks that target specific identities. for example, in the last few years there has been the creation of a couple Asian-American TV networks, such as AZN TV and Imaginasian TV, and queer channels, such as LOGO, Here TV, and the now defunct QTV. There have been such channels for awhile, such as BET, Lifetime, Oxygen and Spike TV. However, what interested me about the Asian and the Queer ones (Besides the fact that those are both part of my identities and the channels suck less than Oxygen and Lifetime), is that they are new, so they are in the process of creating what asian-american identity is or what queer identity is in television. this is particularly true with asian-americans, since there is virtually no asian-american programming outside these networks. What statements do these channels say with their programming? Do they cater to a wide audience within their respective targets or do they offer a limited view? At home, I have access to AZN TV. It's programming is interesting. It has some specifically Asian-American programming, like one that looks at upcoming films, another that looks at asian-american comedians, and another that will document a few students while their applying to ivy league colleges. mixed in with asian-american programming, is straight up asian programming from asia, like those korean dramas i've been talking about. in this construction of asian-america, while the channel acknowledges that there is a unique asian-american identity, they create a link with both america and asia by featuring asian programming. asian-american encompasses many different people, it can apply to those who have just immigrated (if they choose to identify as such) or those born here after generations of parents living here. does AZN TV unite these people? in my own experience, my mom would watch the channel alot for her korean soap operas, which is pretty devoid from dealing with the issues of racism that asian-americans have to deal with. however, during the channel promos that would be shown during commercials, various hosts from other shows would talk about their experiences with being asian-american...so my lil asian mommy who doesn't directly discuss the issues of race and asian-americana becomes exposed to those issues, and i the american can become exposed to asian cultural exports. however, AZN TV is still pretty heterocentric (though there was one segment in the film show once that talked about the queer film "Saving Face" but other than that it's heterocity). also, almost all the asian-american hosts of shows are east asian, only one is south asian, only one is mixed. AZN TV only represents a very specific segment of Asian-America.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>3) Wikipedia. There's a lot to say in how it is deconstructing expert culture, since theoretically everyone has equal access in writing and editing no matter what one's resume is. does this resemble the messages of some progressive models of critical pedagogy, such as paulo freire's work about how education is divided up in teacher-students and students-teachers, with a less hierarchal flow of information? Or is this problematic since so many people use it? Is it spreading false information? Or is its rate of accuracy not too different from other sorts of media, but people fear it? Why do people go on wikipedia so much? simply because it's more accessible? is accessibility more important than accuracy? Because anyone can write what they want, you see the emergence of subjects that usually aren't taken seriously, from subcultures to pop culture, to the newest technologies, being presented as legitimate topics worth knowing about.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>2) In East Asian countries, like China, and Vietnam, Korean popular culture is ridiculously--.er--.popular. Television dramas, such as Winter Sonata, to singers such as Rain have become phenomenons across Asia. In fact, in 2006, Time Magazine named Rain (who is akin to Usher and JT) the second most influential entertainer in the world. Korean actors are some of the most highest paid outside of Hollywood. This first piqued my interest because a lot of people in my family, including my mom and cousins are really into Korean dramas. Also, when I went to Vietnam, Korean culture was the cool trend, from films to food.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Somehow, though I have a tenuous relationship with academia (not comfortable in ivory towers), while unsuccessfully trying to find one thesis topic, everything suddenly became really interesting to me. Here's a list of random topics that are interesting that I have yet to blog about, though I have no idea whether I will do any of these or not. Everything interests me but not paricularly more than anything, so I think i might settle on wikipedia (since that was what my proposal was on). What do you think my thesis should be on? Just comment on them!<br />
:</p>
<p>1) Music copyright law and its impact on tv/film: With current copyright, its really expensive to get the rights to show someone else's stuff in your work, even if it's incidentally there. This is really impacting documentaries. For example, there was this case where in a documentary they were just shooting random people, and someone's phone when off and the ring tone was the Rocky theme, and the company expected the filmmakers to pay for the rights. How is this impacting filmmaking and television production? In the film, I am Sam, the featuring of Beatles song was an important part of the narrative. However, since the filmmaker couldn't afford the rights, instead she features Beatles covers, by Rufus Wainwright, Sarah Mclachlan, etc. Another interesting example are these two documentaries about Morrissey and how he has a large Latino fan base. One of them, Viva Morrissey, features a lot of music, and has been having trouble getting rights, and hasn't been widely distributed, just in festival circuits. Another film, Is It Really So Strange, works around the law by not having music at all, which is pretty interesting, the idea of a music documentary without music. Is the need to work around copyright law creating new innovations?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>related to the point of having a plethora of realities possible in storytelling, Murray talks about fan cultures, and how they are able to create their own alternate possibilities and readings of their favorite characters, though mediums such as fan fiction and what not. however, with fan fiction (for film or TV at least), what I always found somewhat lacking or not as satisfying, is the fact that it's not the same medium. this reminded me of what we talked about with "understanding comics", about how meaningful it was that theory on a medium was conveyed in that very medium. it can be jarring when there is that disconnect.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One of Murray's point that really struck me was in the first chapter, "Harbingers of the Holodeck". She talks about multiform narratives, giving examples such as "It's a Wonderful Life", where altnernative worlds are possible. With the advent of computers, expressing what she calls constantly bifurcating plotlines are becoming more possible. One quote I enjoyed was "The commitment to any particular story is a painful diminiution of the intoxicating possibilities of the blank page." I have noticed this sentiment in both my personal life and in how I enjoy narratives. In my personal life, i have crippling indecisiveness (which prolonged my thesis-topic finding process) is based on the idea that in making a choice, i am simultaneously shutting the door to a lot of possibilities. I have watched most of the TV series, "Queer as Folk". My favorite episode has always been the pilot, not necessarily because it was a better written episode (though it may have been), but because of all the possibilities it had, the potential relationships, the potential plots, character arcs, story points. What draws me to that episode is not necessarily how good it was but of all the potential of goodness it showed. From then on, of course, the show had to pick directions, letting some possible story ideas that were hinted at lead to no fruition. For example, in the pilot, it was hinted that one friend had a crush that borderlined on obsession for another friend. this could've been a very complicated interesting relationship dynamic, but is never really returned to in the series. Though it very well may be because "Queer as Folk" is a trashy show, but I feel like the actual show was never as good as what I thought it could be when I had watched the first episode.</p>
