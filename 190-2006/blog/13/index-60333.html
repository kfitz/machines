    <div class="content"><p>...here are some commercials!</p>
<p>I know, I know, the idea of voluntarily watching commercials doesn't seem that appealing (there are, of course, a few exceptions) but I'm writing my thesis on the Dove Real Beauty advertising campaign and I'd like to get some input from the class.  </p>
<p>A bit of background:<br />
Dove's Real Beauty campaign was launched in late 2004, and first caught people's attention with the infamous average-women-in-their-skivvies <a href="http://www.jeffpidgeon.com/uploaded_images/real%20women-789598.jpg">photo</a>.  The campaign is "intended to serve as a starting point for societal change and act as a catalyst for widening the definition and discussion of beauty" (Dove.com)  As I'm sure you'll realize by looking at the photo, the campaign is fighting the stereotypical size two model found in most advertising.  The campaign has grown quite rapidly and now has a series of commercials: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=L_aDpmfAzxI">here</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=gUsKIApTewQ">here</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AOLfyUcYfpo">here</a>.</p>

It's come in handy for quite a few papers of mine, and, appropriately, it's available online for free!  Personally, chapter five, "Multi-user Dungeons and Alternate Identities," is one of my favorites.  </p>
<p>Also, if any of you love South Park as much as I do (and I love it a whole lot) then you should DEFINITLY watch this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=TBBbM2iFQ1g">episode</a>, it's pretty relevant to our reading for this week.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I don't like talking in class.  But, I have something I wanted to say about Thomas Kinkade--</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say we came to a general consensus that we would all burn his paintings if given the chance, because they're ugly, or cheesy, or boring, whatever.  Sure, I would never want one hanging on my wall, country just isn't my style- but the guy has talent, regardless of what he uses it for.  I can't help but feel that part of the reason people look down on his paintings (factory aspect aside) is because they're all over the place; you can buy Thomas Kinkade anything (I know, my grandma has quite a collection) and at quite a range of prices, from affordable to why-the-hell-are-you-spending-that-much-on-a-painting-of-a-snowy-cottage.  But I couldn't help feeling that the discussion got a bit "uppity" -for lack of a better word.  Do we look down on his paintings because anyone can have one?  Because of what he chooses to paint?  Because he turned his paintings/style into a business and is making a killing doing it?  Because they aren't rare, they aren't in a museum?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I was going to write about how Google is taking overe the world.  A few weeks ago I had a discussion with some people in my hall about Google being Jesus, because the internet was "broken," except for Google!  In any case, I got a bit caught up with Google buying YouTube but never got around to posting about it.  People have posted YouTube links on here before, but I'm not sure that anyone discussed Google buying YouTube (at quite a hefty sum...)</p>
<p>But, just as I was going to post about it, I read <a href="http://screens.blogs.nytimes.com/">this</a>, which is slightly more relevant to our class.  So, thoughts anyone?  Are blogs doomed because they're bound to language?  Are blogs-in-translation out of the question?  And to what extend is a blog-in-translation the same as the original?  While this video doesn't rely on language, it does rely on Western pop-culture references, so can it really be universal?  Interesting to note that this commentary was posted in a NY Times blog...</p>

On the other hand, I did feel a bit strange reading a comic book in the airport.  This is probably because I've never been "into" comic books.  I own a few Calvin and Hobbes, and the Maus books, but I guess I never caught the comic fever.  When I got on the plane (after the pilot announced we would be sitting on the runway for TWO HOURS!) the man sitting next to me asked how I was doing and I told him I didn't mind the delay so much because I had a lot of work to get done.  Then I pulled out the book, and he gave me one of the oddest looks I've ever received.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I think the good ol' what is/what is not art discussion has popped up on this blog before, I'm thinking in the discussion of Duchamp's Fountain (discussion isn't the right word, I don't think, is there another word for the commenting we do here?).  I found McCloud's rather brief definition of art pretty interesting, and I'd like to hear (read?) other people's comments.<br />
McCloud writes on page 164 "Art, as I see it, is any human activity which doesn't grow out of either of our species' two basic instincts: survival and reproduction!"  This seems too simple to me.  He later draws a distinction between art and "pure" art (page 169), but how did other people react to this passage with the cavepeople?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Or, <em>House of Leaves</em>.  </p>
<p>At first, I kind of hated the book.  It was too big, and there were too many footnotes.  Let me just put it out there that I DESPISE footnotes.  I make a point not to read footnotes, out of protest, unless I absolutely have to.  That and the prospect of turning my book upside-down and every which way to read it seemed like too much energy for homework.  </p>
<p>And then I got past the introduction and discovered that a) I was able to read this book for (literally) hours at a time without realizing it, b) that I was reading and enjoying the footnotes, and c) that I was taking it way too seriously.  Remember the part where Johnny asks the reader to imagine that something is behind them?  I tried to find it just now but it's buried in a footnote and I don't have the time/energy to read back through (I should have marked it the first time around but I don't like writing in "pretty" [read: non-academic] books).  Anyways, it scared the hell out of me.  I went into my friend's room to read.</p>

And what did I find?  A whole <em>slew</em> of celebrities donning face paint for the Keep a Child Alive campaign (KCA is an "urgent response to the AIDS pandemic ravaging Africa" www.keepachildalive.org).  Go to the <a href="http://www.keepachildalive.org"> website</a>, in the middle of the page you'll see a column titled "I AM AFRICAN" and a picture of someone involved in the campaign (I got Iman).  My favorite quote?  "Each and every one of us contains DNA that can be traced back to our African ancestors."  So, only by feeling that <em>I</em> am somehow connected to the plight in Africa will I feel obligated, or willing, to donate money to fight AIDS?  Riiiight.  Although, to be honest, it's a sickly clever approach.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The Independent, a newspaper out of London, recently put out a special "African Issue" as part of the Red Campaign (www.joinred.com for some guilt-free consumerism!) and sent half of the revenues to fight AIDS in Africa.  And on the cover is the notorious Kate Moss, in black paint!  I'd love to elaborate on this, but the LSAT prep-book has my name written all over it so I don't have enough time right now.  Anyways, here's a link to the <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article1655627.ece"> article</a>.  A lot of readers are upset, calling this a form of racism, and arguing that an African woman should have appeared on the cover, rather than Kate in black-face.</p>
