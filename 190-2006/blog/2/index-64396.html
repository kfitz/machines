It seems like people in other majors, as well as Media Studies majors from other classes, are well into such lit reviews, but maybe they are just either self-driven or guided by their readers?

Also, will it also discuss my other grandmother, whom I will be interviewing this winter and for whom I will be creating another website. I hope to link the two sites together so that I can make a comparison of the merged site to the book Parallel Lives by Plutarch, a Greek guy. Parallel Lives was one of the first biographies. This would lend itself to research that did focus more on literary form and its historical development. I could study other exemplary biographies and translate what they do well to the electronic medium, just as many screenwriters have done when adapting books to film.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, so as mentioned at the end of last entry, I don't think I will be able to take advantage of the inspirational professor I met with for two hours two weeks ago. This is because he deals more with simple, practical classroom usages of media, whereas I need to do a theoretical paper. I now have appointments with two other professors, who will hopefully be my readers. Profesora Donapetry, a Spanish teacher specializing in women's studies, might be very helpful because I am will be continuing the work I started over the summer, the creation of an online biography of my grandmother (a Mexican woman.) Profesora Donapetry would be able to help me in the content of the website, perhaps not so much the format. However, the content and its cultural implications might help shape the structure. For example, the website's audience might be older (closer in age to my grandmother.) And many viewers may be from Mexico, where digital technology is less available. Both older and technologically inexperienced people would need a very simple interface, perhaps one that starts with an introductory video, which is very attention-grabbing. I could then comment on the importance of the image in an increasingly globalized, international world, and I could expound on the differing experiences of the internet for people of various ages. Yes, the content does inform the structure.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I met with my potential first reader for thesis, I was very impressed with his ideas for simple, yet practical applications of media to education. The ideas particularly resounded with me, because over the summer I had an internship at the University of California, San Diego, in their Professional Development Institute, which dealt with helping teachers better their techniques. We held a conference for the Los Angeles Unified School District (Local District 6) for ESL (English as a Second Language) kids, as well as a retreat for a new charter school that didn't know how to find resources. Both could use simple applications of media to help kids in their classroom and find administrative resources. Also, I read some e-newsletters on the use of technology and education with input from teachers on what worked for them, and my potential thesis reader's ideas were very much inline with the ideas teachers reported worked best. Here are some of his ideas:</p>

He works for the Foreign Language Department, teaching one German class, but he is also responsible for integrating technology into classroom learning, particularly in language conversation classes. He is really an interesting guy, and I am almost positive that he should be my first reader. This is because my interests dovetail with his pretty well. Furthermore, he is the only faculty member I have found who deals with both media and education directly, which is why I am considering someone I hadn't even met yet to be my first reader.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>In the case of 1920's director Tod Browning, the auteur theory of the director's importance to the work is very much in play. He has a strong background in the dark underworld of circus life, which many cite as the main influence for his movies. His "biographical legend" has been embellished so much that it is hard to determine where his life experience ends and his creative work begins. This "blurring of filmography and biography" (239) is really interesting to me, because it represents the unclear boundaries between life and art. I have always found that ambiguity unsettling, and it is why I would not want to go into a career that strongly depends on one's personal inner world. Actors dabble so much in the minds of their characters that they may practically feel possessed. Even if that is not the case, actors can have trouble when they try to stop acting and face "real life." (See movies like Becoming Julia with Annette Benning.)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am relieved that Staiger considers the more structuralist approaches (Barthes, Foucault) as "dodges" (46), because that is definitely how I saw them. I feel that, in the end, we are just going to realize that "expression of the self [is] a viable, if contingent, act" (49). To me, that means that yes, the author is important, but not all-important. If we as a society and as individuals can act in moderation while assessing authorial value, then we can avoid so much meta discussion. It seems to me that the real dodge here is discussing authorship instead of authoring. When do we start writing our theses?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Wow! I did not realize how much time and effort academics have put into studying this idea of authorship! Janet Staiger's article sums up seven approaches taken so far in these studies, and I find the last three particularly interesting (author as reading strategy, site of discourses, technique of the self.) They seem to explain the transition that happened from our first week's readings to our second week's readings, namely from the structuralist idea that the author is dead to the more post-structuralist idea that a plurality of voices must be recognized. They take it one step further, though, by making a distinction that I think we were getting at last time; we go from having no author ("insistent unconscious writing by material discourses" [46]) to having an author as a representative, a performative that is "the repetition of [individual] statements" (51). This is powerful in that it acknowledges voices without putting too much emphasis on them. This approach is helpful in addressing issues of agency for minorities, which we brought up with bell hooks and Marchessault.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I just wanted to express my thoughts on the link between this week's two articles. I think it is apparent that they are both about exploring the significance of underrepresented voices, be they from women, racial minorities, etc. What stands out to me is how different their conclusions are about suggestions for the future of authorship, as compared to last week's readings. Marchessault frankly states, "Unlike Barthes' Great Authors (MallarmÃ©, Proust, Balzac), women have nothing to gain from the destruction of the author at this historical juncture" (89). Women have been working for literary recognition for so long, and just as they are approaching this prize, Barthes is calling for its obliteration.</p>
