    <div class="content"><p>Last night I went to see the film BABEL with some friends and first of all, I would recommend it to anyone with a spare $10 and a couple of hours of free time. The film is beautiful, with magnificent scenes from various continents and it is visually magnificent.  The music is wonderful and the cast is great (I've never really been a Brad Pitt fan before, but his short amount of screen time in this film is actually really good). I love Gael Garcia Bernal and was pleased with his performance, but saddened by his small amount of screen time. The cast as a whole is great, even the kids.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to discuss this type of movie. I'll try to not spoil it for those of you who want to see it.  The film is constructed like Crash.  The film has storylines that connect at the end, despite all the major characters being on different continents and living very different lives.  I find this very interesting in terms of the narrative. Jumping between all the plots leaves the audience in suspense about one plot, then creates suspense for them in the next one.  I love this style of filmmaking. Films that have a straight-forward, linear narrative often have scenes that are slow, or not as enticing and I often lose interest. This choppy, non-linear style keeps drawing the audience back into the film and with this film, the variety of characters and scenes is amazing. Offering this wide range is beneficial, as it gives a wide variety of scenes, a wonderful ensemble cast (much like Crash), and different aspects for audience members to relate to.  I find it very interesting that this type of film has gained such popularity and prestige.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Personally, I think you should all go out and rent Who Killed the Electric Car? (or put it in your Netflix queue). I was bummed when we had class and it was showing at Scripps, but it just released on DVD yesterday and I watched it this afternoon instead of writing a Spanish essay and I could not be more pleased with my decision. It is an extremely well-put together documentary that kept my attention and gave me a massive amount of information about something that I had little or no knowledge about before.<br />
Just a bit about authorship before my verdict in the murder case and other rantings. The film brought me back to issues that we discussed about Authorship and Film.  This film was written and directed by the same guy, who clearly has a passion for the topic, but he use of other materials (clips from movies, television broadcasts, etc) add a lot to the film and make it much better, so there is a blurring of authorship, like there is with many documentaries.  Also, I expected the narrator to be the voice of the director/writer and was a bit surprised when the credits rolled around to see that the voice was actually that of.... Martin Sheen. Interesting. It is also quite clear that it took a lot of people to make this film work and the authorship was a collaborative effort, rather than just the director.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Sometimes I hate computers... I just wrote this really long blog about this and accidentally hit the back button and lost it all. Anyway, I'll try again and it probably won't be nearly as well written since I have class in 10 minutes, but oh, well. </p>
<p>I recently heard that O.J. Simpson has turned author.  However, his writing is not a straight up autobiography or anything like that.  He wrote a hypothetical book about how he would have killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, had he done it.  Not really a confession, yet not really a good way of clearing his name.  In addition, he has taped an interview that will air at the end of the month that goes over the material in the book, describing how he would have executed the murders. Anyway, my initial reaction was mortification.  How can he write the gruesome details about how he would have killed his ex-wife and the mother of his children even if he had?? Doesn't he have a soul?  While this feeling still remains strong, I started thinking... he just wants to be back in the spotlight and this is a pretty unique and crazy way to get back in the spotlight.  He can't be charged for the crimes again, so why not hypothetically confess?? Other people wrote a million books about the trial and speculated what happened, why shouldn't O.J. author his own book and clear up exactly what happened?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>so reading cnn.com today there is a cnn video about how a video that was put up on YouTube shows a possible case of police brutality. While it's still under debate about whether or not the officers used excessive force, I find it interesting that the reason it came into question was the video on YouTube.<br />
Here is the video:<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKEv2gvIO5o</p>
<p>There are claims that the officers' testimonies do not match up with what is shown on the YouTube video and it may actually be considered relevant evidence in the case.  However, many critics are saying that since only a small portion of the event are in the video, people can't get the whole picture and see what leads up to the situation.  There is an interesting article against the police brutality claims on abcnews.com :</p>

    <div class="content"><p>OK, so someone blogged about last week's episode of South Park and Cartman's anticipation of the new Nintendo Wii being released.  Well, South Park is amazing and I wanted to put something out there that was in that episode that everyone should know about. Some of you have probably heard about this already, but for those of you who haven't... it's pretty interesting.<br />
So in the episode, Mrs. Garrison is instructed to teach the class about evolution and has an issue teaching it to her students. Basically, there is a reference to believing in a Flying Spaghetti Monster as god.  This is not just a random South Park comment.  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists and it is actually quite popular.  Followers of the religion are called Pastafarians. A man named Bobby Henderson had an issue with a Kansas school district teaching the theory of Intelligent Design as well as evolution and wrote a letter to the school board about teaching all the various theories of Intelligent Design if they were going to teach any. He goes on to explain his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and how it should be taught in school. He explains that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth and placed all the evidence of evolution here. It was actually very detailed and included everything from diagrams to a graph explaining that the reason we have global warming is the due to the decrease in the number of pirates in the world since the 1800's.  Anyway, you can read the open letter at this site:</p>

I got one of my "CNN Breaking News" emails today, expecting to see something about the outcome of elections, how election day was going, or something like that.  No, what CNN feels is most important to tell me today, Election Day, is that Britney Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline.  And CNN is supposed to be one of the serious news sources that will tell me important information about the world.  While I see that some citizens view things such as Britney's love life as something more important that voting (maybe that's why we have such low voter turnouts), I would think that the CNN Breaking News Bulletins would be saved for something a little more academic or political and that people could find out stuff about Britney's divorce procedures on people.com ??</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Basically, I went on the Price is Right today and I need to blog more, so I am going to write about the experience and connect it to authorship. First of all, ridiculous people go on the Price is Right.  It was amazing... people from Florida with shirts that said "My Gator is Neutered" are a prime example.  Anyway, I went on the show with my rugby team (and a few friends of ruggers) and a girl on the team was picked (Angie Martinez, she goes to Pitzer).<br />
It got me thinking... I was reminded of our discussion of Authorship and Film because I got to see so many elements of the show happening, such as the cameras and all the crew running around to make sure everything was right.  It allowed me to see how many people really are involved in the process.  And also it got me thinking about the formulaic narratives we have been discussing with Hamlet on the Holodeck and First Person.  The Price is Right follows such a formula, it's almost ridiculous.  However, the audience plays a role in the outcome of the show and plays an important part in the show environment.  The contestants are picked from the audience and typically the members of the audience are frequent viewers, so the viewer is somewhat involved in the outcome of the show.  And while the producers pick who those selected audience members are, the audience is still involved in creating the atmosphere and helping the game players choose prices.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, since the blog is so significant to our class, I thought this might be of interest to some of you in the class. I was listening to NPR yesterday and the topic of military blogs was discussed. Basically, a lot of members of the military post blogs as a way to keep in touch with family and friends, as well as using the blog as a way of speaking out about their experiences, kind of like keeping a journal.  Many people see this as a positive way for the general public to stay connected with our military and the war in general.  Well, the government is of course, worried about security. The potential risk of bloggers leaking information about the military strategies has made the military begin to restrict the blogging rights of the troops to prevent potential leaking on blogs. So, basically we trust our troops with guns and defending democracy, but not with a computer and a mouse.   I thought this was interesting. The military is censoring the blogs because they feel the troops could let out information that could harm them or the goals of the U.S. in general. Is the military simply trying to protect the troops? Should the military officers be allowed to control what is on the internet for the safety of our military strategies and troops?  Should blogs in general be censored??</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, this class has me constantly thinking about authorship in many aspects of my life, and in particular my use of the internet recently. The reading for this week and last week have made me really look at the internet more critically and think about websites that I frequently visit.  One site that I enjoy that relates really well to authorship is   www.postsecret.com  .  It is a site where people send in anonymous postcards that have their inner-most secrets written on them. I think this is important in relation to authorship specifically because of the anonymous element the internet provides. Like blogging, which can be anonymous, the internet provides people a space to voice their opinions and feelings without having to do it in awkward social settings or in a place where they feel they could be scrutinized or openly judged. What I like about postsecret.com is that people can let out these secrets that they have bottled up inside and it allows them to have the emotional release of telling someone, without actually having to tell someone.  The site also does a lot to help people who have various issues from eating disorders to depression.  It is like an anonymous support group at times, where people can share and others are there for them and can respond to their postcards. People all over the world can connect with these people's secrets, realize that they are not the only ones with problems and realize that everyone has secrets they wish they could let out.</p>
