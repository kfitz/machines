    <div class="content"><p>So... as we all begin to turmoil over the horrible 't' word, I just thought I'd lay out my general idea and see if anyone had feedback/ideas/criticisms, etc.  </p>
<p>Basically, I took this Hip Hop Culture class while I was abroad in New Zealand.  Seeing as hip hop culture has its roots in the United States, it was interesting to study it outside of the US (although my prof was American) and the class actually focused on tying in the abundant use of rap music in the Maori community in New Zealand and other marginalized groups across the globe.  This inspired me.  So I want to write about international hip hop on the small scale, i.e. how individuals outside the US use hip hop as a form of voice to speak out against oppression in their individual communities.  I'm debating whether I tie this in with the early stages of US hip hop, before it was a mainstream commodity and most rappers used hip hop to communicate within their communities and speak out about their daily experiences and oppressions.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The part of this article that interested me most was the role of genre. Is a director more credible if he can successfully make films in multiple genres?  Or is it better to focus on one genre and add a unique twist to this genre??  Bazin's arguments about genres throughout the article were quite interesting.  While Bazin argues that "the skill of the popular artist consists of fulfilling predictable expectations while introducing a renovatory degree of variation", it can also noted that maybe directors of these genre films simply know how to read the formula that genre typically follows and fit the script into the formula.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I recently realized that although I have read the articles and discussed the controversy about James Frey's book "A Million Little Pieces" with friends and relatives, I have not discussed it in an academic setting. I feel as though the issue of authorship that we are focusing on actually connects really well with the controversy.<br />
First of all, I have read the book, but I read it after the realizations that some parts of it were false. I believe this knowledge skewed my perception of the novel while I was reading it. However, I feel it's really interesting that our society was so connected with this particular authorial situation.  Why was it so important that the novel line up perfectly with the events in Frey's real life?  Was it simply because he lied and said that the book was non-fiction?? or were people disappointed because their connection with the author's story was shattered?</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>hooks' reading really made me question who her intended readers were.  While she makes it quite clear that she wants black women (and men) to read and understand the oppression society's racial constructions, it is evident throughout her essay that she also wants the white, intellectual male population to read and interpret her work. In one part of her essay she states that she worried about her arguments lacking conviction.  Well, it is possible that if these arguments were more common or better known (especially among the dominant white male intellectuals), they would have the conviction necessary to make an impact. While reading her essay, it was clear to me that she knew that many potential readers were going to be these white intellectual males she is discussing. She clearly knows this, as she says she is cautious when discussing such topics.  However, the essay is also potentially aimed at blacks to raise their awareness of the societal situations they are placed in everyday. So clearly she can have more than one target audience, but I find myself torn as to discover which one she wanted to reach or influence more...</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>While reading the Marchessault, I'm not gonna lie, I found myself a bit confused at times.  Hopefully tomorrow's discussions will point me to a clear interpretation. However, I found the reading interesting and many of the key elements Marchessault noted really stuck in my head (particularly the connection between many white males  denying authorship was when marginalized people who had historically not received complete authority to authorship.) So like some of the other blogs, I'm going to focus on the part that seemed most coherent and interesting to me.  On page 86 Marchessault states "In opposition to Barthes' dead author, the lack of authority that women writers encounter is not celebrated but healed and overcome through political community.  The communication of experiences particular to women's lives is precisely what should constitute women's writing, forging a path for a new unity of women readers and writers that redefines the universal."</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I would have to agree with others that Barthes' essay was a little extreme for me. The essay was not the most coherent reading I have ever done and the messages were thoughtful, but a little too intense.  While I do agree that text should be interpreted through the eyes of the reader and deconstructed for what it actually is, I do not think the author needs to be completely dismissed.  Learning about an author after interpreting one of their texts can introduce a new criticism or shed new light upon the text that the reader would not have seen without that knowledge. I do believe it is important to acknowledge that there is never a single author of a work (society, surroundings, family, etc. all influence an author).  Foucault talks about how literary works are a result of cultural settings, not a single individual.  While I agree with the idea that society influences all authors and their ideas are not necessarily unique because they are constantly receiving ideas from their surroundings, I think it is important to consider the writer's background to take into account any spin they may have placed in the writing. So while I agree that literary works are not the result of one individual, but the result of a cultural experience, it is important to realize that one person did take the time to put their experience or opinions into a work and although they are influenced by the world they live in, they are still the person who expressed this experience.</p>
