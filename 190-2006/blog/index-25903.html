    <div class="content"><p>During this class, we've talked about the future implications of digital technology. One aspect that interested me a lot is how it makes the world more globally connected. for instances, on websites like YouTube or Wikipedia, people from all over the world can post. However, this technology is not impacting people all over equally. While this technology may amaze me and impact the way I view things, for many people in the world their lives are barely touched by it, at least in a direct way. When I think of the revolutionizing innovations that Murray theorized about, I can't help but think that that revolution would be pretty localized. Though this technology may have the capacity to enable global connections and create equal access to information, the technology itself is not yet widespread enough throughout the world. For example, where I went for study abroad, internet was pretty limited, and only available at internet cafes, with modem connections. if you were in a large city and wanted to pay 5x the normal price, maybe you could get DSL (but that's pushing it). Something like YouTube would have little impact, since it would be impossibly long to load the page. Also, the price of tape players were pretty expensive, let alone imagining the price of a digital camera or camcorder, which is what many people use for their video postings.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am usually more in favor of moving forward in class bloggation than posting upon material that has already been discussed at length but  I was reminded today of something I was going to blog about in Hamlet on the Holodeck but never got around to it.</p>
<p>I was interested in Janet Murray's idea of a literary hierarchy.  At the start of Chapter 10, Hamlet on the Holodeck? on page 273, Murray returns to the question raised by Aldous Huxley, "Will the stories brought to us by the new representational technologies 'mean anything' in the same way that Shakespeare's plays mean something, or will they be 'told by an idiot'"?  She continues to say that we often assume that stories told in one medium "are intrinsically inferior to those told in another." She uses the example of Shakespeare and Jane Austen and how they were once considered to be working in less legitimate formats than those used by predecessors such as Homer.  Toda the same thing occurs much in the same way for television and cinema. As Murray says, "The very act of watching television is routinely dismissed as inherently inferior to the act of reading, regardless of content."</p>

Tipped off by an article in the LA Times, I went looking for muppets videos... and I have to say, I've become an instant youtube fan. It's such a neat space for people to post both original and very very unoriginal work. It's such an interesting mix of funny news clips, overly personal video diaries ranging from funny to scary to boring, and a few diamonds in the rough - like these re-thinkings of sesame street characters. I'm not claiming that they are brilliant works of art, and they contain no original content.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm glad someone mentioned in class that Murray gets creepy when she fantasizes about audience members providing "support" for characters on ER.  But Murray seems to have been right-on in calling that production companies would attempt to blur the lines between entertainment and reality.  She writes that as computer &amp; television become further intertwined, audiences will be able to access the virtual world of a television show, complete with remnants of the personal life of each character.</p>
<p>Earlier in this blog someone called attention to LonelyGirl15, three producers' attempt to build hype for a movie by introducing a main character as a real person through the vlogging world.  The idea initially seemed to have succeeded (15 million views), but I wonder whether audience members were turned off when they realized they had been duped.  LG15's followers thought they were comforting a legit human, while any crazeball comforting an ER patient has willingly suspended his/her disbelief.  I'm not sure if the LG15 movie is still happening, but if it is it will be interesting to see whether the hype has a negative or positive effect.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I thought it was cool how Janet Murray really thought out unique ways that the computer could tell a story, epitomized in the three versions of a tragic suicide that she gave: "mind as tragic labyrinth" (176), "web of mourning," (177) and "simulation and destiny" (178). I think it would be a very interesting experience to occupy all those points of view for one situation--first person, third person other character, and omniscient third person. Having the power to enact some sort of chanage (while being omniscient) is further engaging because you contribute. The one that got me most was the "mind as tragic labyrinth" because it recognizes the fundamental connection between a computer's programming and how our brains are configured. For example, Murray talks of blocked off or fading happy memories. Memories do actually got blocked, such as in people who are traumatized. Unlike a stream-of-consciousness novel, digital narrative could actually simulate this neurological activity. I must admit that, as much as I am frustrated by disorienting experimental stuff like this (or like Michael Joyce's "Afternoon"), I do think this literature is uniquely beneficial in the end. It's an experience, not an analysis, and once I realize that, I can enjoy it more. Yeah! I think I'm caught up on my blogs for a while!</p>

We were taken on tours of two companies the first day. (I had DDB and Muse, if that means anything to anyone. They both do Wells Fargo. Also, DDB did the Emmy-winning Ameriquest Superbowl commercial where it looks like a guy is killing a cat when his date walks in. Anyways...) Then we had time for networking in a room where many, many agencies had booths with brochures set up.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I hope everyone liked the presentation our group gave for Hamlet on the Holodeck. I had a lot of fun--and not just with the wine. I thought it was cool that we could integrate so much real-life stuff into the theoretical dissections of literary development. I am thinking, in particular, of "Duck Amuck"--the Daffy Duck cartoon.</p>
<p>This cartoon was fun to watch because I felt like I was a kid again. That's involuntary, associative memory for you. In another class, I just had to read all about Proust's feelings on the unique power of involuntary memory. For him, it was a cookie, not a cartoon, that brought back childhood memories that he couldn't make himself remember. At any rate, there is power in the object that can do that: awaken emotions and visceral memories that the intellect and just words can't reach.</p>

McCloud says, "Art, as I see it, is any human activity which doesn't grow out of either of our species' two basic instincts: survival and reproduction!" (164). This brought so much controversy because artists work to survive, and normal ways of survival, such as preparing food, have an art or technique to them. We gave tons of other great examples, too (like that unexpected one about the guy who cooked and ate his own fat, that was taken from him through liposuction, and called that art.)</p>
