    <div class="content"><p>While listening to Metallica, I had a thought. As is often the case when I am listening to Metallica, I was catching up on my world affairs. By this I mean that I was buried in a Newsweek, able to escape only for second at a time to check people's away messages.<br />
As I was reading, I came across two articles on the Michael Richards incident, which is being referred to in the media concisely as "the rant." Anyways, I had already posted in the blog about this rant right after it happened and I was, as was much of right-thinking America, very critical of the guy who plays Kramer.<br />
Anyways, one of the articles was about Michael Richards' recent 'apology tour' as it is being called by many. The article was not just about his apology, but about the utter slough of celebrity apologies for various deplorable shit that they've done lately. From Senator Foley to Mel Gibson, to Kramer himself, celebrity apologies are everywhere. However, in Kramer's case, his offense was caught on camera, which sucks for him. Anyways, the article, which I won't try to summarize made the point that it isn't a positive thing that Richards said these things, but it is a positive thing that there has been such a public outcry, and he feels the need to go on an apology tour.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>As I was sitting in work at rains today, i was reading up for my thesis. This includes a bunch of stuff about the South and whiteness and such, and i started to reflect. I reflected all the way back to the fourth grade.<br />
I don't remember much from the fourth grade, but I have distinct memories of music class. For example, I was downright sick with a recorder in my hands.<br />
Anyways, we sung a lot of songs that I didn't really understand at the time, such as a lot of sailor songs and things like that that had terms in them i'd never heard before. One song that I have SPECIFIC memories of singing, and having NO IDEA what it was about was "Dixie." Now, I'm not sure what other people think of that, but I find it odd that Fourth graders are being made to sing a song that is a rallying cry for (mostly racist) white southerners. Now I looked back at the lyrics just now, which I couldn't recall most of. here they are:</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Siva Vaidhyanathan's Anarchist in the Library spells out a lot of problems that the United States and United States copyright law specifically, are facing today. One story that I thought was really interesting was that of Alice Randall. She was the woman who wrote The Wind Done Gone. She and Houghton Mifflin were sued by the estate of whoever wrote Gone With the Wind because it used their "property." The Supreme Court ruled that Randall's book was a parody of the original work Gone with the Wind. Parodies are apparently allowed under current copyright law. </p>
<p>Siva sums it up perfectly at the end of this story though when he begs the question, what if Randall did not have the help of a major publisher? Would she have won this decision if she were less important to a huge company financially? I may be skeptical of the US court system, but I tend to think she would not have. I think if it was the estate of a famous American writer, versus some woman who "stole" most of her story, the courts would side with the estate.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>While reading Free Culture, I was super interested in doujinshi, mentioned in the first chapter. These are comics that are essentially copies of other comics that are altered to make it the authors' own.<br />
I think I can see why an art form like this is great, and why it is negative. Of course, from a consumer standpoint, it is great. Allowing artists to be more free with 'borrowing' or whatever we call it will probably mean more content is produced. And if there is good ideas, it benefits the consumer to have many artists (possibly) copy them and expand on them.<br />
However, from the artists' standpoint, I can see how you wouldn't want other artist to use your ideas to make money that you probably could have made using your own intellectual properties.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Speaking of rants, and terrible shit being caught on camera and put on Youtube, this post is about a hybrid of those two things. I'm assuming some people have seen the clip of Michael Richards performing at the Laugh Factory last friday.</p>
<p>Well, for those who haven't and don't know, Michael Richards is the actor who played Kramer in the show "Seinfeld." Now he is in his late 50s, performing stand-up comedy, and is a huge racist apparently. Obviously until now, he was a closet racist, but just last weekend, he came sprinting out of that closet.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>In the same Newsweek I just posted about, there was another article about the internet in the 3rd dimension.</p>
<p>The article was specifically about Microsoft's 'Virtual Earth 3-D.' This is a site that is being developed currently, and is available but not complete (nor will it be for quite some time). Essentially, the site is similar to Google Earth, but seems more concerned with creating a video-game style landscape. This virtual world only consists of 15 cities at the moment, but they hope to add 100 cities by summer 2007. </p>
<p>There is no specific purpose for Virtual Earth 3-D other than it's really cool. Some people in class said that they liked the game Myst because they could just explore the beauty of the world. This technology offers that same possibility, except the world is OUR world, and the exploration can be for a better purpose than beating a game. In the magazine, they offer examples such as, if you can't remember the name of the bar you love in Baltimore, you can just go there, and read the sign on the front of the place. This also has the possibility of working as a Mapquest on steroids. Not only can it tell you where to turn, but you could actually SEE the turns as well as any landmarks that could help you. This means that the only excuses for getting lost ever again would be tehnophobia or stupidity. Im sure it will be many years before this technology encompasses the whole US, let alone the world. And it will be longer still until it is made to be user-friendly in practical ways, but still, i think this is pretty exciting.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I read an article in the latest Newsweek about the PS3. The article said, "The PS3's promise is to extend digital entertainment  into a realm so mesmerizing that your consciousness will be sucked into a virtual world, an experience enhanced by a shared participation with friends..." Isn't that what drugs are for? </p>
<p>To be honest, I'm not sure there's a lot of difference between gamers and drug addicts. </p>
<p>When there's been a lot of busts at the border, drug prices go up because they're harder to get.<br />
When Sony released 20,000 PS3s for all of  North America, many units were on e-bay for $1000 and higher only hours later. The 'Buy-It-Now' price for some of these things? $5500!</p>

That way, it would be a snap to recruit people to come play with us. Interested in Psychology? Oh, you're an everything studies major for sure! Sociology? Literature? Anthropology? Drugs? Sex?

    <div class="content"><p>This is mostly in response to the post about the videos of Lasse Gjertsen. I would just disagree with the first sentence that was said about 'Amateur.' I'm not sure it really brings up any questions of authorship. He is definitely the 'author' of that music. (I'm not sure though. when he starts playing the piano with the drums, that sounds so familiar. And too good, if you ask me. Someone should pay this guy to be doing something musically.)<br />
What most rap and hip-hop producers and artists do is very similar to what Lasse does. They mix different sounds and beats with computers. Lasse is just recording the video with the audio and creating more of a performance out of it.</p>

<p>this story is actually kinda about my grandma, so it works out really well. How? I don't know. But listen to what I have to say...</p>
<p>For the last 2 or 3 years, my grandma has bought me a subscription to Newsweek (which I read half of and skip over anything political because it's the SAME every week. Really, they should just put out one issue a year [I guess they'd have to start calling it Newsyear] and have one article that succinctly says, "It's all been pretty bad."). Anyways, just recently i got a hold of a few Rolling Stone magazines. The day after getting my hands on these babies I told ol' Grama to cancel Newsweek and get me some Rolling Stone. I figure at this point in my life (I'm 21[but my birthday's on Nov. 9th {gifts can be left in Pomona box #244, thanks.}]) I want to stop pretending I care more than I do about politics and most world issues.</p>
