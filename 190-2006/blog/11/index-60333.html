    <div class="content"><p>On page 197 of First Person, Henry Jenkins' online response says, "Contemporary film style is more elliptical and rapid-fire than the classical continuity system precisely because a generation that spends many hours per day consuming media demands cognitive challenges and perceptual puzzles rather than straightforward exposition."</p>
<p>I saw the Prestige last weekend, which may be a textbook example of this. in this film, the beginning is pretty much the same scene as the end. In between,  the film shifts back and forth between periods of time, and references made in the beginning are not made clear until the end, just as things that are told in the beginning change meanings throughout the film. This film could have been told as a straightforward linear narrative, but it wouldn't have been as interesting, for just the reason that Jenkins says. We are constantly consuming media everyday, and if the story is not going to be extremely original (which very few are) then the way in which it is told needs to be.</p>

<p>is the pages. They're too thin. I'm pretty sure these pages wouldn't actually pass as paper in a court of law. They're more like the cheap toilet paper they had at my high school. The pages' absurd thinness makes the book too flimsy, and awkward to hold. But the worst part about the thinness of pages is that if you are, for example, on page 135, you'd be feeling pretty good about yourself with most books. First Person is a different story. If you're on 135, you are only a quarter inch through this thing.</p>
<p>This book is inaffective because it discourages slow readers like myself.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Simon Penny's article "Representation, Enaction, and the Ethics of Simulation" had some points that really caught my attention. First of all, on page 77, the word phallocentric appears, which instantly validates the article. Phallocentricity, by the way, is climbing the ladder of my favorite words. It's in my top 8 for sure. </p>
<p>On page 77, Penny quotes David Grossman who says that kids are essentially practicing to kill with these videogames. Much like a flight simulator does for pilots, videogames teach children how to kill every target in their visual field. The most fascinating part of this was note #8 at the end of the article on page 83. Essentially, the point was that the kid who opened fire in a school in Paducah, Kentucky was an unusually good shot. He fired 8 shots, hitting 8 different children, 5 of which he hit in the head, and 3 of which he hit in the upper torso. They were trying to imply that because this kid played shooting videogames for hours each day that he was that much better of a shot. I disagree with this. While I do think it's a n interesting coincidence, a child's mastery of up, down, up, left, right, start is not going to help him pick up a 3 pound piece of steel and aim it with his eyes and steady his hands and squeeze a trigger 8 different times. One skill has nothing to do with the other.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm having a really hard time reading First Person. That's because I don't own it and Lindsay is being pretty stingy with letting me borrow hers. From what I have read, which is some mind you, I am pretty sure this book was written by videogame fanatics for other, equally academically inclined videogame fanatics. I have never been really into computer games since i broke the floppy for prince of persia, unless you count the first semester fo my freshman year when I played Snood to ease the pain. That being said, I understand how rapidly the market for computer games is growing I'm baffled by it, but I know that it's happening. Still, reading people's in depth analysis of computer games is a struggle for me. It could be that I'm being closed-minded and considering videogames to be low art. I mean, I have no problem listening to people discuss film or television at length. But when I'm reading these essays in First Person, all I can do is picture the "computer kids" from high school sitting in the cafeteria discussing this stuff, except now they're in their 20s and their awful beards are beginning to show signs of life.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I was thinking about this art/not-art debate. I actually really like McCloud's definition even thought I think it goes overboard. actually, over-broad. It encompasses too much, but in my opinion, it's better to call too many things art than not enough. Calling things aren't that weren't intended to be is fine, but telling someone who thinks they've created art that they actually haven't is communist.</p>
<p>I came up with a possible solution to this question. It harkens back to science class, which I did pretty well in. So follow this if you can:</p>
<p>Two of the types of energy are kinetic and potential. If a rock is rolling down a hill, that is kinetic energy. If that same rock is sitting at the top of a hill not moving, we say it has potential energy because of the energy that it could possess if prompted.</p>

<p>I didn't want to say this in class, but Thomas Kinkade is my uncle. Every Hannukah that I can remember, my parents, my cousins, Uncle Tom, and myself stay at a small cedar cabin near old Stony Creek. This cabin has been in our family for decades. When Uncle Tom's wife got pneumonia a few years back and had to stay for weeks in the hospital, my papa said we should sell the cabin to help Uncle Tom pay the bills. But Tom would have none of that. He painted to pay the bills. He insisted that the cabin and all the good times we've shared near Stony Creek meant too much to our family. We renamed the cabin in honor of the late Aunt Lois.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Starting to read House of Leaves I was real excited because so many people had said it was so fantastic. When I started reading it though, I found that I never really got immersed in the story. Perhaps my attention deficit was a little too disordered by the arrangement of text in this novel. I found it difficult to go back and forth from one narrator to the next, while literally thumbing backwards and forwards through the book. I also found Zampano's story of the Navidson Record to be supremely boring. I have a tough time believing that people actually get scared by this book. When they were measuring the house and finding it to be 5/16ths of an inch bigger on the inside, i was pretty much unaffected. Too much math, not enough blood to be scary.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Speaking of off the topic, let me waste 30 seconds of your time.</p>
<p>In my sculpture class last week, we were looking at some slides of some famous "art" pieces. We were looking at the work of some guy who's name i can't remember who chiseled these incredibly detailed marble sculptures. We were comparing this to the work of some other guy I can't remember whose sculptures were essentially just things he found that he modified slightly. For example, one of his pieces of "art" was a urinal that he painted some very small letters on, and set on its back.<br />
By taking an object that he did not create, and altering it ever so slightly, yet calling it his work, he is raising many questions of authorship. Is he still the "author" of this work, even though he didn't really create it? Does his style of "art" make him any less of an "artist" than the first guy who does something that people consider more legitimate.</p>

The whole dynamic of the group is young, stupid, white men doing things that only super-testosterone boys would do, and endangering themselves in the process. I say it's great.
