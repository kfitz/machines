    <div class="content"><p>well time is now running out on Wednesday, December  13th, and this will be my last blog entry for this course. I think there's a good chance that this will be my last blog ever.<br />
The experience of keeping a blog is one that I'm glad I had, but I didn't really take full advantage of it. This can really be a great outlet for thoughts and ideas, and thoughts, and other things that happen in brains. Mostly I looked at the blog as a chore throughout the semester, but it should have been more than that. This blog could have been the greatest blog in all the land. Fables could have been written about this blog. This blog could have been the stuff of legend.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So as I was watching the Colbert Report the other day, his guest was the guy who invented the Sims and came up with this new game, Spore. He was talking about the Sim games, and the more he talked about it, the less I liked the Sim games.<br />
He was talking and he was describing the reasons that people would want to play these games, they seemed pretty sick. For example, he said, if kids "had a bad home life" they could essentially "make a new life for themselves" Except in this game, the kids get to play God. Not bad son or daughter, like  usual.</p>
<p>I've never played these games, and I'm not really into computer games in general, but I don't see the fun in creating a world filled with robotic people and making them interact.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm was listening to Led Zeppelin and the song Ramble On came on. This made me want to blog. I'm gonna go ahead and blog about a class session we had a few weeks ago. It was the class where we were verbally presenting our theses. For people who weren't there, I will briefly recap. I was introducing my thesis, which is about "white trash." I put that in air quotes for reasons I will explain later.<br />
When I started my explanation, I was using the term "white trash" completely indiscriminately. Not that I was using the term with derision towards anybody, but I just thought that it was a term that was generally accepted in our society, and although I know it is an insult, it was never really used seriously where I am from.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>...the state of movie making these days, has anyone seen the trailer for the movie 300?</p>
<p>First of all, I'd just like to say that this movie looks like the most epic thing imaginable. The main  badass Spartan character is one of the most intimidating people I've ever seen. </p>
<p>But that's beside the point. The point is that the behind the scenes footage of this film looks like a tutorial video for green screening. In fact, it looks like, at no point in the filming of this movie did they ever step foot outside of a studio. Literally everything was green. This is what I was originally going to do my thesis on.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>On March 30th of next year, the film industry in this country hits a major crossroads. On that day, which will be either a particularly happy one, or a devastatingly sad one for me personally, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hits theaters. It is on that day, that America will decide once and for all if technology is a benefit to the film industry. </p>
<p>In this new installment of the Teenage Mutant Ninja saga, the movie is entirely digitally animated. I'm sure it's going to look OK, but the characters themselves are almost like superheroes in the way they move. Just judging from the trailer, they are jumping impossible distances, leaping from rooftop to rooftop and jumping from a building to the the street. I just think that the TMNT live action movies were unbeatable.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I had a thought while watching O Brother Where Art Thou?. It was about executions. I don't usually daydream about such horrific things, but sometimes I do. Anyways, O Brother takes place in a time when many executions were public. Not only were official executions public much of the time, there were often lynch mobs and other sorts of groups who would execute people in public. I wonder, if there was a public execution these days, on the 5Cs for example,  if anyone would watch it. Would it matter who the person was? If the execution was perceived by most people as justified. I started thinking about all this because of Saddam Hussein.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I was just a wee lad, I got a brand new Super Nintendo from Toys R Us. It was one of the happiest days of my life. Another one of the happiest days of my lives was when I got my nintendo 64. I remember hounding my parents for weeks leading up to Christmas whatever year that was. When I actually opened up that beautiful package, I was on top of the world. I can't really remember what year it was, but it was probably around 1995. Or so.<br />
But that's not important right now. What is important is that I have rediscovered my Super Nintendo. The most impressive part about some of the early super nintendo games is the fact that they can be so fun yet so crappy.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Well, I saw a movie last night, and I've got a few moments to spare, so I'd like to share my thoughts with all of you, my loyal minions. </p>
<p>The movie was Stranger Than Fiction. The actual story was very original. Actually, in a way, the story was not that original. It was along the lines of American Beauty or any story where a boring man miraculously changes his life, to give it more "meaning." The main character, a boringly predictable tax auditor was played by Will Ferrell in a role that most people would not recognize him in. Although, Will Ferrell does much more dramatic acting than people think, still when you see him in a role where he doesn't yell, not even once, it's surprising.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Since I'm sure no one is actually reading blog posts now that the semester is over, and most people are probably writing fervently to finish their blogs, I won't take much care with the words I use, grammar, speliing, or punctuation. I feel like I'm actually typing this for nobody, which is liberating.</p>
<p>Well, the other day,  was reading a Newsweeks article about the internet. Now, I don't know statistics, and I can't remember if the article addressed this issue specifically, but I'm just guessing that if it's not already a more lucrative medium than television, it surely will be one day. In fact, I bet in our lifetimes, all television is broadcast through some sort of an "internet" connection.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While listening to "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, I had yet another thought. At first I was perturbed, because because this most recent thought was my 12th in the day. I rarely have more than a dozen thoughts on any given day, and never on a Friday. But, I had it nonetheless, so I decided to hear myself out. My thought was about this recent battle between HD DVDs and Blue-Ray DVDs. In the next year or two, one of them will most likely win out as the "better technology." This is necessary, because the next generation of players will need to pick which format it would most like to "shake hands" with.</p>
