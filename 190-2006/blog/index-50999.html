    <div class="content"><p>I thought, since it's rather pertinent to what we're all doing here, that this would be interesting to share...</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my earlier post, being home is one of those glorious times that I get to catch up on the magazine reading I missed.  Now that I'm here, I've decided to start with the most recent issue of Time Magazine (as opposed to, say, Budget Travel, Sunset or, the guiltiest pleasure of them all, Coastal Living--Lord how I love reading about sea-side homes and the accessories that accompany them!) to maintain at least some semblance of intellectual integrity...</p>
<p>One of my favorite Time features is the Numbers bar, where two figures on one issue are presented side-by-side in such a way as to lead one to a certain realization of said subject.  Take this one on energy: "53%: Estimated increase in global demand for energy--mostly fossil fuels--by 2003.  Developing nations, primarily China and India, are responsible for that growth.  2010: Year China is projected to overtake hte US as the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I know that someone already posted about OJ Simpson's new/cancelled book "If I did it," but now that it has become a media uproar and book and interview have both been pulled, I think it warrants another post. According to todays LA Times article, "cries of censorship did not materialize in the protest." So I'm going to cry.. if only to play devil's advocate or something. </p>
<p>As disgusting and hurtful as the book's content is, I have to reference Voltaire (I think?). I disagree with what you say, but i will defend to my death your right to say it. I don't know if this adage will really extend to include a tell-all murder book, but it's an interesting question to ask ourselves. Is the book just offensive or truly hurtful/dangerous? OJ actually kind of seems to be arguing for his first amendment rights: "I think I'm legally muzzled at this point." So I guess I'm not the only one crying censorship.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I just watched the you tube video of Michael Richards (Kramer) from last Friday in LA.  He is really quite out of control.  I somehow don't really feel like this is going to end his comedy routine though. These comedians seemed to be easily forgiven because of the nature of their profession.  Clearly he comes off as being exceptionally racist here, but he also seems to be pushing the limits of what comedy routines often do.  That is, taking a specific group and making them the butt of a joke.<br />
This particular rant doesn't have the soft humor and sarcasm of racial jokes.  It is Michael, losing control fully exercising his racist demons. The content however could be near to the same, said in a different manner, and taken with a laugh.  This made me think about the boundary that comedians play on.   I think that some people blogged about this in relation to Borat.  (By the way my friends Grandma went to see this not knowing what it was and said to my friend, I quote, "I guess that is really what it is like in their country".)  Perhaps the Kazaki's do have reason for concern.  The Grandma's of the world are all going to pass judgment.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>While reading Free Culture, I was super interested in doujinshi, mentioned in the first chapter. These are comics that are essentially copies of other comics that are altered to make it the authors' own.<br />
I think I can see why an art form like this is great, and why it is negative. Of course, from a consumer standpoint, it is great. Allowing artists to be more free with 'borrowing' or whatever we call it will probably mean more content is produced. And if there is good ideas, it benefits the consumer to have many artists (possibly) copy them and expand on them.<br />
However, from the artists' standpoint, I can see how you wouldn't want other artist to use your ideas to make money that you probably could have made using your own intellectual properties.</p>

I noticed something interesting: apart from a worker at La Super-Rica Taqueria (a recommended stop on driving the Pacific Coast Highway, in case you were wondering), there were absolutely no people of color featured in the editorial content of the magazine.  None.</p>

<p>Toledano, an artist out of New York City has recently completed a series of photos taken of people playing video games. Being a huge gamer himself, Toledano said he had noticed that while people are playing video games, they display these extraordinary emotions and reactions that you don't normally see. In addition, some people exhibit these somewhat abnormal ticks when they become completely immersed in a video game.</p>
<p>As he so appropriately says on his website, "I wanted to take portraits of people that would reveal a hidden part of their character. So I had them play video games."</p>

Now he is in his late 50s, performing stand-up comedy, and is a huge racist apparently. Obviously until now, he was a closet racist, but just last weekend, he came sprinting out of that closet.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I think I really don't do this much in the blogspace, but I feel like ranting today. Maybe it's this meeting that i have today to try and convince Dean Clark to let me graduate a semester early (something I think should be a no brainer as long as all my credits/requirement/thesis are done). Maybe it's finals time or my trip to Vegas. Whatever, this little blurb of an editorial about a fairly trivial thing just set me off.</p>
<p>They're putting TVs in the LA transportation buses. Sounds fun, huh? like JetBlue TVs on transcontinental flights so you can watch crappy movies you wouldn't have payed to see otherwise but will secretly enjoy. But these ones will be on the entire time over speakers that will probably emit sound between volume levels of loud and ear-splitting. Plus, commercials.. lots of them. And targeted at the specific "bus riding demographic" (i.e. poor people without cars). I don't know about anyone else, but I actually love riding buses - it's a time to zen out on the slowly moving cityscape, or delve into a book, or people watch - but for the most part it is a silent activity (other than eavesdropping on close conversations and the occasional alcoholic/drug induced outburst). It's kind of like swimming or something - tune out if you want to. But now books and conversations and even outbursts will have to contend with bad credit advertisements and worthlessly summarized news broadcasts.</p>

<p>I am sure being the tuned-in, media-oriented students that so many of you are, you probably are already familiar with the blog TVNewser. If not, this is an interesting article about the kid who started it and the growing influence of the blog with in the television industry. </p>
<p>My favorite line from the article:<br />
"Perhaps this is what the techno-geeks had in mind when they invented the Internet -- a device to squash not only time and space, but also social class and professional hierarchies, putting an unprepossessing Maryland college student with several term papers due in a position to command the attention and grudging respect of some of society's most famous and powerful personalities."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In the same Newsweek I just posted about, there was another article about the internet in the 3rd dimension.</p>
<p>The article was specifically about Microsoft's 'Virtual Earth 3-D.' This is a site that is being developed currently, and is available but not complete (nor will it be for quite some time). Essentially, the site is similar to Google Earth, but seems more concerned with creating a video-game style landscape. This virtual world only consists of 15 cities at the moment, but they hope to add 100 cities by summer 2007. </p>
<p>There is no specific purpose for Virtual Earth 3-D other than it's really cool. Some people in class said that they liked the game Myst because they could just explore the beauty of the world. This technology offers that same possibility, except the world is OUR world, and the exploration can be for a better purpose than beating a game. In the magazine, they offer examples such as, if you can't remember the name of the bar you love in Baltimore, you can just go there, and read the sign on the front of the place. This also has the possibility of working as a Mapquest on steroids. Not only can it tell you where to turn, but you could actually SEE the turns as well as any landmarks that could help you. This means that the only excuses for getting lost ever again would be tehnophobia or stupidity. Im sure it will be many years before this technology encompasses the whole US, let alone the world. And it will be longer still until it is made to be user-friendly in practical ways, but still, i think this is pretty exciting.</p>
