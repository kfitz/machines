    <div class="content"><p>On a tangent completely unrelated to anything going on in my life, I've been wondering about privacy laws, particularly in regard to campus newspapers publishing untruths about students.  Are you allowed to print an article based on rumor using the name of someone who, although immensely popular, is not a celebrity?  Wouldn't you need at least one reliable source to print statements as fact, and isn't there some policy of "free until proven guilty" or "no defamation before J-Board trial"?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>K I wrote this one in my notebook and forgot to type it up, so I'm skipping way back to Hamlet on the Holodeck:</p>
<p>Chapter 10 of Murray's Hamlet on the Holodeck focused on the "kaleidoscopic world" that can be represented with new digital media, allowing audiences to choose which characters to follow among a variety of choices, and perhaps by a variety of authors.  Murray writes that this "can feel to some like an unauthored world," but I see it as a much more appropriate representation of the real world - in which we each have a unique vantage point, and can get closer or distance ourselves from the perspectives of others.  This "ability to capture experience as systems of interrelated actions" suggests that narratives will become more complex in the future, broadening the "good guy/bad guy" stance taken by many television shows and movies to expose the intimate perspectives and motives of each character - something the traditional television show or movie does not have the time to explore.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>man guys.  class tonight made me so depressed.  it wasn't the material or the presentation.  well maybe the material, but just because all my classes are pretty heavily theory-based these days and i can't figure out what theory is other than boring philosophy.  do people really make a living off these essays debating whether games have narrative elements, and do essays like the n0time business get in unedited because people seriously care about this stuff or because the editors decided to play a joke on pretentious academics?  call me crazy but i got to thinking in class that the devil had designed theory to keep our minds occupied so we miss all the real stuff around us.  kind of like the radio.  there is so much going on.  crazy turkmenbashi is trying to build an ice palace in the desert. a million japanese guys are playing video games for decades &amp; refusing to leave their rooms.  isn't tibet the only place in the world where polygamy is one female with multiple husbands?  dark matter is mindblowing &amp; the multiverse seriously problemitizes our definition of auteur. (why do we say auteur?  in grad school do you just say everything in french to sound smarter?)  &amp; why when i'm frustrated do i say "man guys"?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm glad someone mentioned in class that Murray gets creepy when she fantasizes about audience members providing "support" for characters on ER.  But Murray seems to have been right-on in calling that production companies would attempt to blur the lines between entertainment and reality.  She writes that as computer &amp; television become further intertwined, audiences will be able to access the virtual world of a television show, complete with remnants of the personal life of each character.</p>
<p>Earlier in this blog someone called attention to LonelyGirl15, three producers' attempt to build hype for a movie by introducing a main character as a real person through the vlogging world.  The idea initially seemed to have succeeded (15 million views), but I wonder whether audience members were turned off when they realized they had been duped.  LG15's followers thought they were comforting a legit human, while any crazeball comforting an ER patient has willingly suspended his/her disbelief.  I'm not sure if the LG15 movie is still happening, but if it is it will be interesting to see whether the hype has a negative or positive effect.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Building off my last blog, I'm starting to think that in every form of for-profit art or entertainment, the forces of creativity and fiscal marketing work directly against each other in today's society.  This might fit with our definition of art as "beyond the necessary," since we all work to bring home the bacon.  It's not always the case that a brilliant movie, novel, or musical composition will flop against competition created for the sole purpose of moneymaking, but it seems to me that companies are unwilling to take the risk of backing a new or unique project when they have already broiled the process of creating lucrative entertainment down to a simple equation.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Ghostwriter's blog about comic book adaptation reminded me of a talk I went to back at Tufts before I transferred.  Tufts is much more pre-professionally driven, and some 'successful' grad come back to tell us how to make it in show biz.  His entire speech centered around re-making the successful stories from the past, milking money out of them until no one ever wants to hear about the comic/fable/historical event again.  After listening for an hour about how revolutionary and trendy it is to copy old ideas, I've been noticing it everywhere.  Successful books become successful movies, every notable character from history is getting their own screenplay, and successful movies from the past are remade ad nauseam.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This is just to say props to Christy for pointing out in class that we have to decide what we want from a definition before we can all agree on one for "art."  It's funny that we started out this class talking about the subjectivity of meaning in words, and now we spend half an hour trying to pin down the universal meaning of "art."  Maybe I'm completely missing the point but I'm happy with defining art as creativity and leaving it at that.  Creativity meaning, basically, what Prof. Fitzpatrick threw out in class -- that which goes beyond the necessary.  Mario pointed out earlier that these types of debates are what we have adjectives for -- there's good art and bad art, but clearly a whole class of people is never going to agree what falls into each category.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I personally see it as a cop out when an author leaves an essential element of a story up to the reader in a way that makes it obvious there is no purpose to the mystery other than as a cheap device to grab an audience's attention (someone earlier mentioned the ending of Castaway).  But other authors intentionally leave elements open to interpretation in order to create a reality different from our day to day sensory experiences, and the intrigue builds from the new perspective and its implications (House of Leaves comes to mind).  McCloud describes this effect on pg. 133, writing, "...a lack of clarity can also foster greater participation by the reader and a sense of involvement which many writers and artists prefer."  The sense of living, rather than just observing, seems to make open-ended stories far more compelling.</p>

<p>Apathy is Domesticated Madness:<br />
Counterculture Arts as the Fuel of Activism</p>
<p>	Apathy, defined for the purpose of this exploration as indifference to one's surrounding society, is a concept closely associated with youth in many areas throughout the world.  Yet some of the most passionate and powerful movements in history have been spearheaded by youth, from the Civil Rights movement in the US to the Soweto riots in South Africa.  The foundations of these movements were not built from dry political debates that apathetic youth ignore, but rather from artistic protest: musical and theatrical demonstrations rejecting subordination and seeking justice.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Another possible thesis topic: Differences in artistic protest during the Vietnam War and the Iraq War in the US.  I hypothesize that during the Vietnam War, mainstream artistic protest dominated music, film, and theatre, while during the Iraq War, primarily underground outlets have created protest art, filling the void left by reluctant mainstream corporations.  I would investigate the changes in media technology and deregulation that might have led to this change, such as the increasingly low cost of video cameras and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (which should be familiar by now).</p>
<p>	Vietnam War documentaries such as the 1974 Academy Award winner "Hearts and Minds" were both controversial and popular, and as a result antiwar art proved an intelligent marketing decision for media distributors.  As Evan Medow, CEO of Windswept Pacific music publishing company, says, "At the time [of Vietnam], it was a moneymaking proposition to be involved with countercultural artists--Antiwar music was more the order of the day."  Today, he continues, "The music business is under attack on every conceivable level, with downloading and new technologies like streaming video and broadband--Record companies want to get control of their product. They're not going to take risks just for the sake of making a political statement. With things the way they are, you're not going to get the adventuresome thinking necessary to put out political music" (Rudman).</p>
