    <div class="content"><p>So of course, after posting about "Generation Y", I had to go look it up on wikipedia...  On the site they have a list of "major cultural events" that are associated with Generation Y, and I just thought I'd post it so that you guys can see if it seems accurate / enjoy it:</p>
<p>Popularity of The Transformers<br />
The Cabbage Patch Kids and Care Bear crazes of the early 1980s.<br />
The New Kids on the Block, Guns N' Roses, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer crazes of the late 1980s and early 1990s.<br />
The popularity of the Disney Afternoon shows in the early and mid 1990s.<br />
The popularity of the Ghostbusters media and merchandise in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Just thought I'd start this before running off to dinner...  I was in class today and the professor asked us if we were Generation Rx, a question that sparked basically the largest digression from discussion in the history of that class, and launched us into repeating every label our generation's encountered so far.  These included:</p>
<p>Generation Rx, apparently<br />
Generation Y, or "why?"<br />
Generation Me<br />
iGeneration<br />
MTV Generation<br />
Generation 9/11<br />
Echo Boomers</p>
<p>This is interesting to me for a couple reasons.  One, when do we become generationally situated?  Or how much time has to pass for one of these generational namesakes to stick?  We have Generation X before us, and the Baby Boomers before them-- those are pretty solidified.</p>

And by okay, I mean okay in that same way that some Gwen Stefani songs are okay: though you feel like you should know better, somehow these songwriters are able to engage that small "audio crack" receptor in the brain, and you can't stop listening to them no matter how hard you try  to go back to your usual playlists.</p>
<p>So yesterday, because I was so surprised at suddenly liking John Mayer again, I decided to go in search of more information--and where better to turn than www.johnmayer.com!  The site, as most artist sites now are, was a jumble of text, video, images and audio clips, and interestingly enough, a blog.  Obviously, I had explore.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last night, instead of finding a television to watch breaking election news, I stayed at my computer, checking back in to credible news sites to find out any updates.  This made me think back to the ways I used to find out breaking election news-- even sophomore year, during the Presidential election, I remember being with a ridiculous amount of people huddled around a dorm room television.  And I could've done this again I guess, if I'd wanted, but I think that something has changed in the way America and I do politics.  </p>
<p>There are many advantages to using the internet instead of the television to find out breaking election news.  For one thing, I didn't have to sit through some news anchor's meaningless drivel as he tried to fill up time between election projections.  I was also able to immediately access information regarding the exact races I was interested in finding out about, without having to sit through in-depth profiles of Nebraska's House candidates.  Most importantly, at least for me, I was able to multi-task throughout the whole night, keeping a handle on both my school work and the future of America!  Did anyone else find that this year they shifted to the internet from watching television for election coverage?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don't pretend to be hipster enough to know really anything about this, but isn't the type of remix that in the New Media article DJ Tim Simenon is talking about now called a mash-up?  Is that what we're calling it these days?</p>
<p>Anyhow, from what I've heard, mash-ups are kind of amazing and kind of rock my world.  They aren't much different from what Manovich is describing except instead of manipulating a single track with an anonymous extra beat or mixing around one artists' track and turning it into a more upbeat or slower version, mash-ups instead mix two tracks by usually very very different artists in ways that present the best of both tracks.  The first one I heard was on the radio this summer and it was Gnarls Barkley and the Raconteurs, a mash-up of "Crazy" and "Steady as she Goes" and named, appropriately, "Crazy as she Goes".  So I heard this and thought, you know, that this was just a crazy and kind of cool endeavor one DJ embarked upon until I discovered Girl Talk.  Girl Talk is a little bit different because he [yeah, it's just this one dude, crazy right], as Pitchfork so succintly put it, "crams six or eight or 14 or 20 songs into frenetic rows, slicing fragments off 1980s pop, Dirty South rap, booty bass, and grunge, among countless other genres. Then he pieces together the voracious music fan's dream: a hulking hyper-mix designed to make you dance, wear out predictable ideas, and defy hopeless record-reviewing".  Sooo it's a few more than two songs, but it's still equally incredible.  If you want to see a video of this man in action (who will also be in action next semester in Dom's Social Room!!!), check out <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/2006/9/11/Video_Girl_Talk_Empty_Bottle_090906#38460">this video</a>.</p>

<p>A dorky anecdote: In middle school I used to sneak on the internet after school to learn HTML and work on designing my tripod.com Nirvana fan site.  This was back in the day when turning a hyperlink red instead of nursery school-blue was a big deal, frames were hard to make, and text was presented in long, linear, unadorned chunks.  Little did I know my parents were still paying by the minute for our internet connection and when they caught on after a couple of months when our internet bill skyrocketed, I was internet-grounded.</p>

For my independent study in graphic design, I just finished reading Edward Tufte's "Envisioning Information", a very visual guide to the useful, constructive and aesthetic presentation of information.  The book has been really useful to me not only for my thesis but also in thinking about my own aesthetics.</p>
<p>In a lot of the design stuff I've done, I've used old graphs, timetables and diagrams not for the specific information they've contained, but for their visual worth.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Instead of annotated bibliographies, those of us doing new media projects are turning in "drafted project outlines elaborating on the project's structure".  Professor Fitzpatrick suggested that for my project, I use mind mapping software to lay out the structure of my thesis, which was pretty much suggesting that I reunite after a year with one of my favorite programs on Earth: Free Mind.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines a mind map as "an image-centered diagram that represents semantic or other connections between portions of information. By presenting these connections in a radial, non-linear graphical manner, it encourages a brainstorming approach to any given organizational task, eliminating the hurdle of initially establishing an intrinsically appropriate or relevant conceptual framework to work within".  Basically, picture the brainstorming with little bubbles that you did on paper in elementary school, but far more sophisticated, easily editable, and on the computer.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Just a quick note: in terms of intertextuality in new media, I think Lost presents one of the best and most thoroughly intriguing examples of a successful melding of medias.  Even within a single medium (television), Lost takes advantage of many of the developments Murray suggests are coming in future television-based media.  The show presents not only the storyline as it is taking place currently on the island, but also the back stories of different characters, switching between a few characters each episode, and changing character focuses every two to three.  I think this gives a far more complex (and ultimately more familar) notion of reality, and helps keep the show entertaining (so it isn't just a half hour of watching 25 people go "what the crap is going on??" every week).</p>

<p>My Mom got re-married this summer and, like all brides-to-be, it was pretty much all she could talk about.  Apparently, myself, my [now] stepdad and other friends and family weren't enough people to talk to, as she became really involved in a number of online wedding forums and posting boards as well.  For my stepdad and I, marriage gossip from these boards was actually in some ways welcome respite from my Mom's previous and equally vocal obsession with internet-based geneaology-- that's what we thought, anyway, until we realized that hearing about the wedding gown of "chrisandtara06" was not a whole lot more interesting than finding out "omgi'mrelatedtocharlemagne" was my great-great-great-step-twice-removed-uncle.  Nevertheless, my Mom was obsessed; I can even remember at least 3 times this summer that she mentioned, in passing, that she was up past 3 in the morning talking to other brides-to-be from around the country.</p>
