    <div class="content"><p>Having realized just how little downtime I'd been giving myself and the fact that I'd been neglecting my girlfriend horribly, I decided to do something I hadn't done in a long time, watch a movie.</p>
<p>We got <em>Imagine Me &amp; You</em> through Netflix, and I was skeptical. The Netflix description said:</p>
<p><cite>In this delightful romantic comedy that gives new meaning to the term cold feet , bride-to-be Rachel (Piper Perabo) is love-struck ... but not with her groom. Instead, as she's marching down the aisle with her longtime sweetheart, Heck (Matthew Goode), Rachel is immediately bewitched by a beautiful guest (Lena Headey). Now, the newlywed must choose between the safety of a familiar relationship and her heart's true desire.</cite></p>
<p>Not a lot in the description and I wasn't sure if it was going to be bad or <em>really</em> bad, but the girlfriend had put it on the queue so I figured we'd watch it.</p>
<p>It turned out to be pretty good, considering it was a romantic comedy (a genre I do not have the highest esteem for). It managed to avoid most, if not all, of the major pitfalls of any movie focused around a lesbian relationship. <strong>(warning spoilers below, if you actually think you'll ever watch the movie and don't want me to spoil the ending, stop reading now!)</strong></p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>i remember my first introduction to youtube was when i was abroad in france, and i found an article online talking about how the trailer for brokeback mountain was being reappropriated with many other films - and how the resulting videos ranged in success. there was one for point break, heat, and many others, including brokeback to the future (probably my favorite). this article mentioned how carefully viewers must have been to know these films, to be able to lift and recontruct a new meaning to some charged "homosocial" scenes between two men. and seeing the closer + star trek mashup, i was wondering about the motivation behind it. i feel like there are some intersections to be found, thinking in terms of vito russo's celluloid closet, and how there was a homosexual subtext in many films under the hays code - and that still continues in modern films. the representations of male buddies/companions still seems to be something that can't be explored fully on screen, so it's interesting to see how these heterosexual friendships are parodied into suggesting homosexual relations on youtube. who is the creator of things like this? what is her/his purpose? for some reason, i have this hunch that it's a teenage boy who's doing it for shits and giggles, but then i wonder who the target audience is? beyond the immediate group of friends said author is sharing these works with, on youtube it opens up accessibility, and then a major paper (i think it was the nyt) reports on it... i wonder what this new message is. i noticed the comments on youtube for the star trek video were mostly focused on how this was funny - but also creepy. and in class, we all laughed to see the funny new way that back to the future was presented to us -- but what is really being said in cases like this?, i oan't help but wonder.  and how come the ones i am familiar with usually involved suggesting male homosexual undertones made overt?</p>

    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li  class="first last taxonomy_term_452"><a href="../taxonomy/term/452/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_452">facebook</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I was resistant against Facebook at first, I still am slightly, but I am getting over it.  I feel like social networking is there for you to engage with it at any level.  That is what is great about it.  Either you can turn it into a major source of communication, one that you rely on for social interaction (of some form) ,or you can just put up a profile and check it once every two months when really you just want to stalk someone.<br />
I did however witness an instance this week in which I saw proof of the benefits of social networking in terms of making ones academic life easier through quick and easy access to friends.  I am in a research methods class for Psychology and we have to conduct these surveys. It is really about all we do in that class.  So I put my big'ol survey together and was like, "cool, now I just have to go give it out".  Right yeah, that took forever, I was sweating by the end of my three hour jaunt to get like 50 survey's filled out.  So anyways, I talk with my friend Sean, and he says, "oh I just put my survey on line and sent out an invite on facebook".  He had around100 responses after just two hours of it being up.  Imagine that, life made easy by a computer.  I think that something like that shows the benefits of having social networks like facebook.  By just sending the survey out to all of his networked friends he was both being less invasive than I was going door to door and getting more responses.  I can see how this type of access could be helpful on many academic and professional levels.  So perhaps while facebook might be hindering some scantily clad drunkard users from getting jobs, I think it has the potential to be helpful in many other respects.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The Manovich article starts out talking about the work space which Razorfish embodies. He says of the office, "The design of the space functions as a metaphor for computer culture's themes; interactivity, lack of hierarchy, modularity." This made me think as I have always had an interest in design, especially that of a-typical work spaces.    Weird thing to have an interest in, I know, but I swear it is true.  It has caught my eye ever since I walked into the office of a financial planner which had been designed by one of the guys on Queer Eye for the Strait Guy.  This office was somewhat similar to the described Razorfish office.  The owner of this company explained to me that the space was about having intimacy in the work place when computers are driving us to a point of isolation.  Again in this office there was no semblance of a hierarchy and no closed doors.  Everything that was happening in this office was in plain view to all who entered the space.  Again this summer at my work I encountered another interesting design.  Again it was relitivly open, but did have offices along the walls.  Each of these offices however had glass walls so you could see everything going on within them.  At first I felt like I would never have a moment of privacy in the office.  This was true, other than the bathroom of course (which I might add was co-ed, something I never fully embraced).  Again it the space was about television.  The office was designed to give of a young hip, modern feel and leave space for communication to occur.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>On a tangent completely unrelated to anything going on in my life, I've been wondering about privacy laws, particularly in regard to campus newspapers publishing untruths about students.  Are you allowed to print an article based on rumor using the name of someone who, although immensely popular, is not a celebrity?  Wouldn't you need at least one reliable source to print statements as fact, and isn't there some policy of "free until proven guilty" or "no defamation before J-Board trial"?</p>

If any of you know, they range is O,B,A,F,G,K,M,L,T arranged from hottest (blue) to coldest (red) and then L and T arenor really stars but are recent additions to the spectral classification. </p>
<p>ANYWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. I was informed by the chatty text that our Sun is classified as a G star. Specificallya G-2 star.And then I remembered that clothing company, G-Star RAW that the european guys wear and I thought that there had to be a connection with the name of the clothing company and astronomy. And so I thought, how smart. Its always nice to see a smart or witty company or name of something in contrast to the bland names most things seem to have. SO I decided to take a look at the compant website to see a bio for the company to see if I was right regarding the name connection. (Found at http://www.g-star.com/flash/content.html)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last night, instead of finding a television to watch breaking election news, I stayed at my computer, checking back in to credible news sites to find out any updates.  This made me think back to the ways I used to find out breaking election news-- even sophomore year, during the Presidential election, I remember being with a ridiculous amount of people huddled around a dorm room television.  And I could've done this again I guess, if I'd wanted, but I think that something has changed in the way America and I do politics.  </p>
<p>There are many advantages to using the internet instead of the television to find out breaking election news.  For one thing, I didn't have to sit through some news anchor's meaningless drivel as he tried to fill up time between election projections.  I was also able to immediately access information regarding the exact races I was interested in finding out about, without having to sit through in-depth profiles of Nebraska's House candidates.  Most importantly, at least for me, I was able to multi-task throughout the whole night, keeping a handle on both my school work and the future of America!  Did anyone else find that this year they shifted to the internet from watching television for election coverage?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Relating Manovich to social networks part two--.<br />
Manovich contends that "all authorship that uses electronic and computer tools is a collaboration between the author and these tools that make possible certain creative operations and certain ways of thinking while discouraging others. Of course humans have designed these tools, so it would be more precise to say that the author who uses electronic/ software tools engages in a dialog with the software designers (see #4)."<br />
I certainly had never thought of collaboration in these terms. I do have to say that to an extent, I agree with this point, especially in social networking collaborations/interactions. This would make sens then with what I discussed previously in part of one relating Manovich to Social Networks. This point of view provides the user with looking at social networks not only as a network created solely on user interactivity. But taking it a step further and considering that by using a site interface, and limiting your identity and thus connections, a person is interacting with the makers of the site. In other words, the designers made the rules/interface + you as user follow them (or not, after all you have a choice to abide or subvert them)= an interaction of people through software (the digital social network.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Manovich discusses how "collaboration over the network to create new media is the most visible example of a more general phenomenon." He says "new media culture brings with it-- new models of authorship which all involve different forms of collaboration." </p>
<p>With respect to the digital social network, I believe that interactivity as collaboration in this case is indeed an example of how new technologies afford users a new form of authorship that in term results in new forms of interpersonal connections. I believe that in the network, miscommunication is avoided by limiting the identity that the users are able to create online. Networking sites limit the extent and forms of identity by designing their site interface in specific ways. In this way, sites themselves are assured that they will attract users and be able to maintain them by providing a medium "real" enough, yet not TOO real, in which users have some sort of liberty to make certain connections. In this way, the limitation is a factor in the creation of the version of the individual, or identity presented. This ensures that the success (in terms of maximized interactivity, and therefore, connections forged through the network) of the users' online identity will be maximized. Of course, this "success" will be still be limited in terms of what kind of audience the users are attempting to attract. Nonetheless, as Manovich says, the comprehensions of the narrative, in this case the user, will be improved.</p>
