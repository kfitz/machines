<p>David edaris<br />
Hearing his coming out story, his actual life experience told as he wants it.</p>
<p>Different moments of humor</p>
<p>The power of 'confessional' lyric writing vs. hearing it performed aloud</p>
<p>Experiences are more vivid?</p>
<p>References another writer, Susan Sheehan, shocked to find no one has read her work</p>
<p>Bar run by midgets in Manilla, then "sells" Tokyo</p>
<p>Proudest to be published in New Yorker, will leave the table of contents open and walk by and look at it in pleasant surprise.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In light of the Borat movie release this weekend, I would like to discuss Ali G (Baron Cohen) and his other fun filled characters. Wine, I like.  I read this article where the author was trying to sound self-important because she had experienced a moment in which she was able to speak with Baron Cohen himself, (out of character).  Apparently this is rare.  The article talked about how he keeps up his character face in any interview even in light of the political issues that have been brought up surrounding the Borat movie. He still responds as Borat.<br />
      Another reporter in the article was making the argument that when reporters speak to him in character they are not fully doing their job, that of seeking information.  What they are doing is further promoting his act.  They are simply being another venue in which Borat is gaining popularity instead of getting at the real issues of who Baron Cohen is and why he is doing this.  We don't really ever get to know what he thinks about the fact that his Borat My Space page says he lives "three mile north of fence to jewtown". I think this is of course fitting because he is in the genre of comedy, the moment he makes commentary, it becomes a little to serious.  But it is true that they are never going to get a real answer out of him, from the point of view of what the artist thinks of his creation if he is always talking as the man from Kzakhstan.  Perhaps Barbara Walters could get a compelling interview out of him.  Make him squeeze out a few tears?! It could happen.  Or Opera?  She might be able to do it.  Here are some fun controversy facts I found on the Wik:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've been meaning to blog about this for a while now, but life just keeps getting in the way. Really who would have thought that blogging would be so hard? So constraining? You would think it would be one of the easiest, most liberating parts of class. No dice. Huh--</p>
<p>Anyway, this post is not about blogging, despite outward appearances, it's about TV. I've been getting DVDs of television series on my Netflix lately because I discovered that I almost never have two hours of consecutive free time in which to watch a movie any more. Lately I've been watching <em>Samurai Jack</em>, the Cartoon Network animated series. I don't know how many of you have seen it. If you've only seen one or two episodes, you probably don't have all that high opinion of it and I can't say I blame you, but watched as a whole it's pretty damn cool and I'll tell you why!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>... and it's only november 2! i just had to sprint back from a social gathering, realizing it was nearly midnight and i had forgotten to post today. this should be an interesting month...</p>
<p>while my thoughts are still scattered and under-developed, i would like to look into my notes on two authors who have recently spoke here at the 5-cs. tonight i heard amy tan, and a few days ago i heard david sedaris - and each time, i was hit with little lightbulbs of inspiration when i realized i was witnessing my notions of authorship shift. reading an author's work is drastically changed once you hear (and see) said author live, even more so when you hear them read their own work in their voice.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When it comes to First Person, I think it's interesting to discuss the structure of the book, even more so than the content... although in both structure and content, it's unlike any piece of literature I've ever read before.  (Yeah, you can argue that House of Leaves is hypertextual in the same way, but that was fiction, and this is theory...)  I've never seen an anthology in which another theorist responds to each individual essay, then the author of the original essay responds back, etc.  As a result it feels more like a Web forum (albeit one full of extremely smart people) than a piece of literature, which is really cool (especially considering the subject matter).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last night, while watching South Park, I saw a preview for a new video game (for PlayStation 2) called "Bully."  It looks like Harry Potter without the magic, and I just could not figure out for the life of me what the point of the game was.  The preview centered on "the new kid" as he met people at Bullworth Academy (the jocks, the nerds, the bullies, the hot girls, etc.) and I'm assuming he takes up the "stop bulling the nerds" cause.  In any case, I found this interesting primarily because of the article in First Person titled "Videogames of the Oppressed" which advocated for a computer/video game based on the techniques used in "Theater of the Oppressed."  Basically, the game/performance involves a lot of audience interaction and actors work "undercover" in the "Forum Theater."  Frasca writes, "Forums are created around a short play (5-10 minutes long), usually scripted on-site, and based on the suggestions of the participants.  The scene always enacts an oppressive situation, where the protagonist has to deal with powerful characters that do not let her achieve her goals...The scene is enacted without showing a solution to the problem.  After one representation, anybody in the audience can take over the role of the protagonist and suggest, through her acting, a solution that she thinks would break the oppression" (88- whew!).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I'm posting this primarily because I love South Park (as I know you are aware from my previous post), but I rushed back to my dorm last night to catch the new South Park episode and, by some miracle, it was about computer games again!  Specifically, the Nintendo Wii, which I find pretty cool, and which Cartman falls in love with.  We talked a bit about it last night, and I'm pretty curious to see how this will affect video gaming/how realistic video games become (as someone said last night, "Great, kids will be even better at shooting guns").  </p>

    <div class="content"><p>I just got my take home mid-term for my other media studies class and I had to share it with you.  The first half of the mid-term is pretty typical. Upon selecting a scene from a current TV show, you have to write a 2-3 page essay imagining what it would be like if you were seeing that scene 40 years ago and what would be controversial or groundbreaking about it. </p>
<p>The second half of the mid-term is a little more interesting. We have to watch a solid hour of TV and write down every ad that we see during the commercial breaks while taking brief notes about what the ad is selling, who is represented in the ad etc. Then we have to organize this list of ads into groups based on the product i.e. beer, cars etc. and then we have to organize the list into  subgroups based on what is being represented in the ad and who is the target audience.</p>

<p>This is just a small blog to rejoyce in the fact that instead of learning about the constitution, supply and demand, or memorizing the periodic table of elements, I am watching "hologrinding" in a galaxy far, far, away. Man, isn't Media Studies just the shit sometimes?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>man guys.  class tonight made me so depressed.  it wasn't the material or the presentation.  well maybe the material, but just because all my classes are pretty heavily theory-based these days and i can't figure out what theory is other than boring philosophy.  do people really make a living off these essays debating whether games have narrative elements, and do essays like the n0time business get in unedited because people seriously care about this stuff or because the editors decided to play a joke on pretentious academics?  call me crazy but i got to thinking in class that the devil had designed theory to keep our minds occupied so we miss all the real stuff around us.  kind of like the radio.  there is so much going on.  crazy turkmenbashi is trying to build an ice palace in the desert. a million japanese guys are playing video games for decades &amp; refusing to leave their rooms.  isn't tibet the only place in the world where polygamy is one female with multiple husbands?  dark matter is mindblowing &amp; the multiverse seriously problemitizes our definition of auteur. (why do we say auteur?  in grad school do you just say everything in french to sound smarter?)  &amp; why when i'm frustrated do i say "man guys"?</p>
