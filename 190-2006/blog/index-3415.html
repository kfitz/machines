    <div class="content"><p>i really liked "understanding comics". it touched upon several major media studies topics that we've gone over during our academic careers, but in a very readable and enjoyable format. from the use of icons to represent ideas, to the high art vs. low art debates of what does get to constitute art, to the more recent house of leaves inspired discussions on form's relationship with content.</p>
<p>one aspect of the book that really fascinated me was the comparisons between western comics and japanese comics. Even though the same format is used, and there is a similar relationship between icon and representation, what those icons, and what modes of visual storytelling that are considered natural, are are completely different. It amazed me how unique they were from each other. This made me wonder how would this class be like if we were in another culture where the notions of narrative, and possibley even the notions of the role of author are completely different?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was watching tv with my friend who is one of those obsessive channel changers.  I mean, this is borderline put this compulsive behavior into a book for diagnosis.  He changes the channels I would say on average, every 2 minutes.  So, I am sitting there trying to watch with him some Sports Center show, then some TBS movie, than a crappy MTV game show, then -- With every switch of the channel I get sucked into the next show. I want to see if the man can break the record for largest pizza dough ever tossed, but alas there is the click and we move on in television world.  </p>
<p>This is frustrating yes, but when one is in the middle of reading Understanding Comics it at least has the interesting aspect of being able to relate this to closure.  The television is like a world of its own where channels are constantly broadcasting giving the shows life.  If I am not watching a particular show however, I don't think about it's possibility as an existing form of entertainment for me.  When the channel gets changed and I don't get to learn if the bomb ever went off, it ceases to exist for me.  I can still perceive the whole though, because I am made aware of the fact that the show is going to come to some sort of a conclusion.  It is my experience with television that tells me something more must be there even when no longer focusing on the reality of the show.  So, this is what I was thinking about as my friend changed the channels.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, so I'm still thinking about narration, and now I have some more questions/thoughts about non-narrative forms.  I was in Las Vegas this weekend and my friends and I went to see Le Reve (the dream), an acrobatic, Cirque du Soleil type show.  The show didn't make any linear, narrative-type sense as I suppose the audience had been warned about in the title...  But I wonder, what effect does providing that kind of a background as a prelude offer to a production?  Or a better question I guess, what kind of license does an author get when advising that a creation is dream-based (or simply non-narrative based)?  Would most audiences be less willing to drop their attachment to narrative theatre or spectacula without prior explicit warning of the possiblity?  It's kind of interesting that we bring out previous conceptions of where we expect narrative to appear and where we don't to the table when consuming media...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I read this quote "If who I am matters LESS, maybe what I SAY will matter MORE."  I thought, well I suppose this is why we are reading understanding comics in a authorship class.  The idea of identification through simplification and generalization makes sense, I had just never thought of it before.  It is interesting however, that this doesn't directly apply to other forms of representation.  </p>
<p>In a fictional book for example, we do not want the main character to be simplified to the point where we identify with them.  On the contrary we want explicit details in order to gain a better understanding of their complex inner workings.  I think we need this to make them real, so that we are no longer fully reading them as a character, but rather as a person. We find identity though other means, by their feelings emotions, actions est.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So in the last HOUR that it took me to read all the latest blog posts, I was reminded of an authorship discussion I had recently in another class of mine. In my creative journalism class we had a brief discussion about ghostwriting. Though I'm sure most if not all of you know, a ghostwriter as defined by Wikipedia, "is a writer who writes under someone else's name, with their consent. Ghostwriters are often employed by celebrities to write autobiographies in situations in which the celebrities themselves may not be talented writers, or are too busy doing other work.  Many politicians also employ at least one ghostwriter to compose letters for them."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was reading the latest installment of <em>Kyle's Bed &amp; Breakfast</em> online (which the comic artist describes as "the world's favorite comic strip about a gay bed &amp; breakfast") and it got me thinking about how the prevalence of webcomics, and the role of the internet and new media in the production and consumption of comics. Making comics on the web seems to have a lot of advantages: it's cheaper for the reader and can offer more control for the artist (possibility of more independent comics getting out there, animating images). </p>
<p>At the same time, I wonder about the drawbacks of a web/computer format. Over the summer I wanted re-read Neil Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em> series (which is great, btw), but I didn't really have the cash to spend $20+ on the books in the series I'm missing. So I ended up downloading the series online and reading the first few books in print and the rest on my computer. It was still a good read, but something was missing. One of the things McCloud talked about was color, and that may have been a factor, the differences between the color you see on your computer screen and the color that a printer can print. Another thing may have been reading strategy. In my Digital Art class, we talked about the idea that people tend to read things on the computer differently than the way they read books and other printed media. Reading on the web and the computer tends to be faster, more of a skimming for information. I definitely found myself getting caught up in that when I was reading <em>Sandman</em>.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This book was tremendous fun.  Over the summer I had an internship at G4's ATTACK OF THE SHOW, a Nerdfest of geeky proportions.   I loved it.  One of the many menial tasks I had to perform was scanning comics into the system for "Fresh Ink", a segment that features comic books.  Although it would often take me more than an hour to scan in the damndirty pages, I really enjoyed reading the comics.  Most were in color and very detailed--lots of action lines, blurs, blood, angry faces, etc.    I read a great one where these evil guys kill Santa Clause's reindeer...so Santa Clause takes BLOODY REVENGE!!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Scott McCloud makes an examination of cartooning as a "form of amplification through simplification." He explains, "When we abstract an image through cartooning, we're not so much eliminating details as we are focusing on specific details. By stripping down an image to its essential "meaning," an artist can amplify that meaning in a way that realistic art can't" (30). I like how he states "amplification through simplification" as a way of "amplifying meaning in a way that realistic art can't". I saw a really good example of this in these stick figure post cards that are sold at Pomona's Coop store that play with simple lines and circles to make fun at the expense of real physical life of curves.  These stick figure post cards clearly was "stripping down an image to its essential 'meaning'" in order to present the joke in an "amplified" way which realistic art might have a harder time achieving.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm finding Scott McCloud's breakdown of comics really interesting; I guess I've been thinking a lot lately about narrative-less productions of sequenced art (since Man with a Movie Camera, maybe?), and how they force the imagination to fill in the blanks...  </p>
<p>I'm really interested in the function of "gutter space", how the division of panels affects the creation of the book for the reader.  I wonder, and I think that McCloud supports this, if a piece of the satisfaction of consuming comics is this bit of agency we receive in the process, the ability to create the scene according to our own desires.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>i found myself paying more attention to the text's format in mccloud's book than the pix in order to understand his points. in chapter 2, he spent so much time with that pyramid, with its 3 points: realistic image, meaning through words, and artistic abstraction. in considering my own preference, i think i like jack kirby's style: "a middle ground of iconic forms with a sense of the real about them, bolstered by a powerful [text] design sense" (55). his images were simple enough to maintain the focus on the action, but detailed enough to give some personality to the characters. and his words, which really are the primary thing that at least i look to first, definitely have a personality of their own.</p>
