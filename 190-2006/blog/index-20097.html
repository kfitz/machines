    <div class="content"><p>So today (10/09) we watched Man with A movie Camera in another class of mine. </p>
<p>Watching it a second time after having our class discussion really allowed for me to focus more in depth in what the movie was about. </p>
<p>Anyhow, before the movie began, my film professor mentioned that the soundtrack on the movie (the same one we listened to in our video in class) is indeed the original one that Vertov himself comisisoned to go with his movie. He wanted the music to accompany the pace of his movie. This was Vertov;s way of creating a musical ballet mechanique, or musical montage of the moving elements in his film. After watching it a second time, I was convinced that the sound in this film is of equal or greater value than the visuals because a great sound can make up for a mediocre visual. Not to mention that the way that the music was juxtaposed to the filmic action really did affect how I perceived the film. It really did, along with the changing speed of the film, make my emotions come and go in waves. Watching this film in silence  would be like watching the stabbing scene in Hitcock's Psycho minus the music--. The result would be "eh--" Music and film speed by create a unique rhythm together that Vertoov as author really took advantage of.</p>

<p>"In 1990 in The New York Times, Andy Grundberg wrote: 'In the future, readers of newspapers and magazines will probably view news pictures more as illustrations than as reportage, since they will be well aware that they can no longer distinguish between a genuine image and one that has been manipulated.  Even if news photographers and editors resist the temptations of electronic manipulation, as they are likely to do, the credibility of all reproduced images will be diminished by a climate of reduced expectations.  In short, photographs will not seem as real as they one did.'</p>

At last count she had of 1.4 million friends and a total of 45 million views making her the most popular person on MySpace. For these oh-so fine accomplishments she has earned herself an interview on MSNBC, graced the cover of Stuff magazine, launched a clothing line, been offered a book proposal and she is now a rising hip-hop star with several of her songs topping the unsigned acts charts on MySpace.

    <div class="content"><p>Godard quoting Brecht: "All art is plagarism." He might be exaggerating a bit but, I think the best one-liners usually do that.<br />
So, the first thing that came to mind when reading House of Leaves (HoL) was the fake/real movie aspect of it. Straight away, it made me think of the Blair Witch Project. I'm sure some of you thought the same. Especially with the whole monster-you-never-see device playing a huge role in The Navidson Record.   </p>
<p>I can't really take the "plagarism" stand for much more of the book because it is so unique. Given, I am not the most well-read person but I have never flipped so much from one part of a book to another since I read a Choose Your Own Adventure book back in the day. I mean, thats the post-modern condition isn't it? everythings been said, painted, presented, photographed, projected already. Take what you got and get your bricolage on. Danielewski definately did.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I wish there was more of a clear cut path as to what I am meant to do in applying for media type jobs.  All of my friends who are in the process of applying for consulting jobs have such an advantage in that the school caters to their needs.  If applying to a job I was interested in meant following a specific predetermined formulaic process I wouldn't have so much pent up anxiety about the fact that it is senior year and the impending graduation is approaching.<br />
I want to look for work in children's television and perhaps in advertising but it is just a little disheartening to be surrounded by friends who are perusing more predictable paths.  I.E. they know what they  want to do next year, could tell me their starting salary, and could predict an average day. A lot of my finance friends already have job offers and they had an internship last summer which showed them exactly what working for their company will be like.  I feel like my internship in television didn't really provide me with the best picture of what salaried work would be like.  It got me into the environment, but my tasks were very intern specific.  I am sitting here going well likely if I pursue children's television I will start out as a PA, get frustrated and disillusioned and wind up back in gradschool to pend the inevitable second attempt at trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.  Has anyone found a way of getting around this feeling of uncertainty as to how to proceed about media job searches.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Was going to include this in my last post, but I think it deserves a post on its own...</p>
<p>In thinking about new forms of classic media (such as House of Leaves (I would argue) and the Spore game I just blogged about, Brian Eno as quoted), I've been beginning to see the changes in authorship patterns.  Namely, I've noticed a trend in an author's willingness or openness to allow their work to be consumed and interpreted in ways that they can't predict.  In House of Leaves, it's up to the reader to choose which footnotes to read, what appendices to pay attention to, how much to invest, providing infinite opportunities to delve into the text.  In Spore, Will Wright has set up an environment that, instead of placing or installing a narrative or linear, predictable progression, gives literally all of the control to the consumer.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>There's a new computer game coming out called "Spore", created by Will Wright (the guy that created Sim City, The Sims, etc).  Essentially, in the game, you begin with a spore that you control, whose necessities you take care of just like in The Sims...  and evolve and as you evolve, you get to choose what changes are made to your creature: will you put a spike on their forehead so predators don't bite their heads off?  how about adding more tails to help them keep their balance?  And so the game goes, and you continue to evolve, until you become a creature that begins to build a tribe, then a civilization, then a globalized world...  and then you start trying to take over the rest of the universe.</p>
