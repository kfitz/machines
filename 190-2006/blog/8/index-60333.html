    <div class="content"><p>Yay, I did some revision on my thesis proposal, which for me meant adding more specifics about my methodolgy and the like. Here's the new stuff:</p>
<p>I have chosen to focus my thesis on one particular online community, Afropunk.com, which is one of the largest and well-known of these communities. Afropunk.com originally started as website promoting James Spooner's (find the year) documentary, "Afropunk". It has since spawned an online community of nearly 3000 members and also hosts events in the real world. Although the website uses the term "Afropunk" specifically, community members are into various rock scenes. Like "punk", the term "Afropunk" is more about one's attitude or approach.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was already interested in our discussion on external memory/externalized sources of knowledge. Then I went to my Digital Art class yesterday and exploring this was a huge part of our lecture. It's funny how classes can overlap like that. </p>
<p>One of the things we talked about that was most interesting to me was the "memory theatre". Basically (and I'm sure I'm over-simplifying and leaving something out), the memory theatre was the brainchild of Giulio Camillo back in the sixteenth century. The concept is that, a person is standing on a stage, surrounded by seven different columns and rows, which are organized astrologically, based on the planets and their qualities and characteristics. These rows and columns would contain all the known knowledge in the universe.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, in section four of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray says:</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, the Internet is beginning to function as an alternate broadcasting system-- as television channels and the World Wide Web come closer together, the telephone, computer, and cable industries are racing to deliver the new digital content to the end user faster and in greater quantities"(253).</p>
<p>I think that we're definitely seeing the ways in which the Internet is influencing TV. I find that nearly all of my TV watching is on my computer and is facilitated by the internet, even when I'm at home for holidays and have more access to actual TV. While most TV on the internet is provided by users (such as the person who puts the latest episodes of <em>America's Next Top Model</em> on YouTube. Thank you, whoever you are--), the TV broadcasting companies are getting in on the TV on the internet train too. Aside from iTunes, which has deals with several networks to sell episodes in the iTunes Music Store, some networks have their shows available for free on their websites. Two examples would be abc.com and the-n.com. ABC uses the tagline "Watch tonight on TV, watch tomorrow online". The-N has a section of their website called "The Click" where viewers can watch full episodes of shows, as well as previews for upcoming shows, and "webisodes"(which are kind of like the gutter space between episodes). Although there are still commercials, there are far less than on real TV and they tend to be only at the beginning of the episode. It will be interesting to see if more companies follow suit, and what effect the corporate presence (and copyright laws) will have on the more user dominated forms.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>One of the things that really interested me in <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> was Murray's discussion of fan-fiction. Although fan-fiction exists in many forms, I think that now we're seeing more and more fan videos, and with the widespread use of YouTube, these are becoming more accessible to viewers. For example, from Harry Potter, to Batman, to Saved by the Bell, there's a plethora of gay slash fan videos on YouTube. </p>
<p>Fan-fiction tends to remain in its own bubble, generally either ignored or hated by the companies that produced the original texts (or in the case of Anne Rice, banned. What a bitch.). But in the past couple of years, there have been two incidents where fan videos have actually influenced film production. The first one is <em>X3: The Last Stand</em>. Towards the end of the film, during a confrontation with Shadowcat, Juggernaut says to her, "Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut bitch!". The line is taken from a fan video made by using footage from the early-mid-90s X-men cartoon with blaxploitation style voice-overs. The second example of course would be <em>Snakes on a Plane</em>, whose famous line comes from a fan video and wasn't origninally in the film. The popularity of the catchphrase online led to the studio to shoot more footage and add it into the film.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>On page 38 of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray states that, "to be alive in the twentieth century is to be aware of the alternative possible selves, of alternative possible worlds, and of the limitless intersecting stories of the actual world." </p>
<p>This quote reminded me of an improv show I went to on Sunday night. Three of the skits/games in particular stood out. The first one was a game in which there are two different two-person scenes going on, one being frozen while the other is in action. After awhile, the active scene stops and the frozen scene starts up again, using the last line from the formerly active scene (did that make sense?). Although that line remains the same in both scenes, both scenes were entirely different and used it in different ways. Game two was called "new choice" in which two people act out a scene, while the host periodically says "new choice", forcing them to go back and change the line they just said. This in effect changes the course of the scene, leaving the audience to follow the new direction while still wondering how the scene would have played out if the original line had been kept. The third game was one in which two people are acting out a scene until they are forced to freeze. While they're frozen, another person must step in and replace one of the actors in the scene, putting their body into the same position as the person they replaced. It was interesting to see how much the addition of this new person could change the scene. Although the actors were positioned in the same way, the meaning of that positioning totally shifted. Though <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> discusses this kind of narrative in new media forms, it was interesting to me to see them played out in a theater format.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In Chapter 2 of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray discusses how new narrative formats are being developed along with new electronic technology. Beginning on page 51, she explores the narrative potential of video games. Although games have "more detailed visual environments and faster response time-- the narrative content of these games is thin, and is often imported from other media or supplied by sketchy and stereotypical characters" (Murray 51). While it's clear that we still have our share of games with thin narratives, or narratives based on stereotypical characters ("Grand Theft Auto San Andreas" comes to mind), I think that narratives in games have changed a lot since Murray wrote this in 1997.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, this is the last thing I'm going to post about comics, I promise. So anyway, over the past 5 years or so, we've seen a rash of comic book film adaptation being produced by major Hollywood studios. Most of them have been superhero related (i.e. <em>Superman Returns, Batman Begins</em>, and the <em>X-men</em> series), but other comics have been adapted as well (i.e. <em>Ghost World, V for Vendetta</em>). So I was thinking about why in this historical moment are comic book adaptations all the rage, and also, what makes a good adaptation? </p>
<p>As for the first question, I'm not really sure. In the case of more superhero oriented movies, perhaps it's like a relatively safe way to capitalize on the action movie market. Characters like Batman and Spiderman have been around for a long time and have established a strong fanbase. Most fans will go see the movies at least once, whether the adaptation is good or not, and the name recognition and hype may be enough to get non-fans into the theaters.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was reading about the comics industry online when I came across an interesting story. Diamond Comics is the largest comics distributor in North America. They have exclusive distribution deals with the four major U.S. comics companies (Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, and Image), and as a result, most comic book stores are forced to deal with Diamond whether they want to or not. Basically, they have a monopoly on North American comics distribution.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Department of Justice started an antitrust investigation against them. The investigation ended in 2000 and Diamond suffered no consequences because although the investigation found that they <em>do</em> have a monopoly on comics distribution, they don't have a monopoly on the distribution of all books.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm trying to figure out how to make my thesis topic narrower, so I thought I'd post my proposal to see if any has any suggestions, etc... I'm thinking about maybe just focusing on women. But perhaps as I dig deeper into the online communities I want to study, what I want to focus on will become clearer to me. Anyway, here's the proposal:</p>
<p>As postmodernism has influenced art and culture, it has also influenced the way we construct our identities. Under a postmodern model, conceptions of identity become more fluid, fractured, and wrought with a multiplicity of sources and meanings. Although postmodernism has been critiqued within the black community for its potential to deny the reality of lived experiences, I think that in this historical moment, postmodernism is crucial to expanding notions of blackness and black identity. The mainstream ideals of "authentic blackness" arise from social movements of the 1960s and often operate within the framework of a single-issue identity politics. Though these ideals were effective in achieving social, economic, and cultural gains for black people, they also "effectively hold the black community in stasis because they are not in sync with the fractures and fissures-- that frame the contemporary black experience" (Neal 6).</p>

Making comics on the web seems to have a lot of advantages: it's cheaper for the reader and can offer more control for the artist (possibility of more independent comics getting out there, animating images). </p>
<p>At the same time, I wonder about the drawbacks of a web/computer format. Over the summer I wanted re-read Neil Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em> series (which is great, btw), but I didn't really have the cash to spend $20+ on the books in the series I'm missing. So I ended up downloading the series online and reading the first few books in print and the rest on my computer. It was still a good read, but something was missing. One of the things McCloud talked about was color, and that may have been a factor, the differences between the color you see on your computer screen and the color that a printer can print. Another thing may have been reading strategy. In my Digital Art class, we talked about the idea that people tend to read things on the computer differently than the way they read books and other printed media. Reading on the web and the computer tends to be faster, more of a skimming for information. I definitely found myself getting caught up in that when I was reading <em>Sandman</em>.</p>
