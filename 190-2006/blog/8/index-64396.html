    <div class="content"><p>I'm about halfway through Understanding Comics, but I've already come across some interesting ideas, one of which I felt had a connection to House of Leaves. In Chapter 3, McCloud discusses <em>closure</em>, which is basically the reader filling in textual gaps, such as imagining what happens in between panels or even seeing something as simple at this :o) as a face. I think that closure also applies to House of Leaves. One part in particular which struck me was the section on Holloway's tape where most of the words had empty brackets in them where missing letters should be. Without closure, in this case the reader literally filling in those blanks, this section would have been completely unreadable.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I'm currently trying to write my thesis proposal, but despite the fact that I have an outline and quotes, my brain is saying no. I was thinking, maybe if I blog about it, I can get the juices flowing again. </p>
<p>So basically, my thesis is about Black rockers, postmodern black identities, and virtual communities. Like we talked about when we discussed the bell hooks article, "Postmodern Blackness," postmodernism has often been overlooked by the black community, yet it holds some really powerful ideas that could help to create conceptions of black identity that are more fluid, open, relevant to contemporary black lives, and that take into account the reality of diversity in the black community. I've come across two terms that describe this: post-black and newblack. I haven't entirely figured what the difference between these two are, but newblackness is defined as a contemporary moment in blackness which "embodies a radical fluidity within the spheres of blackness that allow for powerful conceptualizations across black genders, sexualities, ethnicities... socioeconomic positions, and socially constructed performances of 'black' identity"(Neal 122).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>So I was reading this article today online about the LA Gay and Lesbian Center's new ad campaign to fight the spread of HIV. Basically, the ads say "HIV is a gay disease. Own it. End it." The goal is to target apathetic gay men, which I think is valid, but the way they're going about seems seriously flawed to me.   "HIV/AIDS is a gay disease" is a stereotype that the queer community has been fighting against since the disease was discovered. It has been used as a justification for homophobia. I don't think that using language that comes out of a tradition of homophobic rhetoric is the wrong way to go. It also glosses over the ever increasing numbers of black women with AIDS today. There has to be a better way to raise awareness about HIV, for gay men and for everyone.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I guess I'll follow the trend and blog a bit about the movie that <em>I</em> saw this weekend. I went to the drive-in in Pomona as a sort of field trip for an organization that I'm a part of. My group/car decided to see <em>The Black Dahlia</em>-- let's just say I wish I had seen <em>Barnyard</em> or something instead. Although overall I was not a fan of the film, it did have a lot of interesting stuff going on concerning gender and sexuality. </p>
<p>*Mild Spoiler Alert*</p>
<p>The story is based on the murder case of a small-time actress in the late-40s. Two of the major female characters (including the murder victim) are bisexual. Although there's an awesome scene with kd lang singing in a lesbian nightclub, overall I felt the portrayal of bisexual women in the film was pretty lacking. One of them is murdered at the beginning of the film and only shown through screen tests and flashbacks, denying her any real in-depth character development. The other one ends up being a crazy psycho killer. It seems like there have already been enough films with bisexual women as crazy, deceitful, and conniving. Watching the film reminded me a bit of our discussion about the article on John Waters last week. We talked about the difference between films that are really engaged with queering mainstream Hollywood, and films that just have LGBTQ characters in them. In my opinion, <em>The Black Dahlia</em> was definitely one of the latter.</p>

<p>I'm from the group that's presenting this week and we have a quick announcement for you. Because "Authorship and Film" covers such a wide variety of content, we have decided that it would be best to focus our presentation on a few of the essays. They are:</p>
<p>Introduction<br />
"The Auteur Theory: Michael Curtiz, and <em>Casablanca</em>"<br />
"John Waters Goes to Hollywood: A Poststructuralist Authorship Study"<br />
"Making Films Asian American: <em>Shopping for Fangs</em> and the Discursive Auteur"</p>
<p>Please make sure you read these pieces for Wednesday's class. Thanks everyone!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I wrote about half a blog earlier today and then went to class, etc-- When I got back, I found that my computer had decided to install updates, restart, and wipe out my document. So this is take 2--</p>
<p>Overall I liked the Marchessault reading, it expressed a lot of the issues I had with the readings from last week. I find it interesting that the author be declared dead in a historical moment when more and more marginalized people were starting to write/gain access to the literary establishment. While I wasn't necessarily on board with the Freudian stuff, I enjoyed her discussion women's writing and feminist culture. Marchessault critiques the idea that there is one authentic "women's experience," but also recognizes that experience is important, in a pluralistic, non-essentializing manner. In this, I saw a lot of parallels to "Postmodern Blackness". Hooks recognizes the validity of personal experience while also suggesting that postmodernism may be a way to disrupt the idea of an "authentic" black experience. One of my favorite quotes from the Marchessault was, "The death of the author carries no political affectivity for feminist struggles precisely because it supports our violent exclusion from the public sphere" (89). Both writers are concerned with the exclusion of marginalized people from culture and the act of cultural production, and how they might begin to enter that discourse.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Reading msblogger's post got me thinking again about the Barthes essay, especially the part about ideas/texts not really being unique because everything is so socially constructed. Last semester for another class I read Paul D. Miller/AKA DJ Spooky's book "Rhythm Science" and it deals with a lot of similar themes in a new way. For Miller, everyone has to the potential to be a DJ of sorts, a role he links to the griot (a highly revered storyteller) in West African societies. You take aspects from culture, from the social constructions around us, and you sample and remix them to make them into something new that's relevant for you.</p>

      <span class="submitted">Submitted by ghostwriter on 3 September 2006 - 11:52pm.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Overall, I had a mixed reaction to the Barthes reading. In terms of the tendency to exalt "the Author" and seek out a direct correlation between the life and experiences of the author and the text, I agree with him in that this is problematic. As he states on page 50, "explanation of the work is still sought in the person of its producer, as if, through the more or less transparent allegory of fiction, it was always, ultimately, the voice of one and the same person, the author, which was transmitting his 'confidences'." I don't write fiction, but I do write music and I have definitely experienced people reading way too much into my songs, trying to analyze me probably even more than my work. The link between a text and its creator is much more complex than this. And here's where Barthes and I start to diverge, because I think that this link  - although it's not the be all and end all in literary analysis -  exists. And that it matters.</p>
