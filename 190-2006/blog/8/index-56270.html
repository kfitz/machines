    <div class="content"><p>We've talked a bit about Second Life in class, how they have their own economy, news bureau, etc-- But it seems now that Second Life is also becoming involved in the world of education. I read an article this morning, and apparently over 60 schools and other educational organizations are beginning to use Second Life as a pedagogical tool. One of the major ways in which it's being utilized is with distance learning programs. The article uses a law school class from Harvard as an example. The class is offered both to students who are residents and distance learners. Class discussions, the professor's office hours, and even some class-related events are held in Second Life. In this case, Second Life can be a way to use 3-D navigable space (props to Manovich!) to create a new, virtual classroom setting. The article also mentioned how this space offers a lot of potential for international students to get involved. This space offers a way for students and professors to interact as a group, regardless of geographical location.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I came across an interesting article today that brought me back to our discussions on <em>Authorship and Film</em>. The Onion AV Club had an article called "Do Screenwriters Really Matter?" in which two columnists debate about the role of screenwriter vs. the role of directors in film authorship. The piece uses a recent writer/director conflict as a jumping off point. Recently, director Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga (who have collaborated on three films, <em>Amores Perros, 21 Grams</em> and now <em>Babel</em>) decided to part ways, largely due to conflicts over authorship of their films. Arriaga has been quoted as saying, "When they say it's an auteur film, I say auteurs film. I have always been against the 'film by' credit on a movie. It's a collaborative process and it deserves several authors." However, since mainstream conceptions of film authorship center around the director, its easy to see how Arriaga's view might have put him into conflict with IÃ±Ã¡rritu.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was perusing the internet looking for things to blog about when I came across this weird article on cnn.com. Apparently, a man from a small town in Wisconsin was running for Sheriff and losing horribly. So rather than accept defeat, he legally changed his name to Andy Griffith. He claims it has nothing to do with the actor Andy Griffith or wanting to capitalize on the name to gain more votes for himself. Sorry guy, I'm not buying that. So now, the real Andy Griffith is suing the guy for violation of trademark and copyright laws. I feel bad for the guy, I mean, he lost went through the trouble of changing his name, but still lost the election <em>and</em> is now being sued. Sucks to be him, but this story does raise some interesting questions. With the increase in file sharing, copyrights are becoming a bigger and bigger issue. It's interesting to see this copyright paranoia carry over into something like a person's name. When does a name become more than just a name? When does it cross over into the realm of commodity?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I've been watching the new season of "Degrassi: The Next Generation" and as usual, they're dealing with interesting issues. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, "Degrassi" is a Canadian show about a group of teens in Toronto who go to a school called Degrassi, and the crazy stuff that happens to them. The tend to deal with a wide range of social issues, and the tagline for the show is "Degrassi: it goes there." So far this season we've had street-racing, jail, dating a co-worker, teen mothers, and the sexual problems faced by paraplegics. They just finished a two-part episode dealing with teens and internet safety and privacy, which I found really interesting. The premise of the story was that goody-goody Christian cheerleader Darcy (with the help of resident creep and all-around jackass Peter) starts posting sexy pics of herself on her blog in order to raise money for the cheerleading team. Peter tells Darcy that he has a friend who likes to read her blog, and this friend ends up being their benefactor of sorts. Although the pictures were password protected, some students hacked in and downloaded them, plus it turns out Peter's friend was just some random guy he met in a chatroom, who later shows up at Darcy's house, scaring the hell out of her.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I was thinking about Manovich's discussion of remixing in "Models of Authorship in New Media," when I remembered a really interesting example that I encountered in one of my classes last semester. DJ Spooky (aka Paul D. Miller) is a writer and DJ who recently created a project called "Rebirth of a Nation". This piece is basically a remix of the technically brilliant yet horribly racist film "Birth of a Nation". DJ Spooky remixes both the images and the sound, providing his own soundtrack. He says that, "By remixing the film along the lines of dj culture, I hoped to create a counter-narrative, one where the story implodes on itself, one where new stories arise out the ashes of that explosion." To me, this approach seemed very much in line with Manovich's view of remix. DJ Spooky aims to engage with the film in deeper, more deliberate manner than is implied by a term like "appropriation". As Manovich says, "'remixing' is a better term because it suggests a systematic re-working of a source, the meaning which 'appropriation' does not have."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So tonight I went to see Borat (which I will probably make a whole separate post about) and I saw an interesting preview before the feature presentation. The trailer was for Mel Gibson's new movie "Apocalypto," which comes out in December. After being confused by the trailer I went online when I got home to see what the movie was all about. So basically, it's about the decline of the Maya civilization. The trailer starts with a quote that's something like "A civilization can't destroyed from without until it's weakened from within". I thought that was a little odd, and seemed to be downplaying the effects of colonialism.</p>

Anway, in my Sociology of Popular Music class, people sometimes bring in music to share with the class. One guy showed the class a website called 8 bit peoples, which is basically a site for a group of people who make music using sound cards from old gaming systems. Commodore 64 and Gameboy seem to be the most popular ones to use. For Gameboy, someone even developed a cartridge called "Little Sound DJ" that allows users to program their own songs, using the sounds of the Gameboy itself along with electronic drum kit samples.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>not to be confused with Mark Z. Danielewski's <em>House of Leaves</em>. So basically, Dr. Phil has a new show called "House of Hatred" in which 6 very different people have to live in a house together, have their lives taped, and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. Actually, that's "The Real World", but the idea is similar. But in Dr. Phil's house, the people are literally positioned as the binary opposite of another person in the house and forced to room with this person. Pair number 1 is the white supremacist guy and the black woman who hates white people, followed by the thin girl who hates fat people and the 600 lb man who hates thin people, and lastly the homophobe and the straight-hating lesbian. Everything about this premise just rubs me the wrong way. First of all, for a guy like Dr. Phil who's known for saying "Get real!", this is incredibly contrived, and the binaries are so extreme whereas in real life, issues of ignorance and/or hate are so much more complex than this. Which brings me to my second point, which is that it eschews any attempt at a more complex (and more relevant) discussion about difference in our society by reducing the housemates to representing one thing in a binary rather than as complete people. Plus the name of the show is pretty awful.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Today I (somehow) dragged myself out of bed at 7:30am to go to "Models of Pride," which is an annual LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) youth conference held at Occidental College. A lot of the workshops were media-related, so I thought I'd just blog about my experience at the conference and some of the things I noticed.</p>
<p>Part One, or omg I'm old:<br />
First of all, the description of the event says it's a youth conference geared towards queer youth between the ages of 14 and 23. However, when I got there, I definitely felt that it was geared more towards high school students. When we were in small groups for an "icebreaker," my group of 12 had about 3 people over 18. But everyone was really nice. But I still felt really old basically the whole time I was there.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was doing research for my thesis, reading the forums on Afropunk.com when I came across an interesting thread that had a connection to our readings on videogames this week. People were talking about an article about racism in videogames, and specifically the Grand Theft Auto series. While most people agreed with the article (which condemned games like these for perpetuating racist stereotypes), a couple of poster were avid players of the game and felt that since there were stereotypes or everyone in the game, that made it okay. </p>
<p>Personally, I find the games very problematic, in particular "San Andreas", which is the one I've seen the most/heard the most about. If games are a form of cyberdrama and powerful new storytelling tool, it seems that when it comes to representations of people of color in mainstream media, the form may have changed but it's the same old story. I wonder who the intended audience for these games are. What does it mean for a white surburban kid to play as a black inner-city gangbanger? It will be interesting to see how larger systems of domination continue to affect (and limit) what kinds of stories games will tell.</p>
