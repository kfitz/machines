    <div class="content"><p>My computer crashed last week, and I'm just now starting to realize how much I'm in withdrawl.  I find myself coming home late at night and not knowing what to do before I fall asleep, since I can't watch a movie or a TV show on my computer.  I find myself wondering who's emailed me lately but unable to conveniently check.  I find myself waking up in the morning with a hankering to listen to a particular song but unable to, since I don't have access to my iTunes.  I can't even charge my iPod while my computer's broken.</p>
<p>I'm addicted, and it's sad.</p>
<p>Which leaves me with this question: does technology improve our lives, or does it make everything a little more complicated (especially when we're detached from that technology)?</p>

<p>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6160414.stm</p>
<p>It's about Universal Music Group suing MySpace for encouraging copyright infringement. Wtf? Why would they waste their time with this? It seems to me like MySpace's case is pretty airtight, as they've done less to encourage law-breaking than almost any musically-oriented site since prior to Napster's inception. In fact, MySpace is nothing but good for music - the industry, the musicians, the art form. This is a terrible PR move and an unwinnable case. Seriously, if anyone can see why a record company would continue the litigation against this particular site, let me know.</p>

The article said, "The PS3's promise is to extend digital entertainment  into a realm so mesmerizing that your consciousness will be sucked into a virtual world, an experience enhanced by a shared participation with friends..." Isn't that what drugs are for? </p>
<p>To be honest, I'm not sure there's a lot of difference between gamers and drug addicts. </p>
<p>When there's been a lot of busts at the border, drug prices go up because they're harder to get.<br />
When Sony released 20,000 PS3s for all of  North America, many units were on e-bay for $1000 and higher only hours later. The 'Buy-It-Now' price for some of these things? $5500!</p>

That way, it would be a snap to recruit people to come play with us. Interested in Psychology? Oh, you're an everything studies major for sure! Sociology? Literature? Anthropology? Drugs? Sex?

    <div class="content"><p>So in lieu of doing anything productive on a Sunday night (they're sacred, right?), I watched America's Next Top Model. I obviously wasn't expecting anything substantial, culturally aware, or even entertaining - just something to kill time. But it's deliberate avoidance of any of these ideas was incredible. </p>
<p>In just one episode, a girl admitted to having attempted suicide, and a Spanish guy told one of the models that he "didn't like black girls." Meanwhile we are supposed to be focused on the trials of the competition: "Nobody thinks I want this bad enough," "I don't feel pretty enough," "No one thinks models feel." The suicide attempt confession was blurted out during one of the "challenges" and after the shocked reaction shots, no one bothered ot mention it again. Except for saying that she was really brave and strong, it was a non-issue or even plotline in the show. She won the challenge for being so strong and brave.. and cut to her on One Tree Hill as a guest star. Whoo - suicide attempts make you a strong person with more emotion to tap into when you're acting.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This is mostly in response to the post about the videos of Lasse Gjertsen. I would just disagree with the first sentence that was said about 'Amateur.' I'm not sure it really brings up any questions of authorship. He is definitely the 'author' of that music. (I'm not sure though. when he starts playing the piano with the drums, that sounds so familiar. And too good, if you ask me. Someone should pay this guy to be doing something musically.)<br />
What most rap and hip-hop producers and artists do is very similar to what Lasse does. They mix different sounds and beats with computers. Lasse is just recording the video with the audio and creating more of a performance out of it.</p>

http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/internet/11/17/china.internet.ap/index.html</p>
<p>It seems so weird to me, since in the US you can basically find anything on the internet, despite some censorship. Freedom of speech is a huge debate in China, for fear of discussion of politically banned issues. There is apparently a lot of censorship of the internet access in China and I just found it interesting how much the Chinese government decides whose opinions can be expressed and what is inappropriate to put on the internet. Anyway, the topic is interesting, but if you don't want to read the whole thing (a whole 3 minutes of reading); here is the part I found most interesting:</p>

So she came over and brought her fiance and his friend. We were mostly playing video games and carrying on three conversations at once when my friend spotted my girlfriend's cell phone. It's one of those sleak, new "music phones". My friend immediately began to exclaim over the phone's cuteness and coolness, etc. She asked if my girlfriend had downloaded any music, which she hadn't because she didn't know how. So my friend brought out her phone to show her. My friend's phone, which she was given by a well-off friend who trades her's in every few months, was one of those cell/camera/mp3 player phones that flips open to reveal a larger screen, speakers, and a full qwerty keyboard. My girlfriend and I excalimed over the "sick"ness of her phone and she proceeded to extoll it's failings. Next thing I know everyone in the room had their phones out. Martinez (friend of fiance) was attempting to bluetooth his Razr to my friend's Sidekick to give her his ringtones, my friend was demonstrating to my girlfriend how to download media onto her phone, and fiance and I were comiserating about the realitve lameness of our phones.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last night I went to see the film BABEL with some friends and first of all, I would recommend it to anyone with a spare $10 and a couple of hours of free time. The film is beautiful, with magnificent scenes from various continents and it is visually magnificent.  The music is wonderful and the cast is great (I've never really been a Brad Pitt fan before, but his short amount of screen time in this film is actually really good). I love Gael Garcia Bernal and was pleased with his performance, but saddened by his small amount of screen time. The cast as a whole is great, even the kids.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to discuss this type of movie. I'll try to not spoil it for those of you who want to see it.  The film is constructed like Crash.  The film has storylines that connect at the end, despite all the major characters being on different continents and living very different lives.  I find this very interesting in terms of the narrative. Jumping between all the plots leaves the audience in suspense about one plot, then creates suspense for them in the next one.  I love this style of filmmaking. Films that have a straight-forward, linear narrative often have scenes that are slow, or not as enticing and I often lose interest. This choppy, non-linear style keeps drawing the audience back into the film and with this film, the variety of characters and scenes is amazing. Offering this wide range is beneficial, as it gives a wide variety of scenes, a wonderful ensemble cast (much like Crash), and different aspects for audience members to relate to.  I find it very interesting that this type of film has gained such popularity and prestige.</p>
