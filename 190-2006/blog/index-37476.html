    <div class="content"><p>For my thesis/seminar project-thing I want to write a personable lil' forward that sorta explains why/how I decided upon this project.  I think it will make it a little more interesting.  Is anyone really against this?  So far, of the research books I've read, I've by far enjoyed the ones that speak in the first person from time-to-time, talking of personal experiences and whatnot.</p>
<p>My experience, of course, comes from being an intern for a small part of a large coorporation--I don't claim to know much but what I've experienced, and I believe I've experienced enough to justify a Forward.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I just discovered the <a href="http://www.keepachildalive.org/i_am_african/i_am_african.html"> "I Am African" campaign website</a>, which features images of celebrities like Sarah Jessica Parker, Richard Gere, Elizabeth Hurley, and Elijah Wood in tribal makeup.  Sure, it's for a good cause (i.e. raising money for AIDS victims)... but as neurotica said in response to my post about Regina Spektor's video for "On the Radio," it's the impact and not the intention that really counts.</p>
<p>The impact here, in my opinion, is the exotification of African culture.  The face paint creates a false image of Africans as primitive.  My friend who spent the last two summers in Africa says she has never once seen anyone there in tribal makeup.  To make matters worse, it's not even an "authentic" representation, since Iman has said that it's something along the lines of a "modern reinterpretation of the African aesthetic" (okay, she didn't exactly phrase it that way, but that's the jist of it).  I'm also struck by how "sexed up" the images of women are.  Whereas David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, Alan Cumming, Richard Gere, and Elijah Wood have shirts on, all of the women are completely naked, except for the occasional necklace or headdress.  They also wear tons of makeup, and their hair has that studio-produced windblown look to it.  They seem like sex symbols to such a degree that the humanitarian message gets completely lost.  The pictures comprise most of the advertisement, and the phrase "I AM AFRICAN" appears in large text at the bottom, but the actual message of the campaign is in such tiny print that it would probably not even catch someone's eye as they flip through a magazine.  In short, pretty much everything about this campaign seems flawed to me.  Our common humanity is a positive message, but it just doesn't come through when it's depicted through such naive and offensive imagery.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Apparently, the old Ben Franklin quote that "nothing is certain but death and taxes" will become applicable in a new way. That's right folks, governments are beginning to think about taxing virtual assets that people acquire in virtual worlds like <em>Second Life</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. I came across this <a>article</a> on cnet.com, which talks about the State of Play/Terra Nova symposium, a yearly conference that is held to discuss the social and economic implications of virtual worlds. According to one of the economist quoted in the article, "given growth rates of 10 to 15 percent a month, the question is when, not if, Congress and IRS start paying attention to these issues." The article goes on to talk about estate taxes, and a report that's been commissioned for next year by the Joint Economic Committee, which will probably really get the ball rolling on all of this. The article definitely gives the sense that taxing virtual assets is inevitable (I mean, that's basically the article's title) and is something we shouldn't be surprised to see in the future. It's really interesting to see the wide scope of virtual worlds, how they have economies and other aspects that we typically attribute only to the real world. It will also be interesting to see how institutions in the real world will have to learn to interact will virtual worlds, and how we might reconcile the real and the hyperreal.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Lately I've been loving Regina Spektor's songs and music videos (I recommend "Fidelity," "Samson," "Us," and "On the Radio" for starters), but I noticed some controversy on YouTube surrounding her work, and I thought it might be worth mentioning here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_7H992f4vw">Regina Spektor's music video for "On the Radio"</a></p>
<p>As you'll see if you click on the link, the video shows Regina as a teacher in an elementary school music classroom.  Sounds innocent enough, right?  But if you dig through the 90+ comments that have been left on the page, you'll see that lots of people aren't too happy with the fact that Regina is white and all the schoolchildren are black.  Some people called it "colonialist," implying that Regina sees herself as the "white woman who takes it upon herself to educate the black children."  One person left the comment, "Sooooooo racist."  Other people say that there should have been children of ALL races in the video (even though that strikes me as a little too "It's a Small World After All"... if that phrase can be used as an adjective... oh well, you get what I mean).  I have to admit that it did strike me as a little odd at first, but I figured that Regina seems a little too sensitive and poetic to be a crazy colonialist.  I really doubt that she intended for the video to cause any kind of controversy.  Nevertheless, people have read it as problematic, which says a lot about how race is perceived in popular media.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I had no idea I could learn anything from primetime TV. I just thought I was just wasting my time and killing brain cells, but I think that tonight I learned something. Studio 60 is fun, too. Okay, all of a sudden I've started plugging, which I didn't mean to do in this post, back to the facts.</p>
<p>They staged a conversation tonight about government control of broadcasting. I haven't been living in a closet for the past ten years (who could miss Nipplegate at the superbowl) so I knw that the FCC exists and I know they censor stuff, but I didn't know how easily a broadcasting network/station could have its license pulled for indecency. The fictional storyline involves a live news cast in which an RPG explodes over the correspondent's head and then he curses, not just any curse but the f-bomb. So the FCC levies a lawsuit against the network that would essentially be impossible to pay for, and threaten to revoke broadcasting rights. The government also obviously controls the flow of much of the information, especially about governmental related news (i.e. the war). They could easily shut a network or broadcasting service out of these stories. I'm just realizing that I should know a lot more about the news, how it is produced, and government involvement. And you have to work a lot harder than I realized to find truly independent sources. Any recommendations?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've never actually played this game, so some of what I tell you in this blog may be slightly incorrect, but part of me is simply wondering if anyone has played this. In my Race Theory in the Media course, we have to do a final paper and present what we are discussing to the class. A fellow student in my  course recently presented about an interactive video game called Indigo Prophecy (XBox). It is also known as Fahrenheit. My classmate described it as a combination of narrative film and video game. </p>
<p>Basically, the player is the main character (Lucas) and makes decisions for the character which change the outcome of the narrative. The game starts with Lucas waking up from a trance after just killing someone. He has to figure out why he killed them before he is arrested. So the opening scene has the player (as Lucas) cleaning up the crime scene. However, the amount of clean-up the player does effects the outcome of the story after that. The person playing the game has several different choices about what to do in each scenario and each choice effects the outcome of the game.  Like I said, I've never played, but it sounded pretty interesting.  And pretty relevant to our discussions about narrative and video games.  According to my peer it received a lot of praise for attempting to reinvent this genre of video games and it is pretty interesting.  Just wondering if anyone has ever played before or knows anything about it...</p>

On Friday night, for example, I was up until three in the morning downloading tracks from PartyBen.com. This is the genius behind the American Edit remix of the Green Day American Idiot album. I don't know if you all have heard of this, because I just read about it, but this time last it had Warner Brothers getting a cease and desist order against the guy. It's kind of cool, and I found a mySpace page that has decided to post many of the songs...available for download of course.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>As a self proclaimed music junkie,(bad included...I listened to Beyonce's B-Day this afternoon) I have taken a particular interest in this P2P slash music downloading versus legal buying discussion.  Since some of you have posted your personal music collecting habits, I thought I would share mine since I have been curious to hear how other go about finding their groove thang. </p>
<p>Anyway, I have always been somewhat neurotic about my music collection aka spend hours upon hours relabeling songs on itunes, reorganize my music collection regularly, and buy the real CD when I have a burned copy because I think burned CD's are ugly. Sometimes my music habits are borderline OCD and create a serious distraction for me but sometimes that is just how I roll.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I"ve just spent the last two hours watching the A&amp;E series called Intervention - and wow it may have just become my new obsession as much as it disturbs me. I have yet to decide how I feel ethically about the show. I should explain the premise briefly, so that y'all understand the disturbing depths of the concept. They find someone who agrees to be on a show about addiction (I think that's all their told), then they have their lives taped for a few weeks or so, then they are thrust into an unexpected intervention - all under the watchful eye of the camera. You see a girl looking for tricks to turn in order to buy heroin, an ex-ceo crying in his storage unit that contains his only remaining possessions, a middle-aged alcoholic falling out of her car. It is intimate to say the least. Actually, I'm pretty sure that it is downright exploitative. At times it's almost uncomfortable to be watching these so intensely personal moments, but you can't look away at the same time.</p>
