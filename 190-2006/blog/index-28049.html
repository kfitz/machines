    <div class="content"><p>So, in section four of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray says:</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, the Internet is beginning to function as an alternate broadcasting system-- as television channels and the World Wide Web come closer together, the telephone, computer, and cable industries are racing to deliver the new digital content to the end user faster and in greater quantities"(253).</p>
<p>I think that we're definitely seeing the ways in which the Internet is influencing TV. I find that nearly all of my TV watching is on my computer and is facilitated by the internet, even when I'm at home for holidays and have more access to actual TV. While most TV on the internet is provided by users (such as the person who puts the latest episodes of <em>America's Next Top Model</em> on YouTube. Thank you, whoever you are--), the TV broadcasting companies are getting in on the TV on the internet train too. Aside from iTunes, which has deals with several networks to sell episodes in the iTunes Music Store, some networks have their shows available for free on their websites. Two examples would be abc.com and the-n.com. ABC uses the tagline "Watch tonight on TV, watch tomorrow online". The-N has a section of their website called "The Click" where viewers can watch full episodes of shows, as well as previews for upcoming shows, and "webisodes"(which are kind of like the gutter space between episodes). Although there are still commercials, there are far less than on real TV and they tend to be only at the beginning of the episode. It will be interesting to see if more companies follow suit, and what effect the corporate presence (and copyright laws) will have on the more user dominated forms.</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XwdkxPQCzY</p>
<p>That is a fan-made "Kirk/Spock" movie like the book discusses.  I find it highly entertaining.</p>
<p>Then please watch:<br />

<p>I think next week we should all go LARP somewhere.  You know, like out on the quad?  We can show our appreciation for...media...culture.  However I'd like to state beforehand that I need all the spell components to cast "magic missile".</p>
<p>While I'm on the topic of LARPing, another fact that I found interesting from HOTH was the commentary on online communities.  Does anyone else have friends who emerge only to consume nourishment and excrete waste?  I don't really, becaues I'm too cool, but I know such people exist.  They live through a World of Warcraft Identity; sometimes an elf, sometimes a dancing bear, always a prisoner to their magical avatar.  There are actually help forums and hotlines now for online game addicts.  I kid you not.  It's only a few numbers different from helplines for people who like J-Lo.</p>

<p>I hope to present evidence of how photographic truth has historically been a flawed and fictitious concept, how photographs have been manipulated for political purposes over time, and how this idea affects the present and will develop in the future.  I will further investigate these issues through research at the library and consultation with Professor Kathleen Howe and Professor Sheila Pinkel (specifically in relation to the history and theory of photography) and Professor Kathleen Fitzpatrick (focusing on digital imaging).  </p>
<p>STRUCTURE:</p>
<p>My thesis will consist of four chapters, each ranging from 10 to 20 pages in length, as shown in the outline below:</p>

I don't know much about regualtions regarding the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses, but it seems to me that it should be something that is enforced without me having to buy overpriced proucts just to be sure that these animals are not being "slaughtered." anyhow the article is interesting. </p>

    <div class="content"><p>Reading Hamlet on the Holodeck, among many things, got me thinking about the possibilities of future technology especially in the gaming industry. It seems after any new gaming system comes out I always find myself thinking that this is as good as it gets.  Game technology can advance no further than Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt for the original Nintendo. But then, not long after comes Mario All-Stars for the Super Nintendo, Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega, Mario Cart for N64.... And though my heart remains with, Super Mario III for regular Nintendo, game technology just just keeps getting better and better.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, so I'm still in the earlier parts of the book, but I've had some thoughts already regarding much of what Murray has been saying. Some background first:</p>
<p>So I'm taking Intro to Comp Sci mostly to fulfill an Area Requirement, but also because it counts toward Media Studies major requirements. Initially, I thought, "Really? That doesn't make any sense!" except for the fact that computers are a form of media, but we had never really discussed a theory of computers (that I recall) in any of my previous theory classes. As I explain to people who are as incredulous as I that I'm taking this class, I'm often met with similar reactions and frequently have to justify it. Sometimes it's hard. Because of the department's association with the Math department, it's prettyer similar to a math class. There's a lot of analytical thinking required and much of programming language (with which I am not at all well acquainted) is fairly obtuse. Additionally I had a real crisis of faith today after receiving a pretty terrible grade on my midterm exam. Why am I doing this, I asked.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One of the things that really interested me in <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> was Murray's discussion of fan-fiction. Although fan-fiction exists in many forms, I think that now we're seeing more and more fan videos, and with the widespread use of YouTube, these are becoming more accessible to viewers. For example, from Harry Potter, to Batman, to Saved by the Bell, there's a plethora of gay slash fan videos on YouTube. </p>
<p>Fan-fiction tends to remain in its own bubble, generally either ignored or hated by the companies that produced the original texts (or in the case of Anne Rice, banned. What a bitch.). But in the past couple of years, there have been two incidents where fan videos have actually influenced film production. The first one is <em>X3: The Last Stand</em>. Towards the end of the film, during a confrontation with Shadowcat, Juggernaut says to her, "Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut bitch!". The line is taken from a fan video made by using footage from the early-mid-90s X-men cartoon with blaxploitation style voice-overs. The second example of course would be <em>Snakes on a Plane</em>, whose famous line comes from a fan video and wasn't origninally in the film. The popularity of the catchphrase online led to the studio to shoot more footage and add it into the film.</p>

There have been such channels for awhile, such as BET, Lifetime, Oxygen and Spike TV. However, what interested me about the Asian and the Queer ones (Besides the fact that those are both part of my identities and the channels suck less than Oxygen and Lifetime), is that they are new, so they are in the process of creating what asian-american identity is or what queer identity is in television. this is particularly true with asian-americans, since there is virtually no asian-american programming outside these networks. What statements do these channels say with their programming? Do they cater to a wide audience within their respective targets or do they offer a limited view? At home, I have access to AZN TV. It's programming is interesting. It has some specifically Asian-American programming, like one that looks at upcoming films, another that looks at asian-american comedians, and another that will document a few students while their applying to ivy league colleges. mixed in with asian-american programming, is straight up asian programming from asia, like those korean dramas i've been talking about. in this construction of asian-america, while the channel acknowledges that there is a unique asian-american identity, they create a link with both america and asia by featuring asian programming. asian-american encompasses many different people, it can apply to those who have just immigrated (if they choose to identify as such) or those born here after generations of parents living here. does AZN TV unite these people? in my own experience, my mom would watch the channel alot for her korean soap operas, which is pretty devoid from dealing with the issues of racism that asian-americans have to deal with. however, during the channel promos that would be shown during commercials, various hosts from other shows would talk about their experiences with being asian-american...so my lil asian mommy who doesn't directly discuss the issues of race and asian-americana becomes exposed to those issues, and i the american can become exposed to asian cultural exports. however, AZN TV is still pretty heterocentric (though there was one segment in the film show once that talked about the queer film "Saving Face" but other than that it's heterocity). also, almost all the asian-american hosts of shows are east asian, only one is south asian, only one is mixed. AZN TV only represents a very specific segment of Asian-America.</p>
