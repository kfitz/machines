    <div class="content"><p>So for the presentation, if you get a chance, take a look at "What Does a Very Large-Scale Conversation Look Like?" by Warren Sack. It's related to the Vesna article and is kind of weird. One thing that struck me in these two chapters that I think people should think about for the presentation tomorrow is the distance between academia and real people. This is a major problem I have with much of academia that gets too wrapped up in the theoretical and ignores what real people are doing or thinking. Thinking back on our previous readings, I was okay with the Foucault, Barthes articles because they were being academics wrapped up in academic subjects.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After I posted, I thought of another good example of how the relationship between form and content could either seem interesting or just gimicky.<br />
I am reminded of the difference between the films, "Time Code" by Mike Figgis and "Memento" by Christopher Nolan. (Did I make a concsious choice in saying who the author of the film was? Did I preface the director over the screenwriter or vice versa? Well in both films, the director was the screenwriter, so no choice between the two had to be made!) Granted, I saw Time Code once when I was 14, so maybe if I watch it again my opinion would be different. In Time Code, the screen is divided into four segments, and in each segment the viewer simultaneously. The story deals with love, sex, infidelity, with people working within the entertainment industry. The structure in a way did make the story, in the sense, that in one frame we see a woman witnessing her girlfriend cheating on her (she hid a mic on her girlfriend somehow, and was listening to the sounds in her car) while in the other frame, we see the situation of the cheating. you can see different angles of the same stories, it's layered, etc. Howver, I felt that this story didn't complement the structure well enough. It was just kind of a soap opera-y tale of people working in Hollywood. While the content was enhanced by the structure, in didn't take full advantage of the unique structure.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When reading First Person, I immediately noticed the layout. For a book addressing issues of new media, merging forms of storytelling, it felt that the layout was designed to somewhat reflect that. At the tops of each page, is the name of the section and the name of the authors and reponders, positioned in a way where the text looks like links. There were other ways where the layout reminded me of a web page. Unlike other books, where the responses to an article would be merely posted after the article, here they are posted simultaneously with the article, on the bottom third of the page. This is interesting because while I was reading the article, I was visually reminded that there were multiple point of views to this topic, instead of being completely immersed in the text at hand as the end all be all. In a way, the reader is presented with the multitude of possibilities, that Murray is so fond of, in the reading experience. Also, since the responses didn't come directly at the end, after I read the article, I would have to turn back the pages and start over. This reminded me of being on a poorly designed page, where I would have to always press the back button after reading something to get back to the menu. In this way, the reading of the book isn't exactly a linear process. In addition to this, the articles are divided in columns, which is reminiscent of a newsletter or a newspaper, so it's like a combination of thesis different mediums born of different eras.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Instead of annotated bibliographies, those of us doing new media projects are turning in "drafted project outlines elaborating on the project's structure".  Professor Fitzpatrick suggested that for my project, I use mind mapping software to lay out the structure of my thesis, which was pretty much suggesting that I reunite after a year with one of my favorite programs on Earth: Free Mind.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines a mind map as "an image-centered diagram that represents semantic or other connections between portions of information. By presenting these connections in a radial, non-linear graphical manner, it encourages a brainstorming approach to any given organizational task, eliminating the hurdle of initially establishing an intrinsically appropriate or relevant conceptual framework to work within".  Basically, picture the brainstorming with little bubbles that you did on paper in elementary school, but far more sophisticated, easily editable, and on the computer.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When reading through First Person, I noticed that two of the authors provided conflicting analysis of the consumerism aspect of The Sims.  In "Video Games of the Oppressed", Frasca says, "The consumerist ideology that drives the simulation is nothing short of disturbing:  the amount of friends that you have literally depends on the number of goods that you own." I couldn't find the other quote, but it came later in the book with the author taking the stand that The Sims produces feelings of strong anti-consumerism.  Buying more things means working harder to get them. If you get your litl brat too many toys they may become spoiled.  If you buy a huge crib you have to pay for someone to take care of it ect.</p>

<p>The opening line of the essay was, "Are we in danger of drowning in blogorrhea? Of being swamped like Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason at the end of How to Commit Marriage in chin-high sludge?"

    <div class="content"><p>So, this class has me constantly thinking about authorship in many aspects of my life, and in particular my use of the internet recently. The reading for this week and last week have made me really look at the internet more critically and think about websites that I frequently visit.  One site that I enjoy that relates really well to authorship is   www.postsecret.com  .  It is a site where people send in anonymous postcards that have their inner-most secrets written on them. I think this is important in relation to authorship specifically because of the anonymous element the internet provides. Like blogging, which can be anonymous, the internet provides people a space to voice their opinions and feelings without having to do it in awkward social settings or in a place where they feel they could be scrutinized or openly judged. What I like about postsecret.com is that people can let out these secrets that they have bottled up inside and it allows them to have the emotional release of telling someone, without actually having to tell someone.  The site also does a lot to help people who have various issues from eating disorders to depression.  It is like an anonymous support group at times, where people can share and others are there for them and can respond to their postcards. People all over the world can connect with these people's secrets, realize that they are not the only ones with problems and realize that everyone has secrets they wish they could let out.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Something other than video games:</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of you have heard about the film DEATH OF A PRESIDENT, a faux-doc on the assassination of George W. Bush.  It's been destroyed by some critics and hailed by others, and won the International Critics award at the Toronto Fest.  </p>
<p>Its distributor, Newmarket, is having one hell of a time distributing the film in American markets. Theaters are blackballing them like no other.  AMC claims "We don't feel it's appropriate to play a film that depicts the assassination of our current president."  (Entertainment Weekly, #905, pg 18)  </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Newmarket is responsible for the release of everyone's favorite antisemetic take on HOSTEL...none other than Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  Execs seem comfortable with the limited release, knowing that being blacklisted can greatly aid a film's popularity.  People will certainly hear about the film, and if they want to see it, they'll see it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm having a really hard time reading First Person. That's because I don't own it and Lindsay is being pretty stingy with letting me borrow hers. From what I have read, which is some mind you, I am pretty sure this book was written by videogame fanatics for other, equally academically inclined videogame fanatics. I have never been really into computer games since i broke the floppy for prince of persia, unless you count the first semester fo my freshman year when I played Snood to ease the pain. That being said, I understand how rapidly the market for computer games is growing I'm baffled by it, but I know that it's happening. Still, reading people's in depth analysis of computer games is a struggle for me. It could be that I'm being closed-minded and considering videogames to be low art. I mean, I have no problem listening to people discuss film or television at length. But when I'm reading these essays in First Person, all I can do is picture the "computer kids" from high school sitting in the cafeteria discussing this stuff, except now they're in their 20s and their awful beards are beginning to show signs of life.</p>
