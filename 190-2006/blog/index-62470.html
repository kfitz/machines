    <div class="content"><p>I just thought that I had to share this all with you.  I got one of my "CNN Breaking News" emails today, expecting to see something about the outcome of elections, how election day was going, or something like that.  No, what CNN feels is most important to tell me today, Election Day, is that Britney Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline.  And CNN is supposed to be one of the serious news sources that will tell me important information about the world.  While I see that some citizens view things such as Britney's love life as something more important that voting (maybe that's why we have such low voter turnouts), I would think that the CNN Breaking News Bulletins would be saved for something a little more academic or political and that people could find out stuff about Britney's divorce procedures on people.com ??</p>

The more defined the look of the character, the easier it becomes to view them as Other. </p>
<p>This past weekend I watched Todd Haynes' 1995 film, "Safe". Never before had I watched a film that so vehemently refused to sculpt its main character in any way. Carol, the protagonist, is almost affect-less throughout the entire film. Both her physical appearance as well as her interiority are not much more than a blank slate. She remains pretty expressionless throughout the whole film and her wardrobe is completely indistinct. Additionally, the audience gains no insight into her thoughts, her rationality, her inner life. As a character, she is empty.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I meant to post on this a few days ago...but here goes! When I first read the introductory paragraph for Frasca's article, "Video Games of te Oppressed", I became intriged by the notion that video games have the potential to be a tool of social justice and tolerance. Though he mentions social justice, he doesn't explain it as a concep The word oppressed pretty much comes in the title, and in references to Boal's and Freire's works. Oppression, social justice, and tolerance become buzz words he throws around, and his analysis of how they can be addressed in video games seemed shallow to me as a result. While I liked how he talked abot Boal's theories about how theatre is a tool for  debate, not a goal or a solution in itself, and how it would be powerful to implement this philosophy in video games, his examples on what can be done did not live up to the grand ideas he was setting up. The examples of potential models of games, which he gives, seem to do little in addressing groups that have been institutionally marginalized. He doesn't really talk about these groups and their access to video games in general, which is salient to this issue. In an abstract way, one could argue that his proposed Pac-Man like game with bullies, invites dialogue about very real issues of how to deal with conflict. Likewise, his SIMS fantasy of an alcoholic mother character that you could merge with greenpeace activist, may also incite dialogue about issues of parenthood, substance abuse, and activism, and the plethora of different behaviors and personalities that could exist under these categories, which a user can use to modify the character. In a world where you're competing with Halo, and World of Warcraft, or whatever, would these games stand a chance?  Would they operate in a different space then mainstream games hold, like being mandatory in a classroom?</p>

<p>A dorky anecdote: In middle school I used to sneak on the internet after school to learn HTML and work on designing my tripod.com Nirvana fan site.  This was back in the day when turning a hyperlink red instead of nursery school-blue was a big deal, frames were hard to make, and text was presented in long, linear, unadorned chunks.  Little did I know my parents were still paying by the minute for our internet connection and when they caught on after a couple of months when our internet bill skyrocketed, I was internet-grounded.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>SO this weekend a student-directed theatre production, STOPKISS, went up. And yours truly was overzealous enough to agree to help stage manage rehearsals -- and seeing the final product really got me thinking about authorship and theatre. I haven't delved too deeply in this yet, but I wonder if a part of it's unique appeal is how authorship is constantly shifting in the message/meaning of a play. A playwright does his or her thing, and writes the text and all that. Then a director reads, feels inspired, and pitches his or her vision to a producer to get the thing up. Then actors interpret and create, and finally an audience receives the combined efforts, and I wonder how that equation flow chart actually manages to not come off as completely schizophrenic and impossible to comprehend. It seems almost miraculous, but then again it would also lead to me new conclusions about why live theatre, hell live performances, are only attended by less than 2% of the American Population.  26% apparently still go see movies -- at least 3 a year or month, I can't remember exactly, whereas 98% watch television regularly--</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Basically, I went on the Price is Right today and I need to blog more, so I am going to write about the experience and connect it to authorship. First of all, ridiculous people go on the Price is Right.  It was amazing... people from Florida with shirts that said "My Gator is Neutered" are a prime example.  Anyway, I went on the show with my rugby team (and a few friends of ruggers) and a girl on the team was picked (Angie Martinez, she goes to Pitzer).<br />
It got me thinking... I was reminded of our discussion of Authorship and Film because I got to see so many elements of the show happening, such as the cameras and all the crew running around to make sure everything was right.  It allowed me to see how many people really are involved in the process.  And also it got me thinking about the formulaic narratives we have been discussing with Hamlet on the Holodeck and First Person.  The Price is Right follows such a formula, it's almost ridiculous.  However, the audience plays a role in the outcome of the show and plays an important part in the show environment.  The contestants are picked from the audience and typically the members of the audience are frequent viewers, so the viewer is somewhat involved in the outcome of the show.  And while the producers pick who those selected audience members are, the audience is still involved in creating the atmosphere and helping the game players choose prices.</p>

<p>I read some comments about this interview in which people were defending Bush, saying that no one his age really knows about Google, the Internet, and that sort of thing.  Basically, they think everyone should stop "picking on the president" and quit looking for ways to criticize him. But to me, it's not just about the Google thing... It's about the way that he clumsily articulates himself.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So tonight I went to see Borat (which I will probably make a whole separate post about) and I saw an interesting preview before the feature presentation. The trailer was for Mel Gibson's new movie "Apocalypto," which comes out in December. After being confused by the trailer I went online when I got home to see what the movie was all about. So basically, it's about the decline of the Maya civilization. The trailer starts with a quote that's something like "A civilization can't destroyed from without until it's weakened from within". I thought that was a little odd, and seemed to be downplaying the effects of colonialism.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In the "Escape" section of today's New York Times, there was an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/travel/escapes/03second.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">article</a> about <em>Second Life</em>.  The piece starts off with a description of an angry Ben Folds getting drunk on stage, shooting laser beams from his eyes, then attacking the audience with a light saber.  The author's avatar, Urge Gainsbourg (wtf?), "vacations" in <em>Second Life</em> for the weekend, staying in an online version of Starwood Hotel's new Aloft hotel (which will appear in the real world in 2008).  According to Matt Gross, "Aloft's arrival- on a digital tropical island somewhere in a vast virtual ocean- may itself signal the beginning of <em>Second Life</em> as a casual travel destination."</p>
