    <div class="content"><p>Looking through my copy of the Marchessault reading, I noticed that I wrote a lot of notes next to the part about graffiti on a woman's washroom wall.  She draws a substantial amount of meaning out of the quote: "Now that women can be authors, the author is dead."  I don't know about you, and I don't know how things are at York University, but I've never seen anything this "deep" on a bathroom wall.  Most of the things people write while on the toilet, whether in Sharpie or lipstick or carved painstakingly with a pocketknife, are usually far less profound.  All that aside, though, I don't necessarily think that gender has anything to do with the death of the author (at least not as Barthes defined it).  It seems that the dead author is gender-neutral.    If one believes that in the modern era the author becomes displaced by his or her language and essentially becomes his or her language, it should not matter whether this displaced author is a man or a woman, at least not in Barthes' terms.</p>

No, instead I'm referring to the experience of reading many of the rest of your commentary on the reading (particularly the Marchessault, as that's the only one I've read thus far).</p>
<p>I finished that essay about forty-five minutes ago and understood very little of it. I got the gist about feminist theory not really jiving with Barthes and Foucault's opinions regarding authorial death. I understood the Freudian and Lacanian stuff because that harkened back to several previous Media Studies classes. My favorite part was the anecdote about the woman leading that party in the House of Commons in Britain. Needless to say, I think many of the major points flew right past me, caught in the rushing tide of verbosity, oblivious to my eager and wistful gaze. I felt much like one of the previous bloggers did, needing some English (but not in that scary xenophobic way).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Being a videogamer since I was a wee little kid, it was really nice to read about the scholarly merits of computer games as a true form of "new media". Manovich writes how "In short, the computer database and the 3-D computer-based virtual space have become true cultural forms- general ways used by the culture to represent human experience, the world, and human existence in this world" (215). It is amazing to me how technologically advanced "cultural forms" have come from it's early days of sticks and stones. I wonder though how far this form, especially in the form of video and computer games, has come in the academia. I believe that the current academic culture has deemed videogames as a form that is meant only for children and teenagers as a form of leisure and fun and not so readily acceptded by the academia. Yes, I played "Oregon Trail" as a elementray student, but I have yet to play an appropriate computer game since highschool or coming to college for class. One would not likely see a history class playing a game of "Age of Empires" or "Civilization" or "SimCity" for economics class though the benefits and "the human experience of being in the world," would be tremendous. I would not likely play a game of "Zelda" or "Final Fantasy" to learn about the narrative structure for an English class, though I have been just as awe-struck and amazed by the beauty of their stories as much as "The Odyssey" or "Romeo and Juliet".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have to ask a quick question that I think we were going to address last class, but never got around to.  Prof Fitzpatrick said that one of our readings from last week was by a structuralist, another by a poststructuralist, and the third somewhere in between.  I'm not too familiar with the terms but I think structuralists see the world as a series of language systems, and poststructuralists stress the inadequacy of language.  </p>
<p>Is Barthes then the structuralist, Foucault the poststructuralist, and Nesbit in between?  But then I have written that Foucault is "interested in the ways power circulates through discourse" - does this make him a structuralist?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Both authors brought up the issue of language as a stumbling block in the participation of non-mainstream groups in the mainstream of intelligentsia. As someone who's grown up surrounded by academics (I'd say a good 1/3 of my family, extended and otherwise, are professors), this is not something that I ever realized was a problem, as academic-speak comes almost more naturally to me than that Spanish I took for four or five years.</p>
<p>As someone who would probably be considered a member of both oppressed groups that we are considering this week (as a woman, and as a "racial minority"), I have to wonder what the solution to the problem of the dominant academic language being sourced from a different "culture" would look like. As Bell Hooks discusses it, it makes perfect sense--black youth choose not (or perhaps cannot) to participate as heavily in what might be considered "high culture" or "academic" cultural pursuits simply because these activities, as we perceive them in the wider Western culture, simply have no bearing on their cultural experience... they are not framed in a "language" or set of conceptual building blocks which they can consider their own, and therefore a language they feel they cannot adequately express themselves in.</p>

<p>There are so many side issues dealing with, for example, what exactly is feminism? why does it exist? what about the continuing issues of racism as a hegemonic imbalance of power, as Bell Hooks deals with? I find it problematic that (despite the fact that I, as someone who personally finds these issues relevant and therefore has some background in these things) we're given these readings and left to just take at the author's word that these issues are real, and exist exactly as they are described.</p>

<p>Clearly, if what Marchessault says is true, the women who are authors are powerless... the very fact that their ideas are considered so diffuse and lacking in authority that their presence in the role of "author" destroys the validity of the author as an exalted persona. Nonetheless, this continuation of the denial of power to women as a whole ironically allows for the playing field between the genders to be evened somewhat, as men authors are also denied the power of an exalted author persona once the author is "killed".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While reading the Marchessault, I'm not gonna lie, I found myself a bit confused at times.  Hopefully tomorrow's discussions will point me to a clear interpretation. However, I found the reading interesting and many of the key elements Marchessault noted really stuck in my head (particularly the connection between many white males  denying authorship was when marginalized people who had historically not received complete authority to authorship.) So like some of the other blogs, I'm going to focus on the part that seemed most coherent and interesting to me.  On page 86 Marchessault states "In opposition to Barthes' dead author, the lack of authority that women writers encounter is not celebrated but healed and overcome through political community.  The communication of experiences particular to women's lives is precisely what should constitute women's writing, forging a path for a new unity of women readers and writers that redefines the universal."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I wrote about half a blog earlier today and then went to class, etc-- When I got back, I found that my computer had decided to install updates, restart, and wipe out my document. So this is take 2--</p>
<p>Overall I liked the Marchessault reading, it expressed a lot of the issues I had with the readings from last week. I find it interesting that the author be declared dead in a historical moment when more and more marginalized people were starting to write/gain access to the literary establishment. While I wasn't necessarily on board with the Freudian stuff, I enjoyed her discussion women's writing and feminist culture. Marchessault critiques the idea that there is one authentic "women's experience," but also recognizes that experience is important, in a pluralistic, non-essentializing manner. In this, I saw a lot of parallels to "Postmodern Blackness". Hooks recognizes the validity of personal experience while also suggesting that postmodernism may be a way to disrupt the idea of an "authentic" black experience. One of my favorite quotes from the Marchessault was, "The death of the author carries no political affectivity for feminist struggles precisely because it supports our violent exclusion from the public sphere" (89). Both writers are concerned with the exclusion of marginalized people from culture and the act of cultural production, and how they might begin to enter that discourse.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I know I should have asked this before, but it's been a really busy week and I *thought* I had the right readings. Like atleast one other person, I printed out the Marchessault and the Manovich becuause they were the only readings posted that we hadn't already done. It occured to me belatedly that "Forms" seemed a little out of place. So I consulted the syllabus and upon discovering that we were supposed to have read bell hooks I started looking frantically for it. But I can't find it. Am I an idiot? Am I completely overlooking something painfully obvious? If anyone can help me, PLEASE DO!!!!</p>
