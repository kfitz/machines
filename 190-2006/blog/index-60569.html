    <div class="content"><p>Starting to read House of Leaves I was real excited because so many people had said it was so fantastic. When I started reading it though, I found that I never really got immersed in the story. Perhaps my attention deficit was a little too disordered by the arrangement of text in this novel. I found it difficult to go back and forth from one narrator to the next, while literally thumbing backwards and forwards through the book. I also found Zampano's story of the Navidson Record to be supremely boring. I have a tough time believing that people actually get scared by this book. When they were measuring the house and finding it to be 5/16ths of an inch bigger on the inside, i was pretty much unaffected. Too much math, not enough blood to be scary.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am not really sure what else to write about this week, so here is a general observation of mine. More and more, I find the subject material from my classes this semester interlinking and commenting or adding onto each other. And also raising nagging personal questions of mine that have long been nagging me in the back of my mind. My Metropolis class at Scripps talks about how perception changes with technology; it refers to the Industrial Revolution, but so much of it is relevant to how our understanding or perception of authorship changes as we move into postmodernism and the computer-dominated world.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have mixed feeling about the multiple narrators in House of Leaves. There are Zampano, Johnny Truant, and the Editors. But then there is also Danielewski, and, although Will Navidson does not narrate, we also follow his story. By far, I think Truant is the most interesting narrator, because we can identify him. One Internet review of the book says, "Truant has more of an semi-autobiographical feel, or at least comes closest to being the kind of guy who might be found reading Danielewski's book on the subway" (http://www.themodernword.com/review_house_of_leaves.html). He writes in a very stream-of-consciousness style and often about things that are only minimally related to the line corresponding to his footnote.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One distinct thing about House of Leaves is that it was distributed in parts over the Internet before being officially published. I think this is an interesting concept to explore. Our professor, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, did the same thing with her book, and, if I remember correctly, she said that the experience was much better than having someone edit the book later. This is because more people can view it, because of its accessibility and the smaller size of the presented chunks (as opposed to the whole book), leading to more and varied feedback.</p>
<p>I find this idea of rough draft Internet postings to be particularly interesting in questions of authorship. Although there is one central author, readers participate in the book's development, of course depending on how much the primary author takes their advice. I think also, that the author is more thoroughly conscious on what others will think of their writing. Does that detract from originality and encourage catering to others' desires? And, by the way, what if someone else steals your ideas? I'm not sure. It would be an interesting experiment to publish our theses in that way--</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Key Question:  How have photographs been distorted for political purposes throughout history?</p>
<p>Readers: Prof. Howe and Prof. Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>"A photograph is often perceived to be an unmediated copy of the real world, a trace of reality skimmed off the very surface of life." -- Sturken and Cartwright's Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture, 2001</p>
<p>In my thesis, I would like to explore and examine the ways that photographs have been used to deceive the public, specifically for political purposes.  This idea grew out of my interest in the myth of photographic truth.  This myth has persisted since the time of the medium's invention in the nineteenth century.  Louis-Jacques-MandÃ© Daguerre and William Henry Fox Talbot, both credited with discovering photographic means of creating images, portrayed photography as a factual, automatic, and completely objective process, stressing that it enabled nature to "draw herself."  Daguerre and Talbot made the photograph sound like a scientific window onto the world when, in reality, it always had the potential to deceive.  Images that defy the myth of photographic truth date back to 1839 and can be found within the work of Daguerre himself.  Nonetheless, this myth continues to persist, perhaps now more than ever.  In the digital age, computer programs like Photoshop invite and even encourage editing, manipulation, and fabrication.  People today know how easy it is to alter images.  But somehow, in spite of this awareness, the public still buys into instances of photographic fakery.  Because of this, photographs have been a powerful political tool for more than a century.  Photographic images are often read as factual--especially when presented by the government or in newsprint--which makes photography the perfect medium for convincingly deceiving the public.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So while I was doing some thesis research I happened to stumbe across a book devoted entirely to the Man with the Movie Camera. In the mood to put off thesis for a bit, I read part of it, and was able to fill in some of some missing information I didn't get when we watched the film two weeks ago. In case any of you are interested, here are some facts that caught my eye: </p>
<p>Vertov veiws documentaries as the only valid form of film and "The Man with the Movie Camera is a statemont of commitment to the documentary approach". Additionally, Vertov beleived himself to be a political filmmaker, and his objective, as he set forth in "The Birth of the Cine-Eye" was to "further the battle for the communist decoding of the world". Whoa.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, not entirely related to anything, but something interesting and hopefully preceeding more relevant material...<br />
   As some of you may or may not know, the band I'm in recently changed our name. Someone asked me at Symposium one night if I thought the new name made any difference. I immediately said it did. I felt freed as an author. The old name had come to symbolize a certain set of musical requirements, and the new one to me represents creative freedom. It symbolizes a willingness, almost a necessity, to step outside my personal boundaries of familiarity, and still somehow manages to encapsulate a more cohesive end product. My creative process has been restructured at every level by simply assigning a new name to the collective author of the final product. I'm not sure why this is, how it relates to being one author in a group of four - or seeing so many changes undergo the creative product from start to finish - or whether the old name had become an author-function representing a body of work I had outgrown...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I noticed that whenever I try to write my blog, or type i should say, my blog directly onto my computer, they end up being less of what I had intended and less of what Id hoped to present comes through. Everything, form information to my authorial voice is lost somewhere in translation. Maybe somewhere in my brain the supposed effiency that computers offer has made me less expressive when im using this particular medium. </p>
<p>So i tried somethign new, I wrote my blogs for this week on paper first, and voila. I was able to express myself more accurately My writing maynot be perfect, but i definetly think that there is a direct connection withthe return to a more organic form of hand writing that allows a less mediated me shine through.</p>

<p>Going back to Vertovs film, I admre the way in which Vertov ccreated his piece with such a great snese of filmic freedom. The fact that he so freely was able to show a burth, something that we rarely see today (cultural differences aside) is amazing. I can't helpbut think that the novelty of film during that time and the need to explore its boundaries was the cause for such freedom--the need to learn. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I'm impresses with how Vertov was able to use his film to portray his political ideas. While the film as a whole may nt neccessailry have a political  agenda, we as viewers certainly come away with a sense fo what he thought about his country during that time period--big brither was taken over. All you need to get a sense of this is the scene with the big (omniscient and omnipresent) camera (big brither) looking over the city.</p>
