    <div class="content"><p>While reading Foucault's "What Is an Author?", I found myself disagreeing and questioning some of his points and assumptions.  For instance, on p. 118, he wonders about what Sade's writings were "before he was consecrated as an author."  I believe that becoming an author does not require being "consecrated," especially in the age of the Internet, since we are all authors as we post information or contribute to discussions on the World Wide Web.  Also, he implies that everything Nietzsche contributed to the world, from references and reminder notes and laundry bills, might be included in his life's works as an author.  References and reminder notes might be uniquely Nietzsche's, but a laundry bill does not strike me as an original work, especially since someone else probably wrote it out and Nietzsche probably only signed it.  I agree more with a definition of authorship presented in Molly Nesbit's essay, found on p. 238, describing authorship as creation of "work of the mind, whatever the kind, the form of expression, the merit or the destination," ranging from literary writings to speeches and artistic creations.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Wow, I really regret not reading the Nesbit first. I honestly read the Foucault first, got a couple of interesting points out of it, but really just couldn't stand much of his philosophical ramblings. Little did I know that Barthes was even worse! Not only was he an even more abstract and dense writer, but I didn't even agree with most of what he was saying (How does the author not exist outside of his text?). Finally, though, Nesbit put all of that into perspective by informing us of the social context surrounding the two essays. Plus making some interesting points of her own. If only I had t</p>

<p>Okay--I'm very apprehensive about this blog.  </p>
<p>I'm not a blogger and I haven't had any desire to become one.  Class presentations, sharing my work in class, even having friends read my work is a highly stressful experience.  Academic work aside, posting my personal thoughts/opinions/beliefs doesn't make me feel liberated, it makes me feel exposed.  Last semester I even dropped a course because it required each student to read their response papers out loud at the start of every class (pathetic, I know).  But, I suppose I can't run from this one.  In any case, I guess it will be a "learning experience."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Barthes has an way of writing which makes me feel as if he wants to be so far separated from his "authorship" of this essay we have read. The death of the author through the reader is an idea, that in many ways makes sense. For example, tonight when we sit around and discuss the essay, by doing that without taking into account the various intericacies of Barthes and what lead him to write this essay, we essentially dismiss his presence and take the work for our own. Now this is not to say we hold any ownership of the piece, as we are just the critics, however, our individual interpretations of the work leads us to become a form of meta-author in our own right, asserting our own experiences as Foucault states, into the work we are both accessing and creating.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have been thinking of what angle to take this for some while now. At first I wasn't sure about the degree of intimacy that we were supposed to inflect on these posts, but it seems like people are getting personal, so I think I'm going to keep it moving in that direction. First of all, this is the first time I've blogged before, but I was planning on starting a blog of my own and this is the perfect catalyst for me. Like others before me, I have to say that this week was a bit too busy to get posting earlier, and I also experienced some technical difficulties.<br />
Anyways.<br />
After reading Barthes and Foucault I have to say that my conception of an author has been slightly changed. Or, better said, my conception of an author has been more informed. The romantic notion that authors write to become immortal (words never die, right?) and the way Foucault tied it to the Hero of Greek narratives (117) is interesting. However, it was much more interesting for me to read that "speeches and books were assigned real authors... only when the author became subject to punishment." (124). The struggle between cynicism and romanticism, will it ever leave human conscioussness? I don't think so. And, when Barthes writes    "the modern scriptor is born at the same time as his text" (52) his comment seems to find a balance between the two.</p>

<p>while reading nesbit's piece and how she talked about the impact of technology on notions and laws pertaining to authorship, i was wondering how would sampling fit into that? when describing the process of photographers struggling to be considered authors, she quotes Taine who said "photographic work is property; it belogs to the producer under the same title that gives the engraving to the engraver, and in the two cases, the property should be protected" (237). when a dj uses different samples in hir songs, whose property is that? there is a human process in that creation, and the samples are (at least theoretically) being used in a different context and being experienced differently. however, what makes it tricky, particularly with music, is that the samples are being experienced in the same medium though it is not the same work. the music industry in general is an interesting place to explore the realm of authorship.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In her article "What Was an Author?" Molly Nesbit spends considerable time discussing the mixing of culture and industry. I personally find this combination to be perplexing. Is it ultimately beneficial for traditional art or not? I think the main point of art is expression, and as long as that is maintained, industry-infused art does not undermine traditional art, but extends it. In Lyotard's Xerox exhibition, visitors made photocopies, but each copy was unique due to the machine's inexactitude (254). To me, this is art when viewed as such; the personal expression of the art is in the discourse surrounding it. By early French law, cultural work was defined by "the material used and the imprint of the author's personality which would follow from working in this material" (234). As I just said, the Xerox example does show personality via individual interpretation. I think the tricky part comes with pinpointing the material. Is it the Xerox copy or perhaps the verbalized ideas inspired by the copy? I would argue for the latter. Without the discourse, the industrial machine's product does not reflect any human personality. Can industry and culture be happily wedded? Yes, as long as industrial technology does not force culture to deny a fundamental part of itself, personal expression.</p>
