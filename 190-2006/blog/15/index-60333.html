    <div class="content"><p>So I was going to include this in my last blog but if you guys are anything like me, I know the more lengthy the blog, the less likely it will get read all the wa through. So... here is one more of my thoughts on television culure.  </p>
<p>Despite the more recent uproar that violence in the media has caused in Congress and legislation, sex has always been the more debated issue when it comes to censorship and regulations.  In a day and age when murder and mayhem rule the silver screen, dominate prime-time television, and grace the front page of every major news source, why is the majority of our attention always on sex?  In th article I read for class, the author, George Gerbner says in his article, "formula driven violence in entertainment and news is not an expression of freedom, viewer preference, or even crime statistics-- but rather the product of a complex manufacturing machine" In other words, violence and blood sells. He continues to say that "Sex is second but, ironically, it runs into more inhibitions and restrictions."</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>While doing some reading for my class US Popular Culture, I found some information I thought might be interesting to some fellow media majors. Anyhow, I read two articles on television violence, the first of which was in opposition to TV violence and its monopoly on popular entertainment and the second one was not so much in deffense of TV violence but rather a statement on the lack of any effective legislation for regulating TV violence other than censorship.</p>
<p>To give you a little background information on the matter, scenes of violence occur an average of 3 to 5 times per hour in prime-time dramatic fiction, and between 20 and 25 times per hour in cartoons.  The average viewer of prime-time television drama series sees in a typical week about 15 murders and an average of 150 acts of violence not including that from the news or cartoons.  For obvious reasons the question has come to the forefront of whether or not TV violence translate into real-world violence and to what extent watching violence in the media has on the public. But the problem is, how do we go abot measuring this effect.  The two articles, among other things, listed two key problems in media effects studies. The first being that it is difficult to measure long-term effects because there are few studies that are exhaustive enough to account for psychological and biological factors that no doubt have have an impact on the way in which an indivdual responds to the media. Secondly, media is often taken out of context for these studies which ignores the fact that media consumption gains its meaning through association with a range of other activities that constitute our everyday life.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am noticing a general trend in class blogging that I am surprisingly appreciating right now as I sit at a borrowed computer because mine has been displaying the blue screen of death for 2 weeks and our "RTAs" seem to be far to busy to foster an ounce of concern for the lack of technolog in the lives of unfortunate souls like myself. FICTION. That's what I was geting to. Class blogging has taken a turn towards fictiontown and I like it. Or should I say creativitytown? Bits of the truth scattered like flies in a web of lies. That rhyme was unintentional by the way. You bold ones out there blogging nonsense is really making my evening.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I loved this book. What a refreshing break from the academic essay! The best part was that I felt like I got so much more out of this book from its reader friendly format. It wasn't like the content was dumbed down at all but rather stripped clean of academic self-importance. Yeah. Great.</p>
<p>Anyway, out of the many different concepts presented in the book here were some of my favorites.  First was the concept of amplification through simplification. I felt like the book itself was a perfect example of this concept in action. In simplifying the many complex issues at hand when trying to put in to words the many possibilities inherent to the art of comics, Scott McCloud's argument was totally amplified.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So in the last HOUR that it took me to read all the latest blog posts, I was reminded of an authorship discussion I had recently in another class of mine. In my creative journalism class we had a brief discussion about ghostwriting. Though I'm sure most if not all of you know, a ghostwriter as defined by Wikipedia, "is a writer who writes under someone else's name, with their consent. Ghostwriters are often employed by celebrities to write autobiographies in situations in which the celebrities themselves may not be talented writers, or are too busy doing other work.  Many politicians also employ at least one ghostwriter to compose letters for them."</p>

Anyhow, I was reading about a girl who goes by the name of Tila Tequila who has recently been anointed the "first star of MySpace." At last count she had of 1.4 million friends and a total of 45 million views making her the most popular person on MySpace. For these oh-so fine accomplishments she has earned herself an interview on MSNBC, graced the cover of Stuff magazine, launched a clothing line, been offered a book proposal and she is now a rising hip-hop star with several of her songs topping the unsigned acts charts on MySpace.  This 25 year old Vietnamese-American girl claims to be "one of the realest girls out there."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While weaving my way through the textual labyrinth that is House of Leaves, I stumbled upon a very applicable media studies discussion.  After some discussion of the technical differences between Hollywood film and documentary film, Danielewski or should I say Zampano, or maybe Truant, I'm not quite sure, anyhow... the narrator mentions how in the past "live footage was limited to the aftermath-the oral histories given by survivors or photographs taken by pedestrians- these days the proliferation of affordable video cameras and tapes has created more of an opportunity for someone to record a plane wreck or bank robbery as it is actually taking place."  Moreover, the recent advances in video and photo technology on cell phones are making this phenomenon even more apparent.</p>

<p>Dearest Johnny,</p>
<p>They have found a way to break me. Rape a fifty six year old bag of bones. There is no worse and don't believe otherwise.</p>
<p>The attendants do it. Others do it to. Not everyday, not every week, maybe not even every month, but they do it.  Some one I don't know always comes.  When it's dark. Late. I've learned not to scream, screaming gave me hope and unanswered hope is shattered hope.  Think of your Haitain.  It is far saner to chose rape than shattered hope. So I submit and I drift.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>This week in my US Popular Culture class at Pitzer we have been discussing the advent of the television and its impact on popular culture and American society.  Iin class, I found myself virtually unable to imagine the era before television.  For so many people today, the television forms such a fundamental aspect of daily life that I think its power often goes unnoticed.  I mean, we plan meals around primetime, we arrange our furniture to accommodate for the television (which is more often than not the focal point), and we rely on the television to provide us with our daily source of news and entertainment. Though I have never been much of a TVaholic, I still find it hard to imagine life without its existence. As perhaps the most pervasive form of popular culture, it is fascinating to learn how fast and hard we all fell for the comforting glow of this monumental technological advancement.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While reading the article "Making Films Asian American," by Sarah Projansky and Kent A. Ono, I found one aspect very interesting.  The article focused alot on the economic side of cinematic production, an issue I think has been largely overlooked in other essays but nonetheless is a vital factor in this question of authorship. The article asserts that among other things, the filmmaker is "a laborer within global capitalist economy that continually masks the relationship between workers and products."  I think the economic setting in which a film or any form of cultural text is created can potentially have a huge effect on the ways in which authorship is percieved. As the article states on pg. 266, "The flight from the auteur as sanctified origin of textual meaning parallels the postmodern cultural effect of libertating products from any and all sites of production and cultural contexts...labor is alienated from the existential moment of human production and products forever circulate as exchange value versus use value."</p>
