    <div class="content"><p>Instead of doing my homework this afternoon I decided to go and see the new James Bond movie Casino Royale.  If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading this blog right now and go. I promise you a full 2 hours of entertainment. </p>
<p>While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, I couldn't help but notice the blatant use of product placement as is typical of so many movies made these days.  But there was one instance in particular that had me a little upset.  One scene features James Bond driving a new Ford coupe while on a mission in the Bahamas.  James Bond driving a Ford? Come on! Thankfully, it is just a rental car until he has the time to get his hands on a far more Bond-appropriate car, a vintage Aston Martin.  Nevertheless, I couldn't help but wonder how much Ford had to pay to get Daniel Craig behind the wheel. So I did a little research--</p>

<p>Though typically I am all for making fun of ignorant people, I draw the line with the old Jewish couple. How could you possibly take advantage of them like that and feel ok about it.  They open up their home to Borat and his crew and make them a late night snack , and what do they get in return? They are portrayed as money grubbing Jews who have morphed into cockroaches.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So this blog is definitely not one to go down in history. (Wow, I had to spell definitely five times before spell check could even register it, that is sad and pathetic.)  I have been struggling in terms of content for my blogs this week but I said I would pump out two of these babies tonight and by God, I will do it. </p>
<p>Here goes, I was doing reading for my creative journalism class and a very dim light bulb flickered in the distant reaches of my mind that it might be something I could blog about so that's what I'm gonna do.  The book I was reading is Robert's Rules of Writing, authored by my professor Robert Masello.  Despite being a clever attempt to boost book sales by making it required reading, the book is an attempt to give the reader "101 unconventional lessons that every writer needs to know."  Rule #47 Lay Down the Law, warns readers that "when you're writing, you're creating your own world on the page,and in that world you are God. So act it." The  rule cited the short-lived popularity of make your own adventure books. My professor argued that these stories failed to become a staple in publishing circles because readers don't want to have to choose their own ending. He said if readers wanted to choose what happened in a narrative they would write the book themselves.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I have recently become the owner of Beck's recently released album, The Information.  As a devoted fan and future girlfriend of Beck, I felt required to post on its awesomeness. Aside from being his best album since Odelay, Beck has outdone himself yet again on originality. </p>
<p>This part actually has to do with our class so pay attention. The Information was released as a CD/DVD combo and the DVD features a music video to accompany each song.  I read a review prior to the release of the CD which annoys me now because I can't remember where I read it and also can't remember all that Beck said about the album. However, I do remember that he said he had been wanting to do a CD/DVD combo for a long time now because he thinks that it comes closer to how we should experience music, as this totally sensationally stimulating medium. Kinda interesting in terms of our recent discussion about the level of immersion allowed by new media forms.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I just got my take home mid-term for my other media studies class and I had to share it with you.  The first half of the mid-term is pretty typical. Upon selecting a scene from a current TV show, you have to write a 2-3 page essay imagining what it would be like if you were seeing that scene 40 years ago and what would be controversial or groundbreaking about it. </p>
<p>The second half of the mid-term is a little more interesting. We have to watch a solid hour of TV and write down every ad that we see during the commercial breaks while taking brief notes about what the ad is selling, who is represented in the ad etc. Then we have to organize this list of ads into groups based on the product i.e. beer, cars etc. and then we have to organize the list into  subgroups based on what is being represented in the ad and who is the target audience.</p>

<p>The opening line of the essay was, "Are we in danger of drowning in blogorrhea? Of being swamped like Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason at the end of How to Commit Marriage in chin-high sludge?" James Wolcott says no. Giving a brief summary of the history of Web logs, Wolcott argues that blogging is heir to journalism's great traditions.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I am usually more in favor of moving forward in class bloggation than posting upon material that has already been discussed at length but  I was reminded today of something I was going to blog about in Hamlet on the Holodeck but never got around to it.</p>
<p>I was interested in Janet Murray's idea of a literary hierarchy.  At the start of Chapter 10, Hamlet on the Holodeck? on page 273, Murray returns to the question raised by Aldous Huxley, "Will the stories brought to us by the new representational technologies 'mean anything' in the same way that Shakespeare's plays mean something, or will they be 'told by an idiot'"?  She continues to say that we often assume that stories told in one medium "are intrinsically inferior to those told in another." She uses the example of Shakespeare and Jane Austen and how they were once considered to be working in less legitimate formats than those used by predecessors such as Homer.  Toda the same thing occurs much in the same way for television and cinema. As Murray says, "The very act of watching television is routinely dismissed as inherently inferior to the act of reading, regardless of content."</p>

<p>Brent Weinstein who is heading up the new division was quoted in the article as saying, "The barrier to entry is so low, everybody is now a potential artist.

    <div class="content"><p>Reading Hamlet on the Holodeck, among many things, got me thinking about the possibilities of future technology especially in the gaming industry. It seems after any new gaming system comes out I always find myself thinking that this is as good as it gets.  Game technology can advance no further than Super Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt for the original Nintendo. But then, not long after comes Mario All-Stars for the Super Nintendo, Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega, Mario Cart for N64.... And though my heart remains with, Super Mario III for regular Nintendo, game technology just just keeps getting better and better.</p>
