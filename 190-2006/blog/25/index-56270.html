<p>I think its a funny take on such a serious topic. I know everyone on these campus has been made aware of the potential for any situation going awry. SO i'm not going to blog about it. But I did think you would appreciate the video and use it to become more aware and take care of yourselves. Sometimes humor gets the point across more effectively.</p>

All I know is that when my friend came in after attending and ITS workshop for RefWOrks (she works at ITS at CMC)she showed me a time/lifesaver. For those of you that dont know, I suggest that you go to RefWorks and make an account ASAP. We may have talked about it in class already, but I believe I may have missed that day. If we havent, maybe Prof. Fitzpatrick could get someone to show the class how to use it. </p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>My original project/thesis proposal had decidedly been to broad to be able to pursue in a way that allow for me to really explore effectively. So I researched the topic regarding identity and social networking systems and I concluded that the most pertinent SNS to people my age wre MysSpace and Facebook. And I realized that both were completely different in terms of who joined and how they portrayed themselves. And then Facebook opened up to the public in an attempt to become more inclusive. And Myspace has recenetly allowed for profiles to be blocked to the public. As has facebook. So myspace is becoming more exclusive and facebook more inclusive. Is this an attempt by both to attract both people who lobe being in the public eye and people who desire a greater level of privacy? How does the interface affect the overall usage? And this is how I came to find that what really really really interests me in terms of SNS is how the differences in the type of network design and interface affect the network identities that myspace and facebook users present and how these identities in turn affect the types of connections the users' experience with each other. Do you guys think that this question is something that the average type of user asks themselves when they log on? Do you think they make a conscious effort to project a certain identity or do you think that the site design inherently affects the type of identity presented and thus the type and extent of connections made with other users?</p>

<p>While I'm all for the humane treatment of animals, does it really make sense to be paying so much more money for something that should be done anyway? I don't know much about regualtions regarding the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses, but it seems to me that it should be something that is enforced without me having to buy overpriced proucts just to be sure that these animals are not being "slaughtered." anyhow the article is interesting. </p>

<p>Sophia Lamar has beef with fellow gender benders Amanda Lepore and Jefree Star</p>
<p>Sophia Lamar (born Enrique MuÃ±oz in 1955 in Castro's Cuba) has long been a fixture of New York Night Life, starting off with Michael Alig and the original Club Kids, and now a fixture at Misshapes. She also has a weekly outlet to air her thoughts in Johnny McGovern's Gay Pimpin' podcast, where her popular segment "What Sophia Lamar Hates" ends each episode.</p>
<p>Sophia charged MySpace "e-celebrity" Jeffree Star with ripping her off. Sophia Lamar is the muse of fashion design collective Ok Citizen's Society which years ago created a shirt with the phrase "Sophia Lamar Will Kill You", and since then Sophia has adopted the phrase for her official website http://www.sophialamarwillkillyou.com. Well it seems Jeffree Star has started selling his own version of the shirt (seen here) with the phrase "Jeffree Star Will Kill You". Sophia noted how her shirt is sold in boutiques all across the world, and his is sold on myspace. She says his use of the phrase is like her saying "That's hot" or "You're Fired".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I noticed that whenever I try to write my blog, or type i should say, my blog directly onto my computer, they end up being less of what I had intended and less of what Id hoped to present comes through. Everything, form information to my authorial voice is lost somewhere in translation. Maybe somewhere in my brain the supposed effiency that computers offer has made me less expressive when im using this particular medium. </p>
<p>So i tried somethign new, I wrote my blogs for this week on paper first, and voila. I was able to express myself more accurately My writing maynot be perfect, but i definetly think that there is a direct connection withthe return to a more organic form of hand writing that allows a less mediated me shine through.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>10/10</p>
<p>Going back to Vertovs film, I admre the way in which Vertov ccreated his piece with such a great snese of filmic freedom. The fact that he so freely was able to show a burth, something that we rarely see today (cultural differences aside) is amazing. I can't helpbut think that the novelty of film during that time and the need to explore its boundaries was the cause for such freedom--the need to learn. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I'm impresses with how Vertov was able to use his film to portray his political ideas. While the film as a whole may nt neccessailry have a political  agenda, we as viewers certainly come away with a sense fo what he thought about his country during that time period--big brither was taken over. All you need to get a sense of this is the scene with the big (omniscient and omnipresent) camera (big brither) looking over the city.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>So today (10/09) we watched Man with A movie Camera in another class of mine. </p>
<p>Watching it a second time after having our class discussion really allowed for me to focus more in depth in what the movie was about. </p>
<p>Anyhow, before the movie began, my film professor mentioned that the soundtrack on the movie (the same one we listened to in our video in class) is indeed the original one that Vertov himself comisisoned to go with his movie. He wanted the music to accompany the pace of his movie. This was Vertov;s way of creating a musical ballet mechanique, or musical montage of the moving elements in his film. After watching it a second time, I was convinced that the sound in this film is of equal or greater value than the visuals because a great sound can make up for a mediocre visual. Not to mention that the way that the music was juxtaposed to the filmic action really did affect how I perceived the film. It really did, along with the changing speed of the film, make my emotions come and go in waves. Watching this film in silence  would be like watching the stabbing scene in Hitcock's Psycho minus the music--. The result would be "eh--" Music and film speed by create a unique rhythm together that Vertoov as author really took advantage of.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After some research, I pretty much have a general idea of where I want to go with the final project paper. I'm just not sure where to take it exactly.... This is what I have written down concretely so far:</p>
<p>"According to Wikipedia, a social network is understood to mean "a social structure made of nodes which are generally individuals or organizations. It indicates the ways in which they are connected through various social familiarities ranging from casual acquaintance to close familial bonds."  With the introduction of internet based social networks, formally known as a social networking services, or SNS, users are allowed to build social networks through a social software and connect to other users based on whatever interests they desire. An internet based social network allows its users to create an identity that  may either be acurate or completely inaccurate depending on what they want to portray. Additionally, the overall accessibility to a social networking service is high, therefore allowing almost anyone to join, which may or may not pose a problem in terms of privacy. What this paper will attempt to do is explore and gain a better understanding of the impact that social networking services are having on identity management issues."</p>
