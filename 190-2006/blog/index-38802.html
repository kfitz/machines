<p>As much as Mosley wanted to show that things are not black and white I think he did really set it up for Ãlvarez to win for councilman. Throughout the beginning it seemed he was made to look like the innocent, down to earth, good hearted simple man. Lucinda, on the other hand was shown as ruthless, aggressive, and far less moral than her competitor. We see her in the bus with her campaign manager and although we get a glimpse into her idealistic past we also see her do nothing as the campaign manager throws out the other girl for not wanting to lie! When Ãlvarez won, it came as no surprise.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>There is a show on CNBC right now called Game On.  It is all about how video games have evolved from their early form to the games of today.  I shall share with you the wisdom that CNBC has passed on to me.  Video games were first developed on computers.  However, at the time, With the cost of computers you would have to play a game @ 25 cents a pop, 400,000 times to even pay for the cost of the computers.  It was finally realized that televisions were the right space in which to launch the idea of on-screen gaming.  The creators of the games went to companies like RCA, trying to get their product launched.  It was Magnavox that finally picked up the idea.  Their first product failed however, largely due to poor advertising.</p>

The article said that kids, "drink twice as much soda as milk, a reverse of figures noted 20 years ago", and that "the average soda consumption among teenage males between ages 13 and 18 who drink soda is three or more cans a day, and 10% drink seven or more cans a day. Of 13- to 18-year-old girls who drink the beverages, the average intake is more than two cans a day, and 10% of those teenagers drink more than five cans a day."  It then goes on to talk about the implications for sugar intake on diabetes and obesity and how schools are implementing programs to try reduce these rates.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In Free Culture, Lawrence Lessig says that the RIAA reported 43 million Americans downloaded music illegally in May 2002 (199). In other words, 43 million Americans (or 20%) are felons. I think it's safe to say that many college students now were/are in that mix. Lessig's point? A law is more ineffective the more people violate it. When 20% of a country violate a law, that law should be considered seriously and potentially changed. He says this, and I agree.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of the 11th Commandment? "Thou shall not get caught." It's very American. Basically, anything goes as long as nobody finds out. Bill Clinton, Nixon, Carl Rove--politicians know that commandment well. That's the kind of dishonest ideology increasingly developing among Americans in recent years, and that is what Lessig means when he says, "Overregulation corrupts citizens" (199).</p>

We saw one of those many commercials that have begun springing up in which a brief part of a story is told or something and then the commercials ends with an encouragement to go visit the website for more of the story. </p>
<p>His conclusion was that this was pretty stupid. He had never followed those directions and was kind of offended that the company was making him do more of their work. If they wanted to advertise to him, they should do it on their time, not on his. Going to their website would just mean buying into their whole marketing scheme.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I decided to do more research into the launch of Playstation 3. Conclusion, it is a little insane.  My boyfriend is included in this madness though, so I suppose I can't judge too harshly. He has been outside of Target since last night, the Playstation doesn't come out until Fri morning. (don't get me started on what I think about that)</p>
<p>So here is the plan.  Go to Target today, line up, buy a Playstation then sell it on E-bay to pay for my grad school.  Anyone want to join? But then I heard that people did this with the Xbox 360 and there wasn't enough of a demand for them to really inflate the prices on e-bay.  I guess they had struggled to get their release date out before the Playstation and Nintendo and because of this there was some glitches.  Seems like there is going to be major high-powered, high-tech game system saturation to me.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Personally, I think you should all go out and rent Who Killed the Electric Car? (or put it in your Netflix queue). I was bummed when we had class and it was showing at Scripps, but it just released on DVD yesterday and I watched it this afternoon instead of writing a Spanish essay and I could not be more pleased with my decision. It is an extremely well-put together documentary that kept my attention and gave me a massive amount of information about something that I had little or no knowledge about before.<br />
Just a bit about authorship before my verdict in the murder case and other rantings. The film brought me back to issues that we discussed about Authorship and Film.  This film was written and directed by the same guy, who clearly has a passion for the topic, but he use of other materials (clips from movies, television broadcasts, etc) add a lot to the film and make it much better, so there is a blurring of authorship, like there is with many documentaries.  Also, I expected the narrator to be the voice of the director/writer and was a bit surprised when the credits rolled around to see that the voice was actually that of.... Martin Sheen. Interesting. It is also quite clear that it took a lot of people to make this film work and the authorship was a collaborative effort, rather than just the director.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Well I just got back from Tokyo, Japan where I was working on a future documentary on 50 years of videogames. The Playstation 3 launched there earlier there this week and me and my crew of two others were literally the first on the scene as hundreds of people had lined up for hours to get their hands on the new console. Well, we showed up at 4am and to say the least, it was intense. We were able to get a bunch of interviews with people standing on line (and the first guy to actually purchase one) and met some very interesting people. Some guys actually flew from the UK just to get one of the 90K that were sold on the 11th.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Sometimes I hate computers... I just wrote this really long blog about this and accidentally hit the back button and lost it all. Anyway, I'll try again and it probably won't be nearly as well written since I have class in 10 minutes, but oh, well. </p>
<p>I recently heard that O.J. Simpson has turned author.  However, his writing is not a straight up autobiography or anything like that.  He wrote a hypothetical book about how he would have killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, had he done it.  Not really a confession, yet not really a good way of clearing his name.  In addition, he has taped an interview that will air at the end of the month that goes over the material in the book, describing how he would have executed the murders. Anyway, my initial reaction was mortification.  How can he write the gruesome details about how he would have killed his ex-wife and the mother of his children even if he had?? Doesn't he have a soul?  While this feeling still remains strong, I started thinking... he just wants to be back in the spotlight and this is a pretty unique and crazy way to get back in the spotlight.  He can't be charged for the crimes again, so why not hypothetically confess?? Other people wrote a million books about the trial and speculated what happened, why shouldn't O.J. author his own book and clear up exactly what happened?</p>
