    <div class="content"><p>I've been meaning to blog about this for a while now, but life just keeps getting in the way. Really who would have thought that blogging would be so hard? So constraining? You would think it would be one of the easiest, most liberating parts of class. No dice. Huh--</p>
<p>Anyway, this post is not about blogging, despite outward appearances, it's about TV. I've been getting DVDs of television series on my Netflix lately because I discovered that I almost never have two hours of consecutive free time in which to watch a movie any more. Lately I've been watching <em>Samurai Jack</em>, the Cartoon Network animated series. I don't know how many of you have seen it. If you've only seen one or two episodes, you probably don't have all that high opinion of it and I can't say I blame you, but watched as a whole it's pretty damn cool and I'll tell you why!</p>

It's only 30 pages or so and it's pretty interesting. Alot of it has to do with her visions of future media and technology, so while you're reading the section be thinking about what she got right, what she got wrong, what might still happen and what probably won't, and why. Also try to think of your own examples of possible future media.</p>

I have found one source of helpful information, so for anyone wanting to know more about jobs and graduate programs in Media Studies there's <a href="http://www.screensite.org/"> SCREENSITE</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that I was wondering if anyone knew anything about grad programs in Media Studies. Even with SCREENSITE, it's hard to find what I'm looking for. While MFA/MA programs in practical Media Studies seem to have proliferated, I'm having some difficulty finding Ph.D. programs in Critical Media Studies. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I have Net Flix and lately I haven't had time for movies, I mean since when do I actually have over an hour of concurrent free time that isn't sleep? So instead I've been getting lots of TV shows from them. The problem is I've burned through most of the Simpsons and all of the Futurama that they have, plus a couple of crazy anime series (Serial Experiments Lain fucked with my head in a way similar to House of Leaves), so I'm beginning to look more at live action TV series. I tried <em>Sex and the City</em>, can't stand it. <em>Desperate Housewives</em> was even worse. I hate cop/law dramas, so that counts a lot out, and unlike most people I know I hate both <em>Seinfeld</em> and <em>Friends</em>. I've been told I should try <em>Monk</em> and <em>House MD</em>, I've seen a few episodes randomly and they seem promising. But that's beside the point. Anyway, last night was one of my biggest strikeouts yet. I took Net Flix and a couple of my friends up on their suggestion that I try </em>Weeds</em>, thinking, "oh this will be fun, light-hearted, maybe even a little counter cultural". I made it through the first episode, put it back in its mailer and sent it back, the worst run of any series yet. I mean no offense to anyone who likes <em>Weeds</em> or any of the other of the aforementioned TV shows. Many people that I like and respect like at least one, if not more of them, I'm just really picky about TV. But I mean really!</p>

<p>As I mentioned in our opening class I'm planning to write my thesis on and in the attempt to re-theorize public art. As I have also mentioned, Banksy was part of my inspiration to do this. Spring before last, when he put his paintings up in NYC museums I was grabbed by his fanciful problematization of the museum system (and his concurrent anti-war messages). I decided to write my final paper for Media Theory on the political efficacy of public art, with a particular emphasis on what I dubbed "ephemeral public art" (i.e. Banksy, Guerilla Girls, ACT Up, Think Again, etc.) I very quickly discovered that while there was no end to critical debate on the relative virtues of Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc" and the questions that it brought to light (primarily what should public art be? does it have to be aesthetically accessible to everyone? should it be art for art's sake or something more? and so forth), there was very little, if any, critical attention given to the very forms of public art that I was most interested in. With a limited time line and a 20 page limit, I did the best I could to discuss ephemeral public art with the resources available; however, it left me wholly unsatisfied.</p>
