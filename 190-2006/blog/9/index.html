    <div class="content"><p>but I'm 8 post short....so...you know</p>
<p>So my girlfriend got <em>D.E.B.S</em> for us on Netflix, in that, "hey come on, I know it will be bad, but it could be fun, right?" sort of way and I was completely like "Oh my god, we can not watch this, like, fo'reals" but she prevailed, as often happens and we watched the movie.</p>
<p>And you know what? It wasn't actually horrible.<br />
I mean it is in no way a "good movie"<br />
It's a piece of crap, the sound quality is bad and the plot is laughable.</p>
<p>Only two things save it:<br />
1) It doesn't take itself seriously and you can tell,<br />
which is all important for bad movies. If they know they're bad and revel in their badness you can kinda be like "ok, I'll go there with you"<br />
2) No one got reclaimed as a heterosexual,<br />
which has got to be probably my biggest pet peeve with any movie that even flirts with queer content</p>
<p>For anyone who thinks they might actually see the movie *snort* and doesn't want me to ruin it, stop reading, for those who are as morbidly fascinated as I was, read on.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've always felt that the US war on drugs was grievous waste of time and money. Furthermore, I deplore the way in which we've exported our Puritanical beliefes and policy (as well as our hypocritical glorification of parts of drug culture) on the matter to the rest of the world. Anyone who hasn't seen the documentary <em>Grass</em> absolutely should, it's really interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101654.html?nav=rss_email/components"> Anyway, here's an interstesting article on US involvement in Afghan opium production</a></p>
<p>Turns out this has been a record year. Afghanistan produces a vast amount of the world's opium and therefore is responsible for the majority of the heroine in circulation. Although it was one of the US's explicit goals to decrease opium production in Afghanistan, it would seem that it's been expanding rapidly. While certian goverment officials would like to blame this on the Taliban, it seems that unseating the Taliban directly contributed to the increase. Where opium production was outlawed under the Taliban governement, and the ban was fairly well enforced (mind you I don't support the Taliban, I'm just saying that  it's clear that they aren't responsible for the opuim production) the production has nearly doubled since Hamad Karzai took office. Furthermore, nearly a third of the country's GDP is dependent on opium production and large scale destruction of the crops could result in severe destabilization for the already troubled country.</p>
<p>It's a really intersting article. You should read it.</p>

It's a work in progress and I intend to continue adding to it. I plan to use it in my thesis presentation, provided I get approval to persue an Honors thesis (fingers crossed).</p>
<p>So I'd really like feedback. On the interface, on the content, whatever comes to mind. I'd also love suggestions for other public artworks to include.</p>

&gt; How would you define "public"?<br />
&gt; How would you define "in public"?<br />
&gt; How would you define "the public"?<br />
&gt; What is your favorite piece of public art and why?<br />
&gt; Is there such thing as  public artist or just artist who work in public (elaborate)?</p>

So she came over and brought her fiance and his friend. We were mostly playing video games and carrying on three conversations at once when my friend spotted my girlfriend's cell phone. It's one of those sleak, new "music phones". My friend immediately began to exclaim over the phone's cuteness and coolness, etc. She asked if my girlfriend had downloaded any music, which she hadn't because she didn't know how. So my friend brought out her phone to show her. My friend's phone, which she was given by a well-off friend who trades her's in every few months, was one of those cell/camera/mp3 player phones that flips open to reveal a larger screen, speakers, and a full qwerty keyboard. My girlfriend and I excalimed over the "sick"ness of her phone and she proceeded to extoll it's failings. Next thing I know everyone in the room had their phones out. Martinez (friend of fiance) was attempting to bluetooth his Razr to my friend's Sidekick to give her his ringtones, my friend was demonstrating to my girlfriend how to download media onto her phone, and fiance and I were comiserating about the realitve lameness of our phones.</p>

Don't get me wrong, I do believe there is great value in being disturbed. I just sometimes wonder how effective things like that are. I mean I feel like I'm pretty sensitive to racial stuff and pretty aware of white hegemonies and stuff like that. In my case he's kinda preaching to the choir, and making me uncomfortable in the process, so not so effective on that level. And then what about the people who aren't already in the proverbial choir? How likely are they to watch a film called Melting Pot or RACE? I'm just not sure what the goal of that film was.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Having realized just how little downtime I'd been giving myself and the fact that I'd been neglecting my girlfriend horribly, I decided to do something I hadn't done in a long time, watch a movie.</p>
<p>We got <em>Imagine Me &amp; You</em> through Netflix, and I was skeptical. The Netflix description said:</p>
<p><cite>In this delightful romantic comedy that gives new meaning to the term cold feet , bride-to-be Rachel (Piper Perabo) is love-struck ... but not with her groom. Instead, as she's marching down the aisle with her longtime sweetheart, Heck (Matthew Goode), Rachel is immediately bewitched by a beautiful guest (Lena Headey). Now, the newlywed must choose between the safety of a familiar relationship and her heart's true desire.</cite></p>
<p>Not a lot in the description and I wasn't sure if it was going to be bad or <em>really</em> bad, but the girlfriend had put it on the queue so I figured we'd watch it.</p>
<p>It turned out to be pretty good, considering it was a romantic comedy (a genre I do not have the highest esteem for). It managed to avoid most, if not all, of the major pitfalls of any movie focused around a lesbian relationship. <strong>(warning spoilers below, if you actually think you'll ever watch the movie and don't want me to spoil the ending, stop reading now!)</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, I will herein discuss, not the salient points of the reading, but a stylistic element that stuck out to me, namely Manovich's use of "she" as the generic pronoun. I am not sure if Manovich is a man/woman/other/unspecified, I had the impression that Lev was a male name, but I'm not totally sure, but I find the unmarked use of "she" as the generic to be an interesting one.</p>
