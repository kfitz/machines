    <div class="content"><p>I want to preface this by saying that I think that our country's stance on the matter of illegal substances is terribly misguided, I think that DARE does a lot more damage than good, and that the FDA and DEA are clearly more interested in regulating private citizen's personal morality on the basis of a highly conservative, fundamentalist Christian-oriented, and over-all misinformed perception of the dissemination, use, and effects of most so-called "narcotics" and controlled substances than in the protection of the citizenry. The FDA is a powerhouse of hegemonic regulation of "controlled substances", not only does it directly control what substances can and can not be legally sold and how and in what quantities, etc. but it also controls what sort of research can be done on controlled substances. You can't research their effects without obtaining the substance and you can not legally and ethically obtain it for a viable research experiment without going through the FDA, which categorically refuses to give clearance or supplies to any proposed research with the intent or potential to disprove the governmental and departmental stance on controlled substances. They not only control the substances but the knowledge that can be generated in regards to them.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm too tired to come up with a witty title...or even a relevant one.<br />
So I'll progress directly to my response to the reading.</p>
<p>I feel like there was a lot going on here, a lot being said, and a lot of different angles being taken on the same basic question. However, very little of it stood out to me. Maybe I read the wrong chapters, sadly I did not have the time to read every chapter in the book. However, the one thing that did really grab my eye (maybe because it occurred early in the book before my mind became completely oversaturated with endless permutations of author and auteur) was Janet Staiger's discussion of the "issue of agency in authorship" (51). Questions of agency are among the most interesting to me. I've gotten the impression that I give a lot more thought to my own personal agency and the ways in which it is affected in social interactions and the ways in which I can preserve a sense of it, even in the face of disempowering situations.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have to admit finding two things to talk about every week, beyond the readings, that are interesting to us, that nevertheless have to do with authorship seems a little daunting to me. I don't even update my personal blog this often and I can say whatever I want there (in fact my personal blog is suffering greatly at the hands of this blog. I don't think I've updated since the class started).</p>
<p>However I do have something I want to direct all your attention to becasue I feel like everyone needs to be made aware, and I've been really dissappointed by the responses I've been getting from other people when I try to draw their attention to this. They all tell me that they're just doing their job and how can I criticize someone when my criticism basically comes down to "they're doing their job too well". I'm talking about PSYOP. This, my friends is the Board of Shadowy FIgures behind the Evil Empire.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I know I should have asked this before, but it's been a really busy week and I *thought* I had the right readings. Like atleast one other person, I printed out the Marchessault and the Manovich becuause they were the only readings posted that we hadn't already done. It occured to me belatedly that "Forms" seemed a little out of place. So I consulted the syllabus and upon discovering that we were supposed to have read bell hooks I started looking frantically for it. But I can't find it. Am I an idiot? Am I completely overlooking something painfully obvious? If anyone can help me, PLEASE DO!!!!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Although the bit about Fruedian psychoanalysis and the relation of authorship and imagination to the Oedipal drive probably got me the most riled up out of anything in the Marchessault reading, I feel that anything I would try to say about it would only come out as angry Frued-bashing babel, which, while satisfying, is not very productive.</p>
<p>Instead I will turn my attention to a passage that interested (rather than angered) me. It has long been my primary critique of second-wave feminism that it has a tendency to essentialize and polarize along the lines the two-gender system as badly as the patriarchal establishment does. Granted for different purposes and with different intents, but, as we discussed in relation to the Barthes, purpose and intent are only important to the degree that they are succesfully communicated. Therefore, despite all intents toward empowerment through solidarity, I continue to take issue with the way in which many second-wave feminists seem to presuppose a two-gender system in which all individuals identify wholly and completely with one or the other category and who's self-catagorization will inherently link up with their social catagorization.</p>
<p>But back to the reading....</p>

As I would rather not spend all of my time copy/pasting into Word to check my spelling, I hope that you all will agree that a few mispelled words do not discredit someone's overarching arguments, and that you will not waste any of our time by commenting on my blog to inform me that I have mispelled something.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm really behind this week. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of work that's carrying over from the summer that I'm still trying to finish up, on top of new senior responsibilities I never guessed existed, plus current jobs, plus adjusting to classes. Still hammering out the schedule.<br />
Excuses, excuses...<br />
I still haven't worked out how to get into Sakia to get the readings. I know I should have gotten on this before, but I've had so much else going on that somehow it just didn't happen, the way those things do. Can anyone give me any suggestions on getting into Sakia? I tried my Network login. I tired this login. No such luck. I've emailed IT but I don't expect a reply until it's too late because isn't that IT for you?</p>
