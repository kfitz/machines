 <title>ipod musings</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/584</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;With much resistance at first, I have now succumbled fully to the ipod revolution. I was really put off my the advertisements at first. in the Bay Area, at some BART (Subway-like public transportation) stations, the platforms would be covered with IPOD ads. You couldn&#039;t go anywhere without seeing those  Even though there are definite faults (it&#039;s expensive, the battery-life is ridiculously not what they advertise, etc.), I love my ipod. it&#039;s just crazy to have so much of my music available at once. I used to carry my discman everywhere with me, and would have a cd case that could hold 10 CDs. I&#039;d carefully pick my selections before going out, etc. so having it all easibly accessible in this tiny little thing was awesome. I even have ipod accessories, such as portable speakers. my ipod allegiance is pretty pricey though for me it&#039;s been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>buying music</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/583</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;with all the stuff we&#039;ve been reading about piracy, downloads, p2p, this made me start thinking about my own music consumption habits. when I was younger, i was obsessed with collecting cds, for any birthday or christmas present I would ask people for CDs. Though I downloaded music, and would burn CDs from my friends or from the local public library (surprisingly good collection), I still ended up spending lots of money on buying CDs. I guess it was because when I was burning from others, that limited who I could listen to to artists other people had (Whom may not be the ones I&#039;m interested in). With downloading, it was easiest to download who was the most popular. More obscure bands were difficult to find. Also, it may have been easy to download a few songs, but it was harder to find complete album using different P2P software. possible, but it took work. I also had some sort of code of ethics in what I would download or burn. For example, there were certain artists who I absolutely had to buy their album and not just have a burned copy. Movie soundtracks and other compilations I burned with no hesitance, because since they weren&#039;t albums and put together cohesively for artistic purposes&lt;/p&gt;
