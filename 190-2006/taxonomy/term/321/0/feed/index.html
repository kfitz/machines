 <title>Hackers</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/632</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently someone hacked into the database at UCLA and stole personal identity information for potential identity theft. While it scares me in the first place to have my credit card and social security information in databases and on the internet, I recently had an unsettling experience concerning databases and the internet. I got a letter in the mail from this online company that I had bought something from online. Apparently someone breached the security of their online database and stole thousands of names, addresses and their corresponding credit card information. Mine was a part of this database so they told me to check over all my credit card statements, inform my credit card company and accept their apology.  While I don&#039;t know much about hacking or really even computers in general, I was pissed at this company for not taking the proper security measures to protect their databases and their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Virtual Earth</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/493</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same Newsweek I just posted about, there was another article about the internet in the 3rd dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article was specifically about Microsoft&#039;s &#039;Virtual Earth 3-D.&#039; This is a site that is being developed currently, and is available but not complete (nor will it be for quite some time). Essentially, the site is similar to Google Earth, but seems more concerned with creating a video-game style landscape. This virtual world only consists of 15 cities at the moment, but they hope to add 100 cities by summer 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specific purpose for Virtual Earth 3-D other than it&#039;s really cool. Some people in class said that they liked the game Myst because they could just explore the beauty of the world. This technology offers that same possibility, except the world is OUR world, and the exploration can be for a better purpose than beating a game. In the magazine, they offer examples such as, if you can&#039;t remember the name of the bar you love in Baltimore, you can just go there, and read the sign on the front of the place. This also has the possibility of working as a Mapquest on steroids. Not only can it tell you where to turn, but you could actually SEE the turns as well as any landmarks that could help you. This means that the only excuses for getting lost ever again would be tehnophobia or stupidity. Im sure it will be many years before this technology encompasses the whole US, let alone the world. And it will be longer still until it is made to be user-friendly in practical ways, but still, i think this is pretty exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Computer Withdrawl</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/492</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My computer crashed last week, and I&#039;m just now starting to realize how much I&#039;m in withdrawl.  I find myself coming home late at night and not knowing what to do before I fall asleep, since I can&#039;t watch a movie or a TV show on my computer.  I find myself wondering who&#039;s emailed me lately but unable to conveniently check.  I find myself waking up in the morning with a hankering to listen to a particular song but unable to, since I don&#039;t have access to my iTunes.  I can&#039;t even charge my iPod while my computer&#039;s broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m addicted, and it&#039;s sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leaves me with this question: does technology improve our lives, or does it make everything a little more complicated (especially when we&#039;re detached from that technology)?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Intro to Computer Science</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/294</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m still in the earlier parts of the book, but I&#039;ve had some thoughts already regarding much of what Murray has been saying. Some background first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m taking Intro to Comp Sci mostly to fulfill an Area Requirement, but also because it counts toward Media Studies major requirements. Initially, I thought, &quot;Really? That doesn&#039;t make any sense!&quot; except for the fact that computers are a form of media, but we had never really discussed a theory of computers (that I recall) in any of my previous theory classes. As I explain to people who are as incredulous as I that I&#039;m taking this class, I&#039;m often met with similar reactions and frequently have to justify it. Sometimes it&#039;s hard. Because of the department&#039;s association with the Math department, it&#039;s prettyer similar to a math class. There&#039;s a lot of analytical thinking required and much of programming language (with which I am not at all well acquainted) is fairly obtuse. Additionally I had a real crisis of faith today after receiving a pretty terrible grade on my midterm exam. Why am I doing this, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
