 <title>Guttlesohn Falls, Wisconsin</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of perusing Facebook, I don&#039;t know if any of you have come across this before, but there is an entire fake community created by Harvey Mudd kids of people from Guttlesohn Falls, Wisconsin. It&#039;s difficult to describe, but all the pictures are like old daguerrotypes from the 1800s and they&#039;ve got ridiculous names like Thatcher Worthington Guttlesohn. They&#039;ve created groups like the Guttlesohn Falls Rotary and the Guttlesohn Falls Hunting Club. It&#039;s an entire false reality that they&#039;ve been able to realize through the virtual social networking tool that is Facebook. I definitely recommend that everyone go check this out, because they have been so diligent and thorough about it. I&#039;ve thought about joining their community, since there are dozens of them, but for some reason it feels really wrong to try that. It seems like a well-defined space, but I know that anytime I want to I could join it and no one would know/be able to stop me. It&#039;s a really cool idea, and if any of you are involved, mad props to you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was resistant against Facebook at first, I still am slightly, but I am getting over it.  I feel like social networking is there for you to engage with it at any level.  That is what is great about it.  Either you can turn it into a major source of communication, one that you rely on for social interaction (of some form) ,or you can just put up a profile and check it once every two months when really you just want to stalk someone.&lt;br /&gt;
I did however witness an instance this week in which I saw proof of the benefits of social networking in terms of making ones academic life easier through quick and easy access to friends.  I am in a research methods class for Psychology and we have to conduct these surveys. It is really about all we do in that class.  So I put my big&#039;ol survey together and was like, &quot;cool, now I just have to go give it out&quot;.  Right yeah, that took forever, I was sweating by the end of my three hour jaunt to get like 50 survey&#039;s filled out.  So anyways, I talk with my friend Sean, and he says, &quot;oh I just put my survey on line and sent out an invite on facebook&quot;.  He had around100 responses after just two hours of it being up.  Imagine that, life made easy by a computer.  I think that something like that shows the benefits of having social networks like facebook.  By just sending the survey out to all of his networked friends he was both being less invasive than I was going door to door and getting more responses.  I can see how this type of access could be helpful on many academic and professional levels.  So perhaps while facebook might be hindering some scantily clad drunkard users from getting jobs, I think it has the potential to be helpful in many other respects.&lt;/p&gt;
