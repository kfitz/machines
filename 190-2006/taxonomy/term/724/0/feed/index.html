 <title>The Emperor&#039;s New Postmodern Clothes</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/607</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was reading this book called Making Sense of Media the other day, and stumbled upon an essay called &quot;A Postmodern Perspective on Madonna&quot; by a professor at Amherst. It starts off, &quot;In the works of Madonna, a predominant concept is the concept of textual consciousness. It could be said that the primary theme of the works of Madonna is not, in fact, discourse, but subdiscourse--&quot; I&#039;m reading the article as I usually read things with the word &quot;postmodern&quot; in their title and I&#039;m thinking, hmmm-- yeah, I guess I can see that, wait, let me read that one more time, hmmm, maybe once more, yes, I agree with that, what is she saying here? Ok, let&#039;s figure it out. Ohhh, right right right. I get to the end of the article though, and I see I have been completely duped!!! It wasn&#039;t even a real essay. It was written by something called a &quot;Postmodern Generator&quot; which apparently &quot;creates essays that seem, at first glance, reasonable, but turn out to be unintelligible&quot;. So I guess it turns out that what I thought were just incredibly convoluted sentence structure and ideas (a bad habit that all postmodern authors just so happened to have a habit of) is actually a systematic form of backward, unintelligible writing that they are TRYING to achieve! The essay I read is just making fun of the fact that a few philosophers, media theorists, cultural critics, etc. have created such a ridiculous form of writing that a generator can produce a &quot;postmodernist&quot; essay just as easily. Go to http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo and the first thing that pops up will be an essay created by a postmodern generator. Here&#039;s the one I got:&lt;/p&gt;
