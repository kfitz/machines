 <title>I&#039;m just going to start typing</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/522</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m not really sure what point I&#039;m going to make with this, but I feel that there is one, so I&#039;m just going to type pretty much as fast as I can and see what comes out (other than typos). And if any of you can think of a good point to add to this, then please be my guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Anyway, I was up in Petaluma, north of San Francisco over the Thanksgiving break, spending some time with my aunt. She&#039;s a screenwriter/story consultant, who just got out of a couple-year-long gig with a public access television station up there. She&#039;s trying to start up projects and whatnot and has decided that mySpace is the way to do it. Her being of my parents&#039; generation, she is not as familiar with recent technological advances, and enlisted me as her mySpace tutor for an afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
