 <title>insert witty title here</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/98</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m too tired to come up with a witty title...or even a relevant one.&lt;br /&gt;
So I&#039;ll progress directly to my response to the reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like there was a lot going on here, a lot being said, and a lot of different angles being taken on the same basic question. However, very little of it stood out to me. Maybe I read the wrong chapters, sadly I did not have the time to read every chapter in the book. However, the one thing that did really grab my eye (maybe because it occurred early in the book before my mind became completely oversaturated with endless permutations of author and auteur) was Janet Staiger&#039;s discussion of the &quot;issue of agency in authorship&quot; (51). Questions of agency are among the most interesting to me. I&#039;ve gotten the impression that I give a lot more thought to my own personal agency and the ways in which it is affected in social interactions and the ways in which I can preserve a sense of it, even in the face of disempowering situations.&lt;/p&gt;
