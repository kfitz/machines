 <title>Vertov&#039;s A man with a movie camera</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/209</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So today (10/09) we watched Man with A movie Camera in another class of mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching it a second time after having our class discussion really allowed for me to focus more in depth in what the movie was about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, before the movie began, my film professor mentioned that the soundtrack on the movie (the same one we listened to in our video in class) is indeed the original one that Vertov himself comisisoned to go with his movie. He wanted the music to accompany the pace of his movie. This was Vertov;s way of creating a musical ballet mechanique, or musical montage of the moving elements in his film. After watching it a second time, I was convinced that the sound in this film is of equal or greater value than the visuals because a great sound can make up for a mediocre visual. Not to mention that the way that the music was juxtaposed to the filmic action really did affect how I perceived the film. It really did, along with the changing speed of the film, make my emotions come and go in waves. Watching this film in silence  would be like watching the stabbing scene in Hitcock&#039;s Psycho minus the music--. The result would be &quot;eh--&quot; Music and film speed by create a unique rhythm together that Vertoov as author really took advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
