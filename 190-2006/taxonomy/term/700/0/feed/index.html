 <title>Addicted to Addiction</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/593</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&quot;ve just spent the last two hours watching the A&amp;amp;E series called Intervention - and wow it may have just become my new obsession as much as it disturbs me. I have yet to decide how I feel ethically about the show. I should explain the premise briefly, so that y&#039;all understand the disturbing depths of the concept. They find someone who agrees to be on a show about addiction (I think that&#039;s all their told), then they have their lives taped for a few weeks or so, then they are thrust into an unexpected intervention - all under the watchful eye of the camera. You see a girl looking for tricks to turn in order to buy heroin, an ex-ceo crying in his storage unit that contains his only remaining possessions, a middle-aged alcoholic falling out of her car. It is intimate to say the least. Actually, I&#039;m pretty sure that it is downright exploitative. At times it&#039;s almost uncomfortable to be watching these so intensely personal moments, but you can&#039;t look away at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
