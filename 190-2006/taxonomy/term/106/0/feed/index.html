 <title>Woo Hoo</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/125</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just watched an amazing movie entitled &quot;Face/Off&quot;.  It stars John Travolta and Nicholas cage in what might be the awesome height of their careers.  It involves doctors taking the face....off.  (The term &quot;Face...off&quot; is overly used in the film to the point of self-masichism and punching anyone who is within punching distance in the face.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, this marvelous work of film was directed by the One and Only John Woo.  I happened to notice that, in one of the scenes, there are doves fluttering around a church, often framed in slow motion flapping their wings across the screen.  This also happens in John Woo&#039;s Mission Impossible II.  This makes me wonder if the dove/white bird thing is a John Woo signature, and whether or not that makes him an &quot;auteur&quot;.  John Woo is well known for action films, but is that enough to make him an esteemed &quot;auteur&quot;?  What about his tendency for slow motion?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Studying the auteur</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/124</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first paragraph of the article, &quot;making films asian american&quot; Projasky and Ono state, &quot;few continue to write of the auteur as the originary and privileged location of a text&#039;s meaning.&quot; They continue, saying that, &quot;film studies scholars now avoid modernist auteurship studies&quot;. I had not previously connected the idea of the death of the author to films before, but looking back, it seems odd I took an entire class on the autuer and not once did the problem of the author arise. The class was titled &quot;American Film Directors: Kubrick, Cassavetes, and Altman&quot; and revered the three.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>making films asian american</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/113</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week&#039;s bell hooks essay discussed the fine line between African American authors becoming defined by broad stereotypes of African American culture, and dismissing or distancing themselves from the identity completely.  &quot;Making Films Asian American&quot; touches on the same issue, asking whether Asian American filmmakers can push the boundaries of categorized &quot;Asian American low-budget cinema&quot; while resisting the crossover to mainstream (white) hollywood cinema.  Projansky and Ono quote Roddy Bogawa&#039;s essay, &quot;An(other) Reflection on Race?&quot;: &quot;For artists of color, expectations of what their work should investigate simultaneously dictate what the work should not explore...They construct Asian-American filmmaking as a uniform practice, ignoring the diverse complexities of each film and each filmmaker.  Their function is to stereotype, control, and marginalize&quot; (277).  Still, Asian American filmmakers who wholly resist definition as Asian Americans compromise an important part of their identity: &quot;[Peter X. Feng] notes that Asian and Asian American filmmakers tend to cross over to relatively big-budget Hollywood pictures only when they &quot;have either submerged their Asian identities to make films about white Americans or have added Asian &#039;flavor&#039; to Hollywood films&quot; (265).&lt;/p&gt;
