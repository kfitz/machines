 <title>Because everybody loves a blog about videogames...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening slash watching the ABC news podcast on itunes the other day and there was a brief segment about a photographer by the name of Philip Toledano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toledano, an artist out of New York City has recently completed a series of photos taken of people playing video games. Being a huge gamer himself, Toledano said he had noticed that while people are playing video games, they display these extraordinary emotions and reactions that you don&#039;t normally see. In addition, some people exhibit these somewhat abnormal ticks when they become completely immersed in a video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he so appropriately says on his website, &quot;I wanted to take portraits of people that would reveal a hidden part of their character. So I had them play video games.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
