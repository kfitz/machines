 <title>Experience and &quot;authenticity&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/49</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I wrote about half a blog earlier today and then went to class, etc-- When I got back, I found that my computer had decided to install updates, restart, and wipe out my document. So this is take 2--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I liked the Marchessault reading, it expressed a lot of the issues I had with the readings from last week. I find it interesting that the author be declared dead in a historical moment when more and more marginalized people were starting to write/gain access to the literary establishment. While I wasn&#039;t necessarily on board with the Freudian stuff, I enjoyed her discussion women&#039;s writing and feminist culture. Marchessault critiques the idea that there is one authentic &quot;women&#039;s experience,&quot; but also recognizes that experience is important, in a pluralistic, non-essentializing manner. In this, I saw a lot of parallels to &quot;Postmodern Blackness&quot;. Hooks recognizes the validity of personal experience while also suggesting that postmodernism may be a way to disrupt the idea of an &quot;authentic&quot; black experience. One of my favorite quotes from the Marchessault was, &quot;The death of the author carries no political affectivity for feminist struggles precisely because it supports our violent exclusion from the public sphere&quot; (89). Both writers are concerned with the exclusion of marginalized people from culture and the act of cultural production, and how they might begin to enter that discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
