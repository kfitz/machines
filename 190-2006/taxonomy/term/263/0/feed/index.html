 <title>Random thoughts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/251</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A very random mixture of my current thoughts-- they are all somewhat media studies related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I go to blog about something non-book of the week related, I always first think of celebrity gossip.  I sometimes read this sports writers column, The sports guy.  In order to get NFL game picks out of his wife he had to promise her an unedited paragraph on his column.  Guess what she writes about in his heavily read column, celebrity gossip.  Do you think that celebrity gossip is a gendered thing?  Here is a man writing his masculine sports column and his wife chipping in her feminine celebrity gossip.   It makes for an interesting juxtaposition.&lt;/p&gt;
