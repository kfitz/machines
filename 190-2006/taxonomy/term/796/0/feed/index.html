 <description>&lt;p&gt;South Dakota Democratic Senator was hospitalized earlier today. That reminds me of the slew of conservative senators and preachers who have recently fallen out of the closet. There&#039;s really nothing I enjoy more than a tearful apology, no kidding.&lt;br /&gt;
	Take Ted Haggard. That guy really sucks. He&#039;s spent his life telling gay people that they&#039;re going to hell moments before killing them. Now, he&#039;s the gayest man in America, and he still won&#039;t admit he&#039;s full of &quot;it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	And look at Paul Barnes, another poor guy, a gay evangelist who &quot;struggled with homosexuality since [he] was a 5-year-old boy [who on countless nights] cried [himself] to sleep, begging God to take this away.&quot; Poor everyone. Why can&#039;t parents and societies just stop torturing their children for a change? Is it that hard?&lt;/p&gt;
