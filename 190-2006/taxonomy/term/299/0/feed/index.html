 <description>&lt;p&gt;While doing some reading for my class US Popular Culture, I found some information I thought might be interesting to some fellow media majors. Anyhow, I read two articles on television violence, the first of which was in opposition to TV violence and its monopoly on popular entertainment and the second one was not so much in deffense of TV violence but rather a statement on the lack of any effective legislation for regulating TV violence other than censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you a little background information on the matter, scenes of violence occur an average of 3 to 5 times per hour in prime-time dramatic fiction, and between 20 and 25 times per hour in cartoons.  The average viewer of prime-time television drama series sees in a typical week about 15 murders and an average of 150 acts of violence not including that from the news or cartoons.  For obvious reasons the question has come to the forefront of whether or not TV violence translate into real-world violence and to what extent watching violence in the media has on the public. But the problem is, how do we go abot measuring this effect.  The two articles, among other things, listed two key problems in media effects studies. The first being that it is difficult to measure long-term effects because there are few studies that are exhaustive enough to account for psychological and biological factors that no doubt have have an impact on the way in which an indivdual responds to the media. Secondly, media is often taken out of context for these studies which ignores the fact that media consumption gains its meaning through association with a range of other activities that constitute our everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
