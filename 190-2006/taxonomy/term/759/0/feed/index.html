 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just got back from the most entertaining conversation at dinner. Well, it was necessarily entertaining, but it really was thought-provoking and involved three members of our Seminar and one Philosophy major. It started when I referred to the person who will be living next door to me next semester as a &quot;rando&quot;, short for &quot;random person&quot; since it was not by our design that he will be living there. This word was not my own invention, but it is one of my favorites and thus I use it as much as humanly possible. We then collectively realized that this is a trend in our contemporary culture - shortening words from their original forms, as in &quot;poss&quot; for &quot;possibly&quot;; &quot;whatevs&quot; for &quot;whatever&quot;; &quot;sitch&quot; for &quot;situation&quot;; &quot;probs&quot; for &quot;probably&quot;; and I have no idea how to even begin spelling the modification for &quot;usual&quot; but I&#039;m pretty sure you know what it sounds like.&lt;/p&gt;
