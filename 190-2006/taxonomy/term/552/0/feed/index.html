 <title>Yr Colonial Fantasy?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/481</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Like my previous blog, this one was also sparked by my Digital Art class (yay for class overlap!). We had a visiting artist last week who did a lecture about his work, which includes elements from LARPs (Live Action Roleplaying, like we talked about with &quot;First Person&quot;). Although this presentation was astoundingly boring, he did talk about how LARPs are evolving beyond the fantasy/sci-fi genre. He briefly touched on Colonial Williamsburg, which intrigued me because it seemed like a very problematic premise, like living out a colonial fantasy. I went to their website to find out more, and it turns out it&#039;s a lot more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
