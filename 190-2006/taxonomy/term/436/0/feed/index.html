 <title>Speaking of Re-mixing</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/404</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t pretend to be hipster enough to know really anything about this, but isn&#039;t the type of remix that in the New Media article DJ Tim Simenon is talking about now called a mash-up?  Is that what we&#039;re calling it these days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, from what I&#039;ve heard, mash-ups are kind of amazing and kind of rock my world.  They aren&#039;t much different from what Manovich is describing except instead of manipulating a single track with an anonymous extra beat or mixing around one artists&#039; track and turning it into a more upbeat or slower version, mash-ups instead mix two tracks by usually very very different artists in ways that present the best of both tracks.  The first one I heard was on the radio this summer and it was Gnarls Barkley and the Raconteurs, a mash-up of &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Steady as she Goes&quot; and named, appropriately, &quot;Crazy as she Goes&quot;.  So I heard this and thought, you know, that this was just a crazy and kind of cool endeavor one DJ embarked upon until I discovered Girl Talk.  Girl Talk is a little bit different because he [yeah, it&#039;s just this one dude, crazy right], as Pitchfork so succintly put it, &quot;crams six or eight or 14 or 20 songs into frenetic rows, slicing fragments off 1980s pop, Dirty South rap, booty bass, and grunge, among countless other genres. Then he pieces together the voracious music fan&#039;s dream: a hulking hyper-mix designed to make you dance, wear out predictable ideas, and defy hopeless record-reviewing&quot;.  Sooo it&#039;s a few more than two songs, but it&#039;s still equally incredible.  If you want to see a video of this man in action (who will also be in action next semester in Dom&#039;s Social Room!!!), check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/2006/9/11/Video_Girl_Talk_Empty_Bottle_090906#38460&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
