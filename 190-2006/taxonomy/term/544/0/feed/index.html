 <title>my favorite website</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/475</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody! I&#039;m going to tell you about one of my favorite websites! This is i-am-asian.com. Guess what? It&#039;s a website for McDonalds! That&#039;s right, they trademarked asserting one&#039;s asian identity as a marketing strategy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out about this site a few years ago, when I went to the Tet (Lunar New year for Viet folks like me) festival in Little Saigon, which McDonalds helped sponsor. I was given a goodie bag that had the website on it. Inside, I got a flyer telling me about how Mulan 2 was coming out soon on DVD. Anyways, i was blown away by the website. When I first logged on, automatically playing in the background was the jingle &quot;ba ba ba ba I&#039;m lovin&#039; it&quot;, accompanied by a slide show with different images of asian-americans, including a photo of a dog wearing an I-Am-Asian.com t-shirt. There was a welcoming paragraph that said something to the extent of how Asian-Americans juggle two cultures and are proud of both, and how you&#039;re just as likely to celebrate the customs of your country as going out for a big mac (i&#039;m not kidding). the website also had a section about different asian countries, their cultures, holidays, etc. There was also a section about different asian-americans who had prominent jobs in the mcdonalds corporation. Now I feel empowered!!&lt;/p&gt;
