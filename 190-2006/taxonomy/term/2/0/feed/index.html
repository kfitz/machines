 <title>Contrasting Views: Barthes-v-Feminism</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/71</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to express my thoughts on the link between this week&#039;s two articles. I think it is apparent that they are both about exploring the significance of underrepresented voices, be they from women, racial minorities, etc. What stands out to me is how different their conclusions are about suggestions for the future of authorship, as compared to last week&#039;s readings. Marchessault frankly states, &quot;Unlike Barthes&#039; Great Authors (MallarmÃ©, Proust, Balzac), women have nothing to gain from the destruction of the author at this historical juncture&quot; (89). Women have been working for literary recognition for so long, and just as they are approaching this prize, Barthes is calling for its obliteration.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Don&#039;t you just love...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/39</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;...when your courses overlap?  Today in my 19th Century U.S. Women Writers course we spent a chunk of time discussing the &quot;role of the author&quot; in a text.  This was actually kind of shocking because, I&#039;ll admit, I found myself questioning the importance of last week&#039;s discussion (is that bad?).  The class consensus seemed to be that the author could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be separated from the text, but likewise that the reader should not rely solely on the author&#039;s background/purpose to understand a text- one of those happy, indecisive &quot;middle-ground&quot; things.  Nothing new here, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation became more interesting when we accepted that the author and the text were, to a degree, inseparable, and focused on the implications of this connection, such as the effect the gender of the author has on a text.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>the bloody mess we call &quot;authorship&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/32</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I agree completely with msblogger, who says, &quot;I do believe it is important to acknowledge that there is never a single author of a work (society, surroundings, family, etc. all influence an author).&quot;  If Barthes is saying that an author pens nothing that has not been taught to him by his external surroundings, I could not agree more.  Still, his thesis can&#039;t accurately be labeled &quot;the death of the author,&quot; since it seems the author never really existed with this train of thought.  Also, if no person exists outside her influences, why distinguish between the author and the scriptor (if we are equal to the sum our influences, and so is our writing)?  I don&#039;t see why Barthes should mix his philosophy and the everyday functionality of conventions, acting as if we should rebel against the ever-evil &quot;Author&#039;s empire&quot;: &quot;The author still reigns in manuals of literary history, in biographies of writers, magazine interviews, and in the very consciousness of litterateurs eager to unite--their person and their work; the image of literature to be found in contemporary culture is tyrannically centered on the author--&quot; (50).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The true death of an author is censorship</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/31</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;...the birth of the reader must be requited by the death of the Author&quot; (Barthes 55). I believe that Barthes is being way too naive here with this statement. The truth death of an author figuratively speaking is when they are censored and literally speaking when they are put to death for what they write. When an author is censored, they die for their authorship which exists and is created for the sake of their readership in the hopes and dreams that what the author writes can plant seeds of new ideas and truths for the readership. It is a delicate and a beautiful relationship that has endured history and which has allowed for the creation of countless books.  To say that &quot;the birth of the reader must be requited by the death of the Author&quot; is denying the menacingly reality of censorship and punishment by governing bodies who will do what it takes to control what the reader reads.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scattered thoughts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/29</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I would have to agree with others that Barthes&#039; essay was a little extreme for me. The essay was not the most coherent reading I have ever done and the messages were thoughtful, but a little too intense.  While I do agree that text should be interpreted through the eyes of the reader and deconstructed for what it actually is, I do not think the author needs to be completely dismissed.  Learning about an author after interpreting one of their texts can introduce a new criticism or shed new light upon the text that the reader would not have seen without that knowledge. I do believe it is important to acknowledge that there is never a single author of a work (society, surroundings, family, etc. all influence an author).  Foucault talks about how literary works are a result of cultural settings, not a single individual.  While I agree with the idea that society influences all authors and their ideas are not necessarily unique because they are constantly receiving ideas from their surroundings, I think it is important to consider the writer&#039;s background to take into account any spin they may have placed in the writing. So while I agree that literary works are not the result of one individual, but the result of a cultural experience, it is important to realize that one person did take the time to put their experience or opinions into a work and although they are influenced by the world they live in, they are still the person who expressed this experience.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Oh, Barthes--</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/28</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found Barthes&#039; essay rather extreme.  Perhaps this is because I&#039;m very attached to the concept of &quot;The Author.&quot;  I usually tell people &quot;I like Sylvia Plath,&quot; before &quot;I like The Bell Jar.&quot;  I believe this is primarily influenced by my opinion of an author as a whole, rather than just the work produced.  When I find an author whose work I truly enjoy, I try to learn more about who she/he is and how she/he lives, not only to give me a new understanding of the text, but to give me a new appreciation for the work.  Would I enjoy The Bell Jar as much if I didn&#039;t have a sense of who the author was?  (Okay, okay, maybe this is an extreme example--)  Of course, I can&#039;t answer this question, because almost every text I have encountered is supplemented with information about the author/s.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Murdering the Author</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Barthes has an way of writing which makes me feel as if he wants to be so far separated from his &quot;authorship&quot; of this essay we have read. The death of the author through the reader is an idea, that in many ways makes sense. For example, tonight when we sit around and discuss the essay, by doing that without taking into account the various intericacies of Barthes and what lead him to write this essay, we essentially dismiss his presence and take the work for our own. Now this is not to say we hold any ownership of the piece, as we are just the critics, however, our individual interpretations of the work leads us to become a form of meta-author in our own right, asserting our own experiences as Foucault states, into the work we are both accessing and creating.&lt;/p&gt;
