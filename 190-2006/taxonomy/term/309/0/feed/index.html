 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I read about Murray&#039;s description of the intersections of new media and the communities that are being fostered through them, half of the time I&#039;m frightened, and from first-hand experience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Mom got re-married this summer and, like all brides-to-be, it was pretty much all she could talk about.  Apparently, myself, my [now] stepdad and other friends and family weren&#039;t enough people to talk to, as she became really involved in a number of online wedding forums and posting boards as well.  For my stepdad and I, marriage gossip from these boards was actually in some ways welcome respite from my Mom&#039;s previous and equally vocal obsession with internet-based geneaology-- that&#039;s what we thought, anyway, until we realized that hearing about the wedding gown of &quot;chrisandtara06&quot; was not a whole lot more interesting than finding out &quot;omgi&#039;mrelatedtocharlemagne&quot; was my great-great-great-step-twice-removed-uncle.  Nevertheless, my Mom was obsessed; I can even remember at least 3 times this summer that she mentioned, in passing, that she was up past 3 in the morning talking to other brides-to-be from around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
