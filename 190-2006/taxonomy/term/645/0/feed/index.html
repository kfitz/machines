 <title>Dominos pizza</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard that their has been controversy over the Brooklyn Style Pizza commercial by Dominos.  People from Brooklyn find the stereotypes of heavily accented Brooklyners to be offensive and over the top.  I heard that the mayor spoke out against the commercial, but couldn&#039;t actually find anything on this over the net.  Here is the link to the commercial:&lt;br /&gt;

On Dominos website they talk about the pizza advertising campaign by saying, &quot;We found that Brooklyners like to eat their pizza differently. They like floppy, large slices, and they fold them into almost a sandwich. Brooklyn has such a big personality.  It&#039;s a little different than the Manhattan-style personality. We&#039;re really having a lot of fun with the culture.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
