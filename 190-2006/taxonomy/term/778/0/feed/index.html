 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hilarious, really. There&#039;s been some interesting stuff in the news lately about Japanese girls going &quot;bihaku,&quot; which means &quot;whity beauty.&quot; A few years ago, everyone was &quot;ganguro,&quot; which means &quot;black-faced,&quot; or &quot;skin cancer.&quot; Tanning beds were all the rage for a bit, but now everyone&#039;s putting crap (powdered swallow droppings, for instance) on themselves to get pale. I remembered reading something earlier this year about tyrosinase researchers in Hiroshima making a breakthrough of some sort (http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/news/ng.asp?n=65637-melanins-skin-whitening), but I guess it didn&#039;t occur to me that they were making such a vital contribution to what appear to be a booming sector of the cosmetics industry. &quot;That&#039;s funny,&quot; I said to myself, and did more research.&lt;/p&gt;
