 <title>Stuff from another class</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought y&#039;all would find this interesting. Ghostwriter are both taking (were both taking :) ) Sociology of Popular Music and our final project was probably more applicable to this particular Senior Seminar class, since we tackled the issue of authorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with a Pitzer student who&#039;s a singer, the three of us decided to perform three different versions of the same song - Jose Gonzalez&#039;s &quot;Crosses&quot;. I don&#039;t know if you all are familiar with the song, but it&#039;s a pretty good slow acoustic number. Really folky. So Ghostwriter did a slow, keyboard-based soulful ballad. I did an uptempo, punk-ish version on my acoustic guitar, and the Pitzer student, who is Latin-American, sang it poppier and included a verse in Spanish. We were looking at how the song&#039;s meanings and style were altered in the mind of the audience when singers with different ethnic backgrounds sang it in a style more closely associated with their ethnicity. It was a great song to choose for that project also because Gonzalez is Swedish, born of Argentinian parents, playing a style that isn&#039;t really associated with either of those countries - at least in &quot;Crosses&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
