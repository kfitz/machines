 <title>Music Copyrights</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/587</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Just an interesting article I thought I should share after our discussion last week.  We discussed copyright laws of books, but apparently a lot of music artists would like to extend the time frame on music copyrights.  Since there is such a large industry in re-releasing old hits or remaking old hits, copyright laws are clearly important for the music industry. The article connects the recent use of downloading as a source of consumption of music to copyright laws, somewhat unclearly. Anyway, it&#039;s interesting and you should all check it out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this quote most interesting and relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Should we ditch Jar Jar Binks?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/562</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I definitely would have concerns for what would happen to artists if copyright laws were completely abandoned, I&#039;m not entirely convinced that they do more good than they do harm. Whether they last for 75 years after the artist&#039;s death, or just 75 minutes, what is the point in prohibiting others from taking your work and making it (possibly) better? Yes, I know that sentence sounds strange. But seriously, if &quot;Star Wars&quot; is made better by excluding Jar Jar Binks, and consequently the maker of the Star Wars/The Phantom Edit profits from his improvement on the film, maybe by allowing this sort of freedom we will actually be encouraging artists to make their work even better the first time around to prevent people from taking it, tweaking it, and selling it later.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>We Are Felons--Is an Honor Code the Cure?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/468</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In Free Culture, Lawrence Lessig says that the RIAA reported 43 million Americans downloaded music illegally in May 2002 (199). In other words, 43 million Americans (or 20%) are felons. I think it&#039;s safe to say that many college students now were/are in that mix. Lessig&#039;s point? A law is more ineffective the more people violate it. When 20% of a country violate a law, that law should be considered seriously and potentially changed. He says this, and I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of the 11th Commandment? &quot;Thou shall not get caught.&quot; It&#039;s very American. Basically, anything goes as long as nobody finds out. Bill Clinton, Nixon, Carl Rove--politicians know that commandment well. That&#039;s the kind of dishonest ideology increasingly developing among Americans in recent years, and that is what Lessig means when he says, &quot;Overregulation corrupts citizens&quot; (199).&lt;/p&gt;
