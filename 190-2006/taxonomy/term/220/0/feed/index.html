 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m not sure if this is something everyone already knows about, but YouTube and MySpace are in trouble with copyright laws.  They rank 2nd and 3rd for the most videos shown per day (next to Yahoo (?)), and many of the videos posted by users who don&#039;t have the rights to do so.  YouTube is throwing cash to Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group in order to avoid a lawsuit, and MySpace has some deal with Snocap I&#039;m sure could be better described by our class MySpace expert (sorry I&#039;m bad with names, no sarcasm intended).  As we&#039;ve seen with the South Park videos, YouTube is working on technology to keep users from posting copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Celebrities using MySpace</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/538</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicole Richie posted this on her MySpace blog yesterday. Its no longer up though. :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: X-RAY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BLIND ITEM:&lt;br /&gt;
What 35 year old raisin face whispers her order of 3 peices of asparagus for dinner at Chateau everynight, and hides her deathly disorder by pointing the finger at me, and used her last paycheck I wrote her to pay for a publisist instead of a nutritionist?&lt;br /&gt;
HINT: Her nickname is lettucecup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;source: http://www.myspace.com/nicolerichie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*********************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;
As we all know, the whole celebutante craze is based on these girls who are basically famous for doing nothing particular at all. Of course, nothing other than creating drama and partying. Essentially.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>I&#039;m just going to start typing</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/522</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m not really sure what point I&#039;m going to make with this, but I feel that there is one, so I&#039;m just going to type pretty much as fast as I can and see what comes out (other than typos). And if any of you can think of a good point to add to this, then please be my guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Anyway, I was up in Petaluma, north of San Francisco over the Thanksgiving break, spending some time with my aunt. She&#039;s a screenwriter/story consultant, who just got out of a couple-year-long gig with a public access television station up there. She&#039;s trying to start up projects and whatnot and has decided that mySpace is the way to do it. Her being of my parents&#039; generation, she is not as familiar with recent technological advances, and enlisted me as her mySpace tutor for an afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Lawsuit</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/491</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found another interesting news story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6160414.stm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s about Universal Music Group suing MySpace for encouraging copyright infringement. Wtf? Why would they waste their time with this? It seems to me like MySpace&#039;s case is pretty airtight, as they&#039;ve done less to encourage law-breaking than almost any musically-oriented site since prior to Napster&#039;s inception. In fact, MySpace is nothing but good for music - the industry, the musicians, the art form. This is a terrible PR move and an unwinnable case. Seriously, if anyone can see why a record company would continue the litigation against this particular site, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Thoughts on &quot;Models of Pride&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/382</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I (somehow) dragged myself out of bed at 7:30am to go to &quot;Models of Pride,&quot; which is an annual LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) youth conference held at Occidental College. A lot of the workshops were media-related, so I thought I&#039;d just blog about my experience at the conference and some of the things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part One, or omg I&#039;m old:&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, the description of the event says it&#039;s a youth conference geared towards queer youth between the ages of 14 and 23. However, when I got there, I definitely felt that it was geared more towards high school students. When we were in small groups for an &quot;icebreaker,&quot; my group of 12 had about 3 people over 18. But everyone was really nice. But I still felt really old basically the whole time I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Tila Tequila</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/205</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was reading Rolling Stone instead of doing my homework and I came across an article that I thought might be interesting slash relevant to the class so I am posting about it in hopes that I will absolve the guilt I feel for not doing what I should be doing.  Anyhow, I was reading about a girl who goes by the name of Tila Tequila who has recently been anointed the &quot;first star of MySpace.&quot; At last count she had of 1.4 million friends and a total of 45 million views making her the most popular person on MySpace. For these oh-so fine accomplishments she has earned herself an interview on MSNBC, graced the cover of Stuff magazine, launched a clothing line, been offered a book proposal and she is now a rising hip-hop star with several of her songs topping the unsigned acts charts on MySpace.  This 25 year old Vietnamese-American girl claims to be &quot;one of the realest girls out there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
