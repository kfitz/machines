 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know what happened in between that rebellious young sprite and this washed up college student struggling to finish six blogs before I leave this desk.  I was going somewhere with this, but I forget where.  So in lieu of that I think this would be a good time and place to do a quarter-life assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit in front of three parking tickets, from various times in the past few weeks when I&#039;ve lost or otherwise neglected my car.  I found my bike last night while skateboarding because I thought my bike had been stolen.  I left it on the bike rack outside our class last wednesday.  In fifth grade I thought I had been shot but really a kid had just thrown an egg at my head.  I did accidentally stick a tack in my temple last year however.  I also thought kiddie porn was &quot;kitty porn&quot; until last year.  A documentary I was making for an independent study is due tomorrow but both Pitzer&#039;s and my harddrive are out of space so I&#039;m not sure what to do.  Mario, I copped your suicide idea for my final media sketchbook film.  Lindsay, the music you asked about from our prank-remake video is DJ Schmolli &quot;satan.omen.death,&quot; chosen by Mario.  And Clay, I feel like I&#039;m leaving you out of this list of people who won&#039;t read this, did you know Lawless brought your Bush bombing video up at the trial?  I can&#039;t remember why, but oh, did she bring it up.  And I&#039;m forgetting Professor Fitzpatrick: I&#039;m sorry I haven&#039;t responded to your email, as you can see I&#039;ve been busy blogging but I will get to it asap.&lt;/p&gt;
