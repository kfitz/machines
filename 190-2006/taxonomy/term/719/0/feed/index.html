 <title>Picture me in class when you read this. It will be almost like I was there.</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I wasn&#039;t able to come to class tonight due to a prior engagement so I am blogging to convey my sadness for not being able to attend class and hear about everyone&#039;s wonderful papers and projects. I am sure they were all extraordinarily fascinating as I would expect nothing less from such an academically gifted group of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, since I have yet to blog about my term paper slash thesis and I was unable to talk about it with you all in class today I am going to briefly blog about it instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes... I have chosen to write my thesis about the ways in which the US media portray Latinos and how these representations fuel the perceptions of Latinos in American society and more specifically how these media images impact public opinion on immigration and border policy. Phew. That&#039;s a mouth full.&lt;/p&gt;
