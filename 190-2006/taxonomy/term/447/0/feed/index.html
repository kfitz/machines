 <title>authoring a religion</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/412</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, so someone blogged about last week&#039;s episode of South Park and Cartman&#039;s anticipation of the new Nintendo Wii being released.  Well, South Park is amazing and I wanted to put something out there that was in that episode that everyone should know about. Some of you have probably heard about this already, but for those of you who haven&#039;t... it&#039;s pretty interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
So in the episode, Mrs. Garrison is instructed to teach the class about evolution and has an issue teaching it to her students. Basically, there is a reference to believing in a Flying Spaghetti Monster as god.  This is not just a random South Park comment.  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists and it is actually quite popular.  Followers of the religion are called Pastafarians. A man named Bobby Henderson had an issue with a Kansas school district teaching the theory of Intelligent Design as well as evolution and wrote a letter to the school board about teaching all the various theories of Intelligent Design if they were going to teach any. He goes on to explain his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and how it should be taught in school. He explains that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth and placed all the evidence of evolution here. It was actually very detailed and included everything from diagrams to a graph explaining that the reason we have global warming is the due to the decrease in the number of pirates in the world since the 1800&#039;s.  Anyway, you can read the open letter at this site:&lt;/p&gt;
