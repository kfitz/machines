 <title>That&#039;s child&#039;s play</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/570</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to that lunch with one of the new potential profs yesterday and she got me thinking about a topic I don&#039;t feel we talk about much as media studies majors -- children and the media. She compared regular schools with Montessori and Waldorf schools (which severely limit if not totally eliminate) media in the classroom and said she much prefers the regular schools&#039; system of media exposure. (Apparently, Waldorf schools even go so far as to prohibit the families of the children from owning a television!) The professor was definitely very against these policies. She said she would never send her child to a school like that because they go so against what she believes in. She felt that so much of children&#039;s play stems from things children have seen on TV shows and in other media that it would be wrong to prohibit children from having access to movies, television, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
