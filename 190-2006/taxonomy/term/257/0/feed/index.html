 <description>&lt;p&gt;While visiting my usual online haunts I found a blog to blog about!  Virginia Heffernan&#039;s &quot;Screens&quot; blog discovered a new use of YouTube!  And to think we had exhausted YouTube&#039;s potential--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heffernan reports on a YouTuber who found a way to make money: homemade advertisements for big corporations!  The goal was to finance two months rent in San Francisco by scamming The Man.  The unnamed YouTuber picked up a vintage Nike t-shirt, gave it to a friend to wear at a David Rodigan concert (D.J. RamJam), and film the whole thing.  Next, he sent a letter to Nike explaining the project, and when the video received 15,000 hits, the user received a check for $1,815.88 from Nike.  As Heffernan points out, the video didn&#039;t attract viewers because it was an advertisement for Nike (at least not initially), it attracted viewers because of the DJ.  After watching the video, it&#039;s pretty hard to miss the glaring Nike symbol in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Are blogs doomed?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/245</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I was going to write about how Google is taking overe the world.  A few weeks ago I had a discussion with some people in my hall about Google being Jesus, because the internet was &quot;broken,&quot; except for Google!  In any case, I got a bit caught up with Google buying YouTube but never got around to posting about it.  People have posted YouTube links on here before, but I&#039;m not sure that anyone discussed Google buying YouTube (at quite a hefty sum...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, just as I was going to post about it, I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://screens.blogs.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which is slightly more relevant to our class.  So, thoughts anyone?  Are blogs doomed because they&#039;re bound to language?  Are blogs-in-translation out of the question?  And to what extend is a blog-in-translation the same as the original?  While this video doesn&#039;t rely on language, it does rely on Western pop-culture references, so can it really be universal?  Interesting to note that this commentary was posted in a NY Times blog...&lt;/p&gt;
