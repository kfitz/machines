 <title>DORITOS</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/591</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;And as I was closing YouTube, I ran across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=CrashtheSuperBowl&quot;&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to win $10,000 please.  Anyhow, I know we all blog YouTube into the ground as though it were a dead monkey and we were all stomping on it and the terrain was slightly soft, but I thought this should be brought up due to the 1) obvious monetary reward we all have to gain from it and 2) how interesting it is that companies are looking online for commercial talent.  I know this isn&#039;t the first time this has been done; in fact there have been a lot of online commercial video contests in the last few years, but I still found it interesting.  I can&#039;t decide if this is good or bad.  I feel like it&#039;s a good thing--another step for the American Dream, where anyone with a camera and editing program can succeed if they are talented enough--but also bad, because The Man is raping our precious anarchist internet of its DaVincis and Einsteins.&lt;/p&gt;
