 <title>Why do I Phrase All my Titles as Questions?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/53</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Both authors brought up the issue of language as a stumbling block in the participation of non-mainstream groups in the mainstream of intelligentsia. As someone who&#039;s grown up surrounded by academics (I&#039;d say a good 1/3 of my family, extended and otherwise, are professors), this is not something that I ever realized was a problem, as academic-speak comes almost more naturally to me than that Spanish I took for four or five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who would probably be considered a member of both oppressed groups that we are considering this week (as a woman, and as a &quot;racial minority&quot;), I have to wonder what the solution to the problem of the dominant academic language being sourced from a different &quot;culture&quot; would look like. As Bell Hooks discusses it, it makes perfect sense--black youth choose not (or perhaps cannot) to participate as heavily in what might be considered &quot;high culture&quot; or &quot;academic&quot; cultural pursuits simply because these activities, as we perceive them in the wider Western culture, simply have no bearing on their cultural experience... they are not framed in a &quot;language&quot; or set of conceptual building blocks which they can consider their own, and therefore a language they feel they cannot adequately express themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
