 <title>achoo! (i just sneezed and can&#039;t think of a title)</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;other people have touched upon this in Vaidhyanathan&#039;s work, but one of the things he talks about that i find really interesting is how people are taking films and creating their own edits and interpretations, like the Phantom Edit, or Puchkov&#039;s goblin dubs. What I liked about this was the idea that usually when people think about art, but particularly with film since production is such a process, what people view is often seen as a finished product. With what these folks are doing, they&#039;re asserting that art is never finished, and can always be reinterpreted, retinkered with, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theme we&#039;ve talked about in class while discussing authorship, is one does the role of intention play. Does it matter what the author intends at all? As Vaidhyanathan writes, &quot;an author cannot control how a character, idea or plot will be read, refasioned, or criticized&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
