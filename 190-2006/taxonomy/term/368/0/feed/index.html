 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Music of the Republic of Vietnam - Before and After the Diaspora&lt;br /&gt;
- Lecture by Jason Gibbs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, November 2 at 4:15 - 5:30 p.m. (followed by reception)&lt;br /&gt;
Hahn 108 (420 Harvard Ave.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the end of World War II, civil conflict has divided Vietnamese society and, for a period, Vietnam itself. During the Cold War, an actual boundary at the 17th parallel blocked contact between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the North and the American-supported Republic of Vietnam in the South. While the communist North used centralized control to insure that its music served the interests of socialism and total mobilization for war, the South developed an eclectic, market driven popular music culture. Following the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, the victorious communists banned and worked to confiscate nearly all cultural products of the South. The music of the Republic of Vietnam, however, has survived and developed among the waves of refugees and immigrants from Vietnam to the U.S. and other countries in the West. Despite government suppression, it has also continuously thrived in Vietnam&#039;s black markets. Over the past decade the cultural division between Vietnam and diasporic Vietnamese moderated considerably with singers and songwriters from both sides regularly performing both in Vietnam and the West. This talk will discuss the music of the Republic of Vietnam and consider its genesis and continued popularity in Vietnam and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
