 <title>Since when is Alanis Morissette an actress?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/543</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What?! - Alanis Morrisette was on Nip/Tuck tonight. I had no idea she was trying to act. Sorry about the misleading title, though, I have nothing more to say about her and her acting career...&lt;br /&gt;
Except that I&#039;m pretty sure she was doing a better job that the people on the &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; episode of Law &amp;amp; Order: Criminal Intent. THis is the one that was mentioned earlier in the blog, and I couldn&#039;t resist tuning in to see television sample internet culture. The law &amp;amp; order shows seem to pride themselves on creating timely storylines - actually they just rip stuff out of headlines, add a nicely packaged ending, and spice it with a little extra drama and fake blood. This time though, they&#039;re sampling directly, and I mean very directly, from YouTube. The girl cast looked like LonelyGirl, pranced around her room like her, and had an almost exact replica of her &quot;set&quot; in the YouTube vlogs. But this time, they raised the stakes and people died because of an internet hoax and acting experiment. And then, tah dah, the girl becomes famous and gets a deal, just like the real Jessica Rose. It&#039;s like the dark side of YouTube - a hoax gone bad, psychotic actors, blanks that kill - evidently it&#039;s not all fun and games. this is what happens when you use the medium in a way not prescribed - people die. So stick to convention.&lt;/p&gt;
