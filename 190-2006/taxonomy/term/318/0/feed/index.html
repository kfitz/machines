 <title>PRT: pt. 4: identity networks!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/292</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Another topic I was thinking about doing was exploring networks that target specific identities. for example, in the last few years there has been the creation of a couple Asian-American TV networks, such as AZN TV and Imaginasian TV, and queer channels, such as LOGO, Here TV, and the now defunct QTV. There have been such channels for awhile, such as BET, Lifetime, Oxygen and Spike TV. However, what interested me about the Asian and the Queer ones (Besides the fact that those are both part of my identities and the channels suck less than Oxygen and Lifetime), is that they are new, so they are in the process of creating what asian-american identity is or what queer identity is in television. this is particularly true with asian-americans, since there is virtually no asian-american programming outside these networks. What statements do these channels say with their programming? Do they cater to a wide audience within their respective targets or do they offer a limited view? At home, I have access to AZN TV. It&#039;s programming is interesting. It has some specifically Asian-American programming, like one that looks at upcoming films, another that looks at asian-american comedians, and another that will document a few students while their applying to ivy league colleges. mixed in with asian-american programming, is straight up asian programming from asia, like those korean dramas i&#039;ve been talking about. in this construction of asian-america, while the channel acknowledges that there is a unique asian-american identity, they create a link with both america and asia by featuring asian programming. asian-american encompasses many different people, it can apply to those who have just immigrated (if they choose to identify as such) or those born here after generations of parents living here. does AZN TV unite these people? in my own experience, my mom would watch the channel alot for her korean soap operas, which is pretty devoid from dealing with the issues of racism that asian-americans have to deal with. however, during the channel promos that would be shown during commercials, various hosts from other shows would talk about their experiences with being asian-american...so my lil asian mommy who doesn&#039;t directly discuss the issues of race and asian-americana becomes exposed to those issues, and i the american can become exposed to asian cultural exports. however, AZN TV is still pretty heterocentric (though there was one segment in the film show once that talked about the queer film &quot;Saving Face&quot; but other than that it&#039;s heterocity). also, almost all the asian-american hosts of shows are east asian, only one is south asian, only one is mixed. AZN TV only represents a very specific segment of Asian-America.&lt;/p&gt;
