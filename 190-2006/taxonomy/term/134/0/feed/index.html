 <title>Further discussion of the Drink Cocaine campaign</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/139</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this by saying that I think that our country&#039;s stance on the matter of illegal substances is terribly misguided, I think that DARE does a lot more damage than good, and that the FDA and DEA are clearly more interested in regulating private citizen&#039;s personal morality on the basis of a highly conservative, fundamentalist Christian-oriented, and over-all misinformed perception of the dissemination, use, and effects of most so-called &quot;narcotics&quot; and controlled substances than in the protection of the citizenry. The FDA is a powerhouse of hegemonic regulation of &quot;controlled substances&quot;, not only does it directly control what substances can and can not be legally sold and how and in what quantities, etc. but it also controls what sort of research can be done on controlled substances. You can&#039;t research their effects without obtaining the substance and you can not legally and ethically obtain it for a viable research experiment without going through the FDA, which categorically refuses to give clearance or supplies to any proposed research with the intent or potential to disprove the governmental and departmental stance on controlled substances. They not only control the substances but the knowledge that can be generated in regards to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*pant pant* My desultory diatribe on drug regulation in this country now out of the way, on to the matter of Cocaine: Energy Drink....&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Response to &quot;Where&#039;s the line?&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/135</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What a bizarre idea. On the one hand, the company is appropriating the name of a very hard core drug to capitalize on what it represents -- it is illicit, hardcore, rebellious and taboo to be a cocaine user. On the other hand, however, the drink claims to be more pure than most energy drinks and all of the charities the company supports are ones that deal with drug and alcohol addiction. If they are really so concerned with helping these causes, wouldn&#039;t it seem more productive to resist tapping into the &quot;cool factor&quot; of hardcore drugs strictly for the company&#039;s own monetary purposes?&lt;/p&gt;
