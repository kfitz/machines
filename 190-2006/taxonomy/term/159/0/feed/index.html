 <title>The internet made you go broke</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;More about the internet and personal identity...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much can the internet affect you?&lt;br /&gt;
Consider this, what if in a few years you are applying for a job and your future employer goes online and conducts a search foryou and finds incriminating information, or worse, pictures of you. And then you do not get the job. And what if you never even knew that such things were online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoy the internet and the way it facilitates many everyday things, I&#039;, definitely aware of the potential danger it can pose to you and the way you are presented to the public. Living in a time when most people have the internet and have the ability to post things about you on a whim... how do you protect yourself? How exactly do you take control of your identity and prevent someone else from controlling you. For now, I suggest you be careful about who takes pictures of you in certain situation, because once its online, always on.&lt;/p&gt;
