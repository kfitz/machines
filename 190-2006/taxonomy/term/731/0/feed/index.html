 <title>Guttlesohn Falls, Wisconsin</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaking of perusing Facebook, I don&#039;t know if any of you have come across this before, but there is an entire fake community created by Harvey Mudd kids of people from Guttlesohn Falls, Wisconsin. It&#039;s difficult to describe, but all the pictures are like old daguerrotypes from the 1800s and they&#039;ve got ridiculous names like Thatcher Worthington Guttlesohn. They&#039;ve created groups like the Guttlesohn Falls Rotary and the Guttlesohn Falls Hunting Club. It&#039;s an entire false reality that they&#039;ve been able to realize through the virtual social networking tool that is Facebook. I definitely recommend that everyone go check this out, because they have been so diligent and thorough about it. I&#039;ve thought about joining their community, since there are dozens of them, but for some reason it feels really wrong to try that. It seems like a well-defined space, but I know that anytime I want to I could join it and no one would know/be able to stop me. It&#039;s a really cool idea, and if any of you are involved, mad props to you.&lt;/p&gt;
