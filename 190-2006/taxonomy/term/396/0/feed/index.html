 <title>authoring a religion</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/412</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, so someone blogged about last week&#039;s episode of South Park and Cartman&#039;s anticipation of the new Nintendo Wii being released.  Well, South Park is amazing and I wanted to put something out there that was in that episode that everyone should know about. Some of you have probably heard about this already, but for those of you who haven&#039;t... it&#039;s pretty interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
So in the episode, Mrs. Garrison is instructed to teach the class about evolution and has an issue teaching it to her students. Basically, there is a reference to believing in a Flying Spaghetti Monster as god.  This is not just a random South Park comment.  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists and it is actually quite popular.  Followers of the religion are called Pastafarians. A man named Bobby Henderson had an issue with a Kansas school district teaching the theory of Intelligent Design as well as evolution and wrote a letter to the school board about teaching all the various theories of Intelligent Design if they were going to teach any. He goes on to explain his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and how it should be taught in school. He explains that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth and placed all the evidence of evolution here. It was actually very detailed and included everything from diagrams to a graph explaining that the reason we have global warming is the due to the decrease in the number of pirates in the world since the 1800&#039;s.  Anyway, you can read the open letter at this site:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Clearly, I&#039;m obsessed with Post Secret</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/354</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after that (quite overly-long) entry on Post Secret, I&#039;ve realized my mind is very much still churning. I&#039;ve now got on to thinking about authorship and Post Secret. In looking at authorship in relationship to Post Secret we are not only confronted by the interplay between authorship and intention but also by the fact that what we see in the Post Secret website and in the books has been touched by someone other than the secret-holders. Frank Warren is allowed to edit the submissions and print and post some submissions while leaving out others. On the books, he is listed as the sole author. (Of course, what other author could he possibly list since the whole point is that the postcards are sent anonymously???). Still, it is these anonymous authors&#039; words that I read in the books and on the website and I feel they are so much more the authors of Post Secret than Frank Warren. Really though, the only way I can justify to myself that he is credited as the author is by appointing him as the author of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
