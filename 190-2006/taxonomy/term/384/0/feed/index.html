 <description>&lt;p&gt;When reading First Person, I immediately noticed the layout. For a book addressing issues of new media, merging forms of storytelling, it felt that the layout was designed to somewhat reflect that. At the tops of each page, is the name of the section and the name of the authors and reponders, positioned in a way where the text looks like links. There were other ways where the layout reminded me of a web page. Unlike other books, where the responses to an article would be merely posted after the article, here they are posted simultaneously with the article, on the bottom third of the page. This is interesting because while I was reading the article, I was visually reminded that there were multiple point of views to this topic, instead of being completely immersed in the text at hand as the end all be all. In a way, the reader is presented with the multitude of possibilities, that Murray is so fond of, in the reading experience. Also, since the responses didn&#039;t come directly at the end, after I read the article, I would have to turn back the pages and start over. This reminded me of being on a poorly designed page, where I would have to always press the back button after reading something to get back to the menu. In this way, the reading of the book isn&#039;t exactly a linear process. In addition to this, the articles are divided in columns, which is reminiscent of a newsletter or a newspaper, so it&#039;s like a combination of thesis different mediums born of different eras.&lt;/p&gt;
