 <title>Advertising as a Career</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/324</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday and Saturday I went to Advertising Career Days held in Los Angeles--in the Convention Center and at various ad agencies. I&#039;m not sure where everyone else is at, in terms of figuring out your careers, but I am clueless. I decided to check this out, and I was really impressed. We were taken on tours of two companies the first day. (I had DDB and Muse, if that means anything to anyone. They both do Wells Fargo. Also, DDB did the Emmy-winning Ameriquest Superbowl commercial where it looks like a guy is killing a cat when his date walks in. Anyways...) Then we had time for networking in a room where many, many agencies had booths with brochures set up.&lt;/p&gt;
