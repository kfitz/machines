 <title>Where is the bell hooks?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/48</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I should have asked this before, but it&#039;s been a really busy week and I *thought* I had the right readings. Like atleast one other person, I printed out the Marchessault and the Manovich becuause they were the only readings posted that we hadn&#039;t already done. It occured to me belatedly that &quot;Forms&quot; seemed a little out of place. So I consulted the syllabus and upon discovering that we were supposed to have read bell hooks I started looking frantically for it. But I can&#039;t find it. Am I an idiot? Am I completely overlooking something painfully obvious? If anyone can help me, PLEASE DO!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>question</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/46</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Why is it that the dead author is a woman if the argument relies on the fact that women have been marginalized and oppressed?  Shouldn&#039;t the dead author then be argued to be anyone other than the white, male author? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean Just as it was hard for women to get recognition as credible writters, I think that other minority groups faced difficulties as well.  Why are they still alive?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Why do the sites where we get our online readings change every semester?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/37</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess this has to do with Media Studies, since it deals with the posting and sharing of information online.  I&#039;m just wondering why the sites where we get our online readings for class change every semester.  First everyone used eRes and WebCT... then last year it was Moodle... and now it&#039;s Sakai.  Why hasn&#039;t Pomona just made one site for online readings and stuck with it?  I guess the advantage of Sakai over Moodle is that students from all the Claremont Colleges can access it... but Moodle could have just been updated to allow for this.  If anyone knows about the reasoning behind the switc&lt;/p&gt;
