 <title>thesis woes</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/520</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is just an emotional, crazy rant. This whole thesis process has, on one hand, been an intriguing process trying to find out what in the realm of media really interests me. However, not knowing what the topic I care about the most has made this entire semester, in terms of this project and thinking about thesis, like pulling teeth. Being overwhelmed by different things this semester, I decided to do my paper on something that I am interested in, though not necessarily for my thesis, just because I needed to start doing work on it. I&#039;m writing on Wikipedia.  Now I have 20 pages ahead of me to write, and i cannot make myself do it. I have no idea what I am doing. Is it because I&#039;m disorganized, or is it because I&#039;m not feeling the topic? But, I&#039;m not sure what topic I am feeling? Hopefully I will figure it all out soon. The last few weeks, I&#039;ve been trying to read articles and books, and that&#039;s been getting nowhere. Today, I began really looking at Wikipedia for myself and trying to make up my own conclusions, and that&#039;s made me feel better, even though I&#039;m not sure if i can sustain a 20 page paper on it, especially if it&#039;s a 20 page paper that I&#039;m not even sure will lead to a thesis. If i could know what I want to do it on I would, but I don&#039;t. I wish I could force it and just be happy about it but i can.&lt;/p&gt;
