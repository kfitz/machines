 <description>&lt;p&gt;Good call, ghostwriter. I think this is an issue that really needs to see the glorious light of day. I go by bubbleboy14 because I took a bubble bath when I was a baby, and have since been known as &quot;bubbleboy.&quot; Additionally, I got the internet when I was 14, so &quot;bubbleboy14&quot; was my first aol screen name.&lt;br /&gt;
	This screen name has seen a lot of action, no kidding. It was bubbleboy14, after all, who first talked to strangers on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;
:-*&lt;/p&gt;
