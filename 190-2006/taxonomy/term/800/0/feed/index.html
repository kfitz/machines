 <title>iran is kind of bad</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/702</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Iran joined the ranks of awful countries that block YouTube. It makes me kind of mad. Iran isn&#039;t a very good country, it turns out. I don&#039;t mind that they&#039;re trying to build a nuke that could kill me and everyone I hold dear, but YouTube is serious business, and I can&#039;t respect any nation that prevents her citizens from using it. They also block tons of blogs and basically any website that speaks ill of the current regime. How awful.&lt;br /&gt;
	The thing is, Iran is a vibrant, youthful country that would benefit from a little more open dialog. I mean, last week Chad imposed some hard-core censorship, but they only did it to stem the massive bloodshed that&#039;s spilling into their country from Sudan. But Iran doesn&#039;t have those concerns. It&#039;s really a pretty stable place. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>so today</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/675</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to read a .ichat file, and it basically wasn&#039;t worth it at all. The file was just full of all these awful, unreadable characters. Why can&#039;t ichat just be reasonable for a change?&lt;br /&gt;
	The worst part is, it was a conversation between a pretty young internet girl and a post-middle-aged man about something really boring and possibly academic. It sort of reminds me of the Dateline-NBC pedasnatchers. I wonder if she&#039;s involved with the Pervert Justice team?&lt;br /&gt;
	I guess eventually I&#039;ll read it. I just don&#039;t have the time or energy right now, and I won&#039;t for at least 5 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;
