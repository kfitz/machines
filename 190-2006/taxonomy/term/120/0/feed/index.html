 <title>you guys should really delete your facebook accounts</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;seriously. facebook is very stupid. i&#039;m glad people are finally starting to realize that, you know, no one will ever care about facebook until you&#039;re on trial for multiple church arson. a friend of mine at berkeley used his e-mail address (gpd@berkeley.edu - e-mail him your thanks and praise) to set up a facebook account for a fictional person named Gloria Dane. Although she didn&#039;t exist in the strictest sense, she was very popular on facebook, where every day her facebook mail was flooded with new invitations from the hosts of upcoming parties, the leadership of exclusive clubs, and the legions of facebook friend hopefuls.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Woo Hoo</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/125</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just watched an amazing movie entitled &quot;Face/Off&quot;.  It stars John Travolta and Nicholas cage in what might be the awesome height of their careers.  It involves doctors taking the face....off.  (The term &quot;Face...off&quot; is overly used in the film to the point of self-masichism and punching anyone who is within punching distance in the face.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, this marvelous work of film was directed by the One and Only John Woo.  I happened to notice that, in one of the scenes, there are doves fluttering around a church, often framed in slow motion flapping their wings across the screen.  This also happens in John Woo&#039;s Mission Impossible II.  This makes me wonder if the dove/white bird thing is a John Woo signature, and whether or not that makes him an &quot;auteur&quot;.  John Woo is well known for action films, but is that enough to make him an esteemed &quot;auteur&quot;?  What about his tendency for slow motion?&lt;/p&gt;
