 <title>thoughts on video games of the oppressed</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/399</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I meant to post on this a few days ago...but here goes! When I first read the introductory paragraph for Frasca&#039;s article, &quot;Video Games of te Oppressed&quot;, I became intriged by the notion that video games have the potential to be a tool of social justice and tolerance. Though he mentions social justice, he doesn&#039;t explain it as a concep The word oppressed pretty much comes in the title, and in references to Boal&#039;s and Freire&#039;s works. Oppression, social justice, and tolerance become buzz words he throws around, and his analysis of how they can be addressed in video games seemed shallow to me as a result. While I liked how he talked abot Boal&#039;s theories about how theatre is a tool for  debate, not a goal or a solution in itself, and how it would be powerful to implement this philosophy in video games, his examples on what can be done did not live up to the grand ideas he was setting up. The examples of potential models of games, which he gives, seem to do little in addressing groups that have been institutionally marginalized. He doesn&#039;t really talk about these groups and their access to video games in general, which is salient to this issue. In an abstract way, one could argue that his proposed Pac-Man like game with bullies, invites dialogue about very real issues of how to deal with conflict. Likewise, his SIMS fantasy of an alcoholic mother character that you could merge with greenpeace activist, may also incite dialogue about issues of parenthood, substance abuse, and activism, and the plethora of different behaviors and personalities that could exist under these categories, which a user can use to modify the character. In a world where you&#039;re competing with Halo, and World of Warcraft, or whatever, would these games stand a chance?  Would they operate in a different space then mainstream games hold, like being mandatory in a classroom?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Virtual Vacations</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/392</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;Escape&quot; section of today&#039;s New York Times, there was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/travel/escapes/03second.html?_r=2&amp;amp;oref=slogin&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;.  The piece starts off with a description of an angry Ben Folds getting drunk on stage, shooting laser beams from his eyes, then attacking the audience with a light saber.  The author&#039;s avatar, Urge Gainsbourg (wtf?), &quot;vacations&quot; in &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; for the weekend, staying in an online version of Starwood Hotel&#039;s new Aloft hotel (which will appear in the real world in 2008).  According to Matt Gross, &quot;Aloft&#039;s arrival- on a digital tropical island somewhere in a vast virtual ocean- may itself signal the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; as a casual travel destination.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>BULLY</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/376</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, while watching South Park, I saw a preview for a new video game (for PlayStation 2) called &quot;Bully.&quot;  It looks like Harry Potter without the magic, and I just could not figure out for the life of me what the point of the game was.  The preview centered on &quot;the new kid&quot; as he met people at Bullworth Academy (the jocks, the nerds, the bullies, the hot girls, etc.) and I&#039;m assuming he takes up the &quot;stop bulling the nerds&quot; cause.  In any case, I found this interesting primarily because of the article in First Person titled &quot;Videogames of the Oppressed&quot; which advocated for a computer/video game based on the techniques used in &quot;Theater of the Oppressed.&quot;  Basically, the game/performance involves a lot of audience interaction and actors work &quot;undercover&quot; in the &quot;Forum Theater.&quot;  Frasca writes, &quot;Forums are created around a short play (5-10 minutes long), usually scripted on-site, and based on the suggestions of the participants.  The scene always enacts an oppressive situation, where the protagonist has to deal with powerful characters that do not let her achieve her goals...The scene is enacted without showing a solution to the problem.  After one representation, anybody in the audience can take over the role of the protagonist and suggest, through her acting, a solution that she thinks would break the oppression&quot; (88- whew!).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cartman is God</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/375</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&#039;m posting this primarily because I love South Park (as I know you are aware from my previous post), but I rushed back to my dorm last night to catch the new South Park episode and, by some miracle, it was about computer games again!  Specifically, the Nintendo Wii, which I find pretty cool, and which Cartman falls in love with.  We talked a bit about it last night, and I&#039;m pretty curious to see how this will affect video gaming/how realistic video games become (as someone said last night, &quot;Great, kids will be even better at shooting guns&quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re bored, or in need of your weekly&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Website for First Person</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/355</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For any of you who, like me, are sharing the book and tired of the inconvience, go to Electronic Book Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The whole thing is online (and there&#039;s new material as well). It actually makes a whole lot more sense to read it in this form given the content. It does what the paper version can only attempt to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI I&#039;m feally bad at the html tags so I have no idea whether the website will actually show up in this post. If not I&#039;ll try again.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>gimmick vs. thought provoking</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/349</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After I posted, I thought of another good example of how the relationship between form and content could either seem interesting or just gimicky.&lt;br /&gt;
I am reminded of the difference between the films, &quot;Time Code&quot; by Mike Figgis and &quot;Memento&quot; by Christopher Nolan. (Did I make a concsious choice in saying who the author of the film was? Did I preface the director over the screenwriter or vice versa? Well in both films, the director was the screenwriter, so no choice between the two had to be made!) Granted, I saw Time Code once when I was 14, so maybe if I watch it again my opinion would be different. In Time Code, the screen is divided into four segments, and in each segment the viewer simultaneously. The story deals with love, sex, infidelity, with people working within the entertainment industry. The structure in a way did make the story, in the sense, that in one frame we see a woman witnessing her girlfriend cheating on her (she hid a mic on her girlfriend somehow, and was listening to the sounds in her car) while in the other frame, we see the situation of the cheating. you can see different angles of the same stories, it&#039;s layered, etc. Howver, I felt that this story didn&#039;t complement the structure well enough. It was just kind of a soap opera-y tale of people working in Hollywood. While the content was enhanced by the structure, in didn&#039;t take full advantage of the unique structure.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>more form and content stuff</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/348</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When reading First Person, I immediately noticed the layout. For a book addressing issues of new media, merging forms of storytelling, it felt that the layout was designed to somewhat reflect that. At the tops of each page, is the name of the section and the name of the authors and reponders, positioned in a way where the text looks like links. There were other ways where the layout reminded me of a web page. Unlike other books, where the responses to an article would be merely posted after the article, here they are posted simultaneously with the article, on the bottom third of the page. This is interesting because while I was reading the article, I was visually reminded that there were multiple point of views to this topic, instead of being completely immersed in the text at hand as the end all be all. In a way, the reader is presented with the multitude of possibilities, that Murray is so fond of, in the reading experience. Also, since the responses didn&#039;t come directly at the end, after I read the article, I would have to turn back the pages and start over. This reminded me of being on a poorly designed page, where I would have to always press the back button after reading something to get back to the menu. In this way, the reading of the book isn&#039;t exactly a linear process. In addition to this, the articles are divided in columns, which is reminiscent of a newsletter or a newspaper, so it&#039;s like a combination of thesis different mediums born of different eras.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>preliminary reading thoughts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/342</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m having a really hard time reading First Person. That&#039;s because I don&#039;t own it and Lindsay is being pretty stingy with letting me borrow hers. From what I have read, which is some mind you, I am pretty sure this book was written by videogame fanatics for other, equally academically inclined videogame fanatics. I have never been really into computer games since i broke the floppy for prince of persia, unless you count the first semester fo my freshman year when I played Snood to ease the pain. That being said, I understand how rapidly the market for computer games is growing I&#039;m baffled by it, but I know that it&#039;s happening. Still, reading people&#039;s in depth analysis of computer games is a struggle for me. It could be that I&#039;m being closed-minded and considering videogames to be low art. I mean, I have no problem listening to people discuss film or television at length. But when I&#039;m reading these essays in First Person, all I can do is picture the &quot;computer kids&quot; from high school sitting in the cafeteria discussing this stuff, except now they&#039;re in their 20s and their awful beards are beginning to show signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;
