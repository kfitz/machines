 <title>Jill Greenberg: Child Torturer??? Noooo....</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/477</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Gwen Stefani&#039;s new promo pictures came out yesterday, they feature a portrait of Stefani crying. Anyhow, the artist/photographer reponsible, Jill Greenberg (the manipulator) was recently accused of tormenting the children she also photographed in crying portraits for her latest exhibit, End Times. She says she only took a lollipop away form them. Anyhow, I took a look at at her work...and was suitably impressed. The way she captured the genuine sadness and almost agony in the children from supposedly simply having a candy taken away is amazing. I took a look at Gwen&#039;s promo pic for &quot;Sweet Escape&quot; and found that much of what I had liked about her exibition work with the children was lost, and that the promo shot turned into a contived piece for publicity. Its still beautiful...just not authentic. But good for her, i&#039;m sure she got good money for it.&lt;/p&gt;
