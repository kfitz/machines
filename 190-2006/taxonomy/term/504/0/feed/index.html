 <title>More on the screenwriter right to fight</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/453</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the last screenwriting blog.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always felt that screenwriters don&#039;t get enough credit for the work they put into a film. It has always seemed unjust to me that film they are portrayed as having a minimal role in the creation of the film.  I am definitely the type of person that will judge a movie  based off the screen play.  I will hate a movie because of poorly crafted dialogue, just as I will a song with bad lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;
This could easily be a contested statement, but I feel like outside of film studies analysis, the movies that really capture people are those with original plot line, characters and dialogue.  While original screenplays are heavily tweaked by the time of finished product, the creative vehicle behind the whole thing is still the screenplay.  Movies like the Royal Tenenbaums where there is something genius in the construction of the characters are more about screen play to me than direction. Although that is probably a poor example because the direction in that movie is pretty wondrous.  But then, in that example, Wes Anderson was the Writer/director/ creative vision instigator.  I think that is true of many quality films.  They are the babies of the director who see them through from concept to creation.  Plus this is how most people begin their film careers.  In lowly basements composing their master pieces to be shot on home movie cameras.  I think when I was younger and envisioned a future in film this is what I really imagined.  I used to say I wanted to be a screenwriter, but I didn&#039;t ever imagine that meant giving my creative process to some director to butcher until I didn&#039;t recognize it anymore.  I just can&#039;t understand how those screenwriters handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
