 <title>education and funny commercials</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/403</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else seen that commercial for what appears to be a leap frog type educational video game, in which the gray star wars looking monster puts down his weapon true Gandhi style.  It starts out with a kid playing a shoot-um up video game than the monster/freak turns around and is all, &quot;I can&#039;t do this there are kids watching, I am out of here&quot;. Then it goes on to say make your kids play our educational skill building video games.  Yeah.  It is pretty pretty pretty funny.  It did make me think about how potentially successful educational video games can be.  Of course, there are the dry ones that no kid is really going to play when presented with other alternatives for spending their time, like eating green ketchup.&lt;/p&gt;
