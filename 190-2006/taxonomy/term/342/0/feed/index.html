 <title>More on Internet TV</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/308</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to Ghostwriters blog about online television.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is specifically in reference to the NBC and ABC shows that are being broadcast online.  I have gone to these network websites for a little late night Grey&#039;s or Lost action.  I think it is great that they broadcast these and can see that this is the direction television seems to be heading. (last year when they first announced the broadcasts I was beyond stocked.)&lt;br /&gt;
The other day I looked at this graph which predicted the growth of internet use for daily tasks such as shopping, television watching and so on.  It showed that this growth has been exponential for the last several years.  It is however predicted that within the next 10 years there will be a major surge.  This isn&#039;t surprising, it is actually very obvious but it was still an interesting graph to look at.  Everyday people are growing more comfortable with the internet, but we still get a skewed view of this trend because we are in a young tech-savvy college environment.  Once American citizens as a whole reach a point of comfort with the internet, use for every day activities is predicted to surge because of a snowball effect.  If you neighbor is using the internet to buy their groceries and it is turning out well for them, suddenly you may jump on board.&lt;/p&gt;
