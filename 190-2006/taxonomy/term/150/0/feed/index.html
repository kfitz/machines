 <title>Save the children(&#039;s television)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/144</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the summer I worked for a children&#039;s television production company in England called Granada Kids.  We primarily produced television shows for ITV which is England&#039;s second major television network channel following the BBC.  The BBC is government funded while ITV is commercial.  While I was working at Granada the department was told it was to be shut down.  ITV was no longer making enough profit from children&#039;s television to sustain development and production of new shows.  They are going to continue making game shows because of the low budget nature, but all other children&#039;s television programming was going to be cancelled by next spring.  As far as public television goes this leaves the BBC with a monopoly on children&#039;s programming.&lt;/p&gt;
