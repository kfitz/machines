 <title>The Passion</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/158</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I talked in class the other day (maybe it was two weeks ago?) about Jeanette Winterson during a discussion on gender &amp;amp; literature.  To paraphrase the discussion, we were basically wondering whether its posisble for a male writer to write a successful female narrator, and vice versa; I mentioned that Jeanette Winterson comes close to doing this in one book, &quot;Written on the Body&quot;, where she writes as a gender-ambiguous voice throughout the entire book.  I forgot to mention Winterson&#039;s &quot;The Passion&quot;, where she uses a male narrator throughout the book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, I think, is her most acclaimed.  The book, as the title suggests, is about passion, and it manifests in various incarnations throughout the book including Henri&#039;s (Winterson&#039;s male narrator) own passion for a woman named Villanelle.&lt;/p&gt;
