 <title>Project Web-sites?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/615</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if anyone else is doing a web-based project for this class that we could all see, but I just thought I&#039;d post a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.pomona.edu/~at002003/Senior%20Project/Dreamweaver%20Pages/Front%20Page.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to mine in case anyone was interested...  If anyone else did anything we could see on the web, you should post it!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>On the project tip</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/196</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a question for you. I have already submitted my Senior Project proposal, but since I haven&#039;t really done anything other than broadly outline it and contact a few people that would be in it, nothing is concrete as of yet. I was wondering what you thought about the three possiblities that keep me awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- Capturing DJ culture in LA. Here, I would interview DJs that occupy different realms of the art/business. I would talk to radio djs, turntablist djs, and club djs and see what similarities and differences exist between them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- An indepth portrait of Egon. He is the manager of the biggest independent hiphop label in the world - Stones Throw. Not only is he an amazing DJ, but he takes great photographs, and writes for a hiphop magazine. I assume he&#039;ll be busy, but it would be cool to get a glimpse of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
