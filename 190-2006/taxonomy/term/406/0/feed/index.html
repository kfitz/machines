 <title>i heart youtube</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/707</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;youtube has made the last week bearable and livable for me. it has definitely become a part of my repertoire of sites i always check when i go online (e-mail, facebook, myspace, wikipedia, nytimes, and now youtube). i think it&#039;s cool that it&#039;s sort of become like a reference source. for instance, if someone makes a crazy appearance on a tv show, youtube it. you can catch up on stuff in your own pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the newest thing i like about is how people in video classes are putting their stuff up (like some folks in this class). it&#039;s a cool space to show your work because on one hand there&#039;s the potential that lots of people can see it. on the otherhand, it&#039;s not an intimidating place because there are so many videos that range from being almost professional to just being home videos. i would feel less self conscious to post my stuff on youtube because i can comfortably fall within that huge range. also, there&#039;s the anonymous nature of it. in my video classes, i would always dread critiques (even though in the end i did enjoy them). they were nervewracking because i&#039;m putting myself on the line, everyone knows me, my past work, and i&#039;m seeing people as they watch my work, as they critique my stuff. on youtube, though similar dialogues can happen, there&#039;s a distance, that for me, makes it more comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mashed Potatoes and Beatles</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/513</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The recently released Beatles album entitled Love has got me thinking... and blogging. Though I have yet to hear the entire album, Love is a mash-up of old Beatles songs which was created as the soundtrack for a Las Vegas stage show featuring Cirque du Soleil.  The album was produced by the slicing and dicing of the Beatles catalog primarily from the years of 1963-1970 and features songs which mix elements of Penny Lane with Strawberry Fields Forever or one song that uses the guitar riff from Blackbirds as the introduction to Yesterday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOVE is an interesting example of the 21st century phenomenon of &quot;mashing&quot; because unlike most mash-ups, the record is comprised of Beatles music and Beatles music only and made with the  explicit authorization of the group.  But some fans are wondering if the manipulation and reconstruction of the Beatles&#039; music is sacrilege?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>MS is the the Stuff!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/373</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever just looked around in one of your media studies classes and thought to yourself, &quot;is this actually happening?&quot; Did I seriously get to watch Youtube and talk about video games for 2 and a half hours yesterday and call that class? Wow, did I ever choose the right major. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a small blog to rejoyce in the fact that instead of learning about the constitution, supply and demand, or memorizing the periodic table of elements, I am watching &quot;hologrinding&quot; in a galaxy far, far, away. Man, isn&#039;t Media Studies just the shit sometimes?&lt;/p&gt;
