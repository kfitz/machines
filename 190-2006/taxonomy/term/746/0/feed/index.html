 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/arts/television/12mana.html?_r=1&amp;amp;8dpc&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;omg i am trying to make a blog tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there, hopefully is a link to a NYT article i just stumbled on while distracting myself from writing final papers. and now i&#039;m blogging as distraction from other work, oh how i rue finals week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but this article is still ridiculous to me -- firstly, that this entire new joke/hype was all out of a kneejerk reaction  to avoid lawsuits... it just seemed super timely that an article like this popped up, when i find myself wondering how exactly the digital world influences the production of media (my other paper thats on my plate right now is how tv affects societal perceptions of polygamy, so horny manatees are way more fun to read about for the time being). it&#039;s just still so crazy to me how much advertisement and savviness has to go into digital responses and promotions and everything that gets tied along with any sort of media today. every movie and tv show has an official website, not to mention how everything written in relation to a show is also online - and soon enough the show itself might exist primarily on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
