 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just thinking today about the tripod.com Nirvana website I made when I was in 7th grade and decided to set out to look for it.  When I found it I was startled-- when was I in 7th grade, 1998?  And its still around?  I explored a little bit-- of course I had no webspace of my own back then, so all of the linked photographs were gone, but a lot of the content still remained: guitar tabs for all of Nirvana&#039;s albums are still up, as are the lyrics for a couple of them, and the text from Kurt&#039;s suicide note.  The most interesting thing I re-discovered was the guestbook.  The latest entry was from July of 2006-- WHAT??&lt;/p&gt;
