 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, I get e-mails from this website now and then. It occured to me that some of you may want to check it out if you haven&#039;t heard of it.  I think it is an interesting site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called Witness and the URL is http://www.witness.org/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From their about us:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;WITNESS uses the power of video to open the eyes of the world to human rights abuses. By partnering with local organizations around the globe, WITNESS empowers human rights defenders to use video to shine a light on those most affected by human rights violations, and to transform personal stories of abuse into powerful tools of justice. Over the past decade, WITNESS has partnered with groups in more than 60 countries, bringing often unseen images, untold stories and seldom heard voices to the attention of key decision makers, the media, and the general public -- catalyzing grassroots activism, political engagement, and lasting change.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
