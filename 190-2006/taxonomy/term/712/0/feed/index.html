 <title>Death and Taxes (and 3D space)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/600</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the old Ben Franklin quote that &quot;nothing is certain but death and taxes&quot; will become applicable in a new way. That&#039;s right folks, governments are beginning to think about taxing virtual assets that people acquire in virtual worlds like &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;. I came across this &lt;a&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on cnet.com, which talks about the State of Play/Terra Nova symposium, a yearly conference that is held to discuss the social and economic implications of virtual worlds. According to one of the economist quoted in the article, &quot;given growth rates of 10 to 15 percent a month, the question is when, not if, Congress and IRS start paying attention to these issues.&quot; The article goes on to talk about estate taxes, and a report that&#039;s been commissioned for next year by the Joint Economic Committee, which will probably really get the ball rolling on all of this. The article definitely gives the sense that taxing virtual assets is inevitable (I mean, that&#039;s basically the article&#039;s title) and is something we shouldn&#039;t be surprised to see in the future. It&#039;s really interesting to see the wide scope of virtual worlds, how they have economies and other aspects that we typically attribute only to the real world. It will also be interesting to see how institutions in the real world will have to learn to interact will virtual worlds, and how we might reconcile the real and the hyperreal.&lt;/p&gt;
