 <title>a message from there-is-no-god</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you guys ever looked up at the stars and wondered whether Mark Foley would respond if you sent Maf54 an instant message?&lt;br /&gt;
	It turns out, former Republican Senator Mark Foley is even cooler than I suspected. Why, you ask? What could possibly make him any more awesome than he already clearly is? He&#039;s involved with the Church of Scientology!&lt;br /&gt;
	Scientology is so cool. Those guys are great. I want to be a Scientologist when I grow up. Of course, I&#039;ll have to become a millionaire first. But once those two criteria are met, it will be smooth sailing. Rich Scientologists have armies of slaves. It&#039;s so great. They should just call their religion &quot;capitalism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Let&#039;s Play Monopoly</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/257</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading about the comics industry online when I came across an interesting story. Diamond Comics is the largest comics distributor in North America. They have exclusive distribution deals with the four major U.S. comics companies (Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, and Image), and as a result, most comic book stores are forced to deal with Diamond whether they want to or not. Basically, they have a monopoly on North American comics distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, the Department of Justice started an antitrust investigation against them. The investigation ended in 2000 and Diamond suffered no consequences because although the investigation found that they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a monopoly on comics distribution, they don&#039;t have a monopoly on the distribution of all books.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Economies of film</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/108</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While reading the article &quot;Making Films Asian American,&quot; by Sarah Projansky and Kent A. Ono, I found one aspect very interesting.  The article focused alot on the economic side of cinematic production, an issue I think has been largely overlooked in other essays but nonetheless is a vital factor in this question of authorship. The article asserts that among other things, the filmmaker is &quot;a laborer within global capitalist economy that continually masks the relationship between workers and products.&quot;  I think the economic setting in which a film or any form of cultural text is created can potentially have a huge effect on the ways in which authorship is percieved. As the article states on pg. 266, &quot;The flight from the auteur as sanctified origin of textual meaning parallels the postmodern cultural effect of libertating products from any and all sites of production and cultural contexts...labor is alienated from the existential moment of human production and products forever circulate as exchange value versus use value.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
