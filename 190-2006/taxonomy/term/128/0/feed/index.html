 <title>One for the ego...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, the small little example of &quot;Eliza&quot; and the quite limited interactions we could develop with her made me think about how I am so glad that the chats I have are with fellow human beings. Also, as I was walking home, I was thinking about chat sessions and if it&#039;s possible to find some merit in it as a literary form.   Based on my own personal experiences, I know this sounds kind of like an ego-trip, but I admit that I have saved past chat sessions which I believe deserved to be recorded and stored. Whether I was able to reach some type of higher thought with the person I chatted with, or whether we were able to develop a witty conversation that could even have a narrative structure, I thought it was imperative that I did save these enlightening chat sessions. As I was walking back to my room I thought of it might be of real interest to examine chat sessions in the light of the discussion we have been having in class regarding authroship. Can a chat session be looked at as a literary form that deserves a place in this debate of authorship? What does the ability to save a chat session influence its authenticity as a literary document?&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if this really deals with authorship but it does deal with media studies. I live in a suite with some friends and one of them got a wireless router thing. Tonight there were four of us in someone&#039;s room, and we all had our laptops and were connected to the wireless and began chatting on aol. For some reason it was infinitely more satisfying to be chatting online with people when they&#039;re in the room with you, than having an actual conversation or talking on AIM when you&#039;re not together. I would type something and look up at the person i just typed to. Or we would have a speaking conversation and would be typing to each other at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
