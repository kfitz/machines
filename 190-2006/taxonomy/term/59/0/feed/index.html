 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I find myself up against &#039;the man&#039; again. Only now I realize no good can come from continuing to avoid it, so now I am going to attempt to &quot;get on it&quot; as KFitz suggested-- only I am not sure what to get on really. (Thus the basis of my reluctance to even start) I find myself again (in a very karmic way) with this dilemma of blogging, and my stubborn determination AGAINST it. I can whip up responses to readings and edit them and print them out and hand them in -- that I&#039;ve been trained to get done, no problem--. But now we have moved beyond that teacher-paper-student connection and now it&#039;s something online, on a screen that is being published for the critical eyes of an entire whole class to see, and it&#039;s on the WORLDwide web so that&#039;s a new layer of publishing-- and hey, it seems I&#039;m totally scared of authorship.  Whew, naming it is the first step to overcoming it, yea?&lt;/p&gt;
