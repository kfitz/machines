 <title>I like highlighting better than underlining</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just have a couple of things I&#039;ve noticed in the reading that I want to expand upon briefly. First, is Siva&#039;s description of Diogenes, the Greek dude who he calls the first cynic, and says masturbated in the marketplace. He describes this man saying, &quot;He engaged powerful people in playful debate, often exposing their hypocrisy&quot; (25). Who does this sound like in our contemporary society? Why, none other than Sacha Baron Cohen. Through his many characters, including Ali G and Borat, he seems to be carrying on this cynical tradition (by Siva&#039;s definition). Every subsequent sentence describing the guy then sounds like it could be describing Ali G, and come on, if you heard that any celebrity had masturbated in the marketplace these days, wouldn&#039;t mind immediately jump to Baron Cohen. Hell, he sort of did it in the Borat movie. I just thought this was an interesting parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>More of the sexy time with Borat</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/444</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For anyone that is interested in the Borat lawsuit debates going on right now there was an article on AOL this morning about the issue. Here is the link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though typically I am all for making fun of ignorant people, I draw the line with the old Jewish couple. How could you possibly take advantage of them like that and feel ok about it.  They open up their home to Borat and his crew and make them a late night snack , and what do they get in return? They are portrayed as money grubbing Jews who have morphed into cockroaches.&lt;/p&gt;
