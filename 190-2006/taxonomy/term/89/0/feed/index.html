 <title>Stigwood</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/106</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed reading the chapter by Michael deAngelis about Robert Stigwood.  This was for two reasons. The first was, I kept singing &quot;Jesus Christ Super Star&quot; as I read and the second, because I found it interesting to think about authorship with a black and white consumer driven mentality.  The Stigwood approach on authorship isn&#039;t anywhere near that gray area, ambiguous, dead, dying, terminally ill media studies analysis of author.  This authorship is the cold, rational economy driven author who sacrifices high art for high pay check.  And really, it is these &quot;authors&quot; these money makers, that are controlling the media.  They have the power because they have the money.  They have the money because they aren&#039;t trying to write what is most revolutionary and innovative but rather what has the most audience appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
