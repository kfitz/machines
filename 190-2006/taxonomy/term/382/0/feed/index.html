 <title>I want The Sims</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/346</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When reading through First Person, I noticed that two of the authors provided conflicting analysis of the consumerism aspect of The Sims.  In &quot;Video Games of the Oppressed&quot;, Frasca says, &quot;The consumerist ideology that drives the simulation is nothing short of disturbing:  the amount of friends that you have literally depends on the number of goods that you own.&quot; I couldn&#039;t find the other quote, but it came later in the book with the author taking the stand that The Sims produces feelings of strong anti-consumerism.  Buying more things means working harder to get them. If you get your litl brat too many toys they may become spoiled.  If you buy a huge crib you have to pay for someone to take care of it ect.&lt;/p&gt;
