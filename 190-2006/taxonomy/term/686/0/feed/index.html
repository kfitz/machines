 <description>&lt;p&gt;With much resistance at first, I have now succumbled fully to the ipod revolution. I was really put off my the advertisements at first. in the Bay Area, at some BART (Subway-like public transportation) stations, the platforms would be covered with IPOD ads. You couldn&#039;t go anywhere without seeing those  Even though there are definite faults (it&#039;s expensive, the battery-life is ridiculously not what they advertise, etc.), I love my ipod. it&#039;s just crazy to have so much of my music available at once. I used to carry my discman everywhere with me, and would have a cd case that could hold 10 CDs. I&#039;d carefully pick my selections before going out, etc. so having it all easibly accessible in this tiny little thing was awesome. I even have ipod accessories, such as portable speakers. my ipod allegiance is pretty pricey though for me it&#039;s been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
