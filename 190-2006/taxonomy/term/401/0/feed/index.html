 <title>RefWorks saved my life. ...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I dont know if Pomona offers RefWorks workshops or if most of you already know how and have used RefWorks to organize your sources and make bibliogrpahies. All I know is that when my friend came in after attending and ITS workshop for RefWOrks (she works at ITS at CMC)she showed me a time/lifesaver. For those of you that dont know, I suggest that you go to RefWorks and make an account ASAP. We may have talked about it in class already, but I believe I may have missed that day. If we havent, maybe Prof. Fitzpatrick could get someone to show the class how to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is RefWorks? (found on the home page at RefWorks.com)&lt;/p&gt;
