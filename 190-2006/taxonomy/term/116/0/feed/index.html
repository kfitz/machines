 <title>Why did you choose to major in MS?</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;This should probably be taken with a grain of salt. Finals make me cranky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But-- I&#039;m beginning to wonder what exactly is so critical about critical studies. The TSL writes, &quot;You say post-modern structuralism, I say meaningless bullshit,&quot; and maybe they have a point. A lot of the things we talk about from critical theory seem a little circular and detached from the real world. &quot;What is art?&quot; for example. We will never come up with a definition upon which we can all agree; so why, over the course of the course of four years, have I probably wasted about 5 class hours discussing this question and am actually still kind of confused whether this would be a question that would even be considered part of critical studies? (The economist in me is about to come out .. sorry guys!) With tuition at about $31,000, each class hour comes out to about $120. That means I have spent $600 trying (to no avail) to pinpoint what is art. Is this worth it? What do you guys think about our field of study? What topics frustrate you? What has excited you? Why did you choose to be media studies majors in the first place and what has kept you here?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Art</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/123</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s really sort of interesting that the whole Lonelygirl15 stunt was just internet hype for a movie that will be wildly popular with internet people who will just torrent it anyway instead of shelling out anything to see it in a theater. It&#039;s just like Snakes on a Plane, which I saw at a drive-in pretty recently. It was so bad, I considered walking home midway through. It was not fun or funny. It was just long and unpleasant. However, contrary to the sworn testimony of one of three witnesses called by reliablesrc07, it is art. It&#039;s just not good. It&#039;s the awful product of awful artists, like Yoko Ono.&lt;/p&gt;
