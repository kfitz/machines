 <title>Plastic surgery</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/657</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to Snaggle Tooth = Social Suicide and Spinsterhood, I&#039;d like bring up an artist who turns on its head this idea of having to look a certain way (and having to go through cosmetic dentistry or surgery or what have you to get there). I don&#039;t know if any of you have heard of Orlan but she&#039;s definitely one of the most provocative artists I know of. Her art is her face. She undergoes cosmetic operations to contort her face in ways that are completely foreign to the operations we usually encounter. For her, a nose job might make her nose enormous or she may try to copy the Roman nose. The surgery that stood out most to me when I got to see her give a lecture in LA last spring were two enormous implants, one at each temple (she had decorated them with glitter for the lecture). Orlan undergoes the entire operation while remaining conscious and even talking. She has the &quot;performance&quot; telecasted to select places around the world. The art is pretty gruesome to watch but that definitely is part of her point.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>cosmetic plastic surgery</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/102</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked up a magazine while I was getting a haircut the other day (Glamour or Allure or one of those), and I was surprised to see a whole section devoted to cosmetic surgery.  I was even more surprised to see statistics like &quot;60% of women now approve of cosmetic surgery, 18% more than last year&quot; were seen in a positive light - isn&#039;t it great that women finally feel empowered enough to take a knife to their ugly noses?  The magazine, along with Christina Hoff Sommers&#039; speech at CMC (The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism is Harming Our Young Men) got me thinking about the original authors of the term &quot;feminism&quot; - and how the term has leapt from them and taken on several contasting connotations of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
