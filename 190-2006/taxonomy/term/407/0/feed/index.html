 <title>BECK</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/431</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have recently become the owner of Beck&#039;s recently released album, The Information.  As a devoted fan and future girlfriend of Beck, I felt required to post on its awesomeness. Aside from being his best album since Odelay, Beck has outdone himself yet again on originality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part actually has to do with our class so pay attention. The Information was released as a CD/DVD combo and the DVD features a music video to accompany each song.  I read a review prior to the release of the CD which annoys me now because I can&#039;t remember where I read it and also can&#039;t remember all that Beck said about the album. However, I do remember that he said he had been wanting to do a CD/DVD combo for a long time now because he thinks that it comes closer to how we should experience music, as this totally sensationally stimulating medium. Kinda interesting in terms of our recent discussion about the level of immersion allowed by new media forms.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ADS ADS ADS</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/374</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got my take home mid-term for my other media studies class and I had to share it with you.  The first half of the mid-term is pretty typical. Upon selecting a scene from a current TV show, you have to write a 2-3 page essay imagining what it would be like if you were seeing that scene 40 years ago and what would be controversial or groundbreaking about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of the mid-term is a little more interesting. We have to watch a solid hour of TV and write down every ad that we see during the commercial breaks while taking brief notes about what the ad is selling, who is represented in the ad etc. Then we have to organize this list of ads into groups based on the product i.e. beer, cars etc. and then we have to organize the list into  subgroups based on what is being represented in the ad and who is the target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
