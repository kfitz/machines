 <title>Punk&#039;d</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/540</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a very intelligent lunch conversation with peers about the MTV show Punk&#039;d. For those of you who don&#039;t know, Punk&#039;d is a show that Ashton Kutcher started that is kind of similar to Candid Camera, but with celebrities. Kutcher hires actors to put celebrities in really ridiculous situations and usually worries them or makes them very angry and then walks out and laughs at them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, our conversation began because someone had recently seen an episode in which Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey on Grey&#039;s Anatomy) was punked and said some pretty weird things.  The episode involved a waitress (actress) hitting on Pompeo&#039;s fiance while serving them lunch. Pompeo goes on to say some pretty malicious stuff about stabbing the woman and watching her bleed everywhere.  Pretty weird.  The link to that on YouTube is here:&lt;/p&gt;
