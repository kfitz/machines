 <title>YouTube in the New York Times</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/454</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw that rainian tried to post this article but the link didnt work. since I was going to blog about it anyway, here is the url http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/magazine/12youtube.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;_r=1. The articles name is &quot;The Online Auteurs.&quot; How appropriate for the course. Anyway, onto my comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    I can understand hesitation felt towards the growth of YouTube. On the otherhand, I appreciate its positive value for those creators who chose to upload their work for others to see. With the increase in accessibilty to video production equipment, anyone can chose to make their own videos. All that YouTube allows is for these authors to have the opportunity to have their material be seen by an potentially large number of people. It provides an alternate route for authors to gain recognition, and in some cases, possibly get picked up by larger production companies that may afford the authors a greater budget and better equipment to develop their ideas. While this may not be the case for all the video makers on YouTube, there are always going to be those people who hope to get &quot;discovered&quot; this way. I hate to reduce YouTube to the new version of &quot;moving-to-LA-and-become-a-waiter/waitress-in-hopes-of-&quot;making&quot;-it-BIG&quot; but it certainly could turn into that for some people. And for those whose hoeps arent neccessarily that grand, they may be able to gain that niche audience. There has always been something to be said about the &quot;hip&quot; quality of &quot;indie&quot; or underground material. SO theres always that.&lt;/p&gt;
