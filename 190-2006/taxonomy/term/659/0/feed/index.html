 <title>Should we ditch Jar Jar Binks?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/562</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I definitely would have concerns for what would happen to artists if copyright laws were completely abandoned, I&#039;m not entirely convinced that they do more good than they do harm. Whether they last for 75 years after the artist&#039;s death, or just 75 minutes, what is the point in prohibiting others from taking your work and making it (possibly) better? Yes, I know that sentence sounds strange. But seriously, if &quot;Star Wars&quot; is made better by excluding Jar Jar Binks, and consequently the maker of the Star Wars/The Phantom Edit profits from his improvement on the film, maybe by allowing this sort of freedom we will actually be encouraging artists to make their work even better the first time around to prevent people from taking it, tweaking it, and selling it later.&lt;/p&gt;
