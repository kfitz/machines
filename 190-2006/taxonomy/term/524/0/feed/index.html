 <title>O.J. the author</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/463</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hate computers... I just wrote this really long blog about this and accidentally hit the back button and lost it all. Anyway, I&#039;ll try again and it probably won&#039;t be nearly as well written since I have class in 10 minutes, but oh, well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently heard that O.J. Simpson has turned author.  However, his writing is not a straight up autobiography or anything like that.  He wrote a hypothetical book about how he would have killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, had he done it.  Not really a confession, yet not really a good way of clearing his name.  In addition, he has taped an interview that will air at the end of the month that goes over the material in the book, describing how he would have executed the murders. Anyway, my initial reaction was mortification.  How can he write the gruesome details about how he would have killed his ex-wife and the mother of his children even if he had?? Doesn&#039;t he have a soul?  While this feeling still remains strong, I started thinking... he just wants to be back in the spotlight and this is a pretty unique and crazy way to get back in the spotlight.  He can&#039;t be charged for the crimes again, so why not hypothetically confess?? Other people wrote a million books about the trial and speculated what happened, why shouldn&#039;t O.J. author his own book and clear up exactly what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
