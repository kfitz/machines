 <title>Clearly, I&#039;m obsessed with Post Secret</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/354</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after that (quite overly-long) entry on Post Secret, I&#039;ve realized my mind is very much still churning. I&#039;ve now got on to thinking about authorship and Post Secret. In looking at authorship in relationship to Post Secret we are not only confronted by the interplay between authorship and intention but also by the fact that what we see in the Post Secret website and in the books has been touched by someone other than the secret-holders. Frank Warren is allowed to edit the submissions and print and post some submissions while leaving out others. On the books, he is listed as the sole author. (Of course, what other author could he possibly list since the whole point is that the postcards are sent anonymously???). Still, it is these anonymous authors&#039; words that I read in the books and on the website and I feel they are so much more the authors of Post Secret than Frank Warren. Really though, the only way I can justify to myself that he is credited as the author is by appointing him as the author of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Authorship and Intention (and some other random thoughts)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/353</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Post Secret is a website??? Why did you tell me this? This could be very bad... A friend of mine has the Post Secret book, and I found myself completely sucked in. Now I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll become addicted to the website too. (For those who didn&#039;t read the post earlier today on Authorship and the Internet, Post Secret is this thing where people send postcards to this guy named Frank Warren sharing their most personal secrets. Warren then selects which submissions to post in books and on the website. He is also allowed to edit the submissions if he wants to.) I get a weird feeling reading the postcards because if I met the authors, these would be things I would not be privy to, but somehow in the anonymous world of the internet it is ok that I know. Reading Post Secret is like finding a terribly juicy diary, itching to read it, and without reservation, giving in.&lt;/p&gt;
