    <div class="content"><p>Last night, as I was dilligently working away on thesis related stuff, a friend of mine decided that I needed a break. So she came over and brought her fiance and his friend. We were mostly playing video games and carrying on three conversations at once when my friend spotted my girlfriend's cell phone. It's one of those sleak, new "music phones". My friend immediately began to exclaim over the phone's cuteness and coolness, etc. She asked if my girlfriend had downloaded any music, which she hadn't because she didn't know how. So my friend brought out her phone to show her. My friend's phone, which she was given by a well-off friend who trades her's in every few months, was one of those cell/camera/mp3 player phones that flips open to reveal a larger screen, speakers, and a full qwerty keyboard. My girlfriend and I excalimed over the "sick"ness of her phone and she proceeded to extoll it's failings. Next thing I know everyone in the room had their phones out. Martinez (friend of fiance) was attempting to bluetooth his Razr to my friend's Sidekick to give her his ringtones, my friend was demonstrating to my girlfriend how to download media onto her phone, and fiance and I were comiserating about the realitve lameness of our phones.</p>

Apparently Apple is teaming up with several airlines, including United, Continental, Delta, and Air France, to offer, get this, IPOD CHARGERS AT YOUR SEAT!  And it doesn't stop there, the iPod will not only charge, but link up with the seat-back displays to let you watch your own videos, rather than having to watch The Lake House</em> and all that other quality in-flight entertainment.  I think this is great partly because I haven't learned how to properly preserve my battery power and my iPod usually dies right before I reach my destination.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>OK, so someone blogged about last week's episode of South Park and Cartman's anticipation of the new Nintendo Wii being released.  Well, South Park is amazing and I wanted to put something out there that was in that episode that everyone should know about. Some of you have probably heard about this already, but for those of you who haven't... it's pretty interesting.<br />
So in the episode, Mrs. Garrison is instructed to teach the class about evolution and has an issue teaching it to her students. Basically, there is a reference to believing in a Flying Spaghetti Monster as god.  This is not just a random South Park comment.  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists and it is actually quite popular.  Followers of the religion are called Pastafarians. A man named Bobby Henderson had an issue with a Kansas school district teaching the theory of Intelligent Design as well as evolution and wrote a letter to the school board about teaching all the various theories of Intelligent Design if they were going to teach any. He goes on to explain his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and how it should be taught in school. He explains that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth and placed all the evidence of evolution here. It was actually very detailed and included everything from diagrams to a graph explaining that the reason we have global warming is the due to the decrease in the number of pirates in the world since the 1800's.  Anyway, you can read the open letter at this site:</p>

I got one of my "CNN Breaking News" emails today, expecting to see something about the outcome of elections, how election day was going, or something like that.  No, what CNN feels is most important to tell me today, Election Day, is that Britney Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline.  And CNN is supposed to be one of the serious news sources that will tell me important information about the world.  While I see that some citizens view things such as Britney's love life as something more important that voting (maybe that's why we have such low voter turnouts), I would think that the CNN Breaking News Bulletins would be saved for something a little more academic or political and that people could find out stuff about Britney's divorce procedures on people.com ??</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Basically, I went on the Price is Right today and I need to blog more, so I am going to write about the experience and connect it to authorship. First of all, ridiculous people go on the Price is Right.  It was amazing... people from Florida with shirts that said "My Gator is Neutered" are a prime example.  Anyway, I went on the show with my rugby team (and a few friends of ruggers) and a girl on the team was picked (Angie Martinez, she goes to Pitzer).<br />
It got me thinking... I was reminded of our discussion of Authorship and Film because I got to see so many elements of the show happening, such as the cameras and all the crew running around to make sure everything was right.  It allowed me to see how many people really are involved in the process.  And also it got me thinking about the formulaic narratives we have been discussing with Hamlet on the Holodeck and First Person.  The Price is Right follows such a formula, it's almost ridiculous.  However, the audience plays a role in the outcome of the show and plays an important part in the show environment.  The contestants are picked from the audience and typically the members of the audience are frequent viewers, so the viewer is somewhat involved in the outcome of the show.  And while the producers pick who those selected audience members are, the audience is still involved in creating the atmosphere and helping the game players choose prices.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>not to be confused with Mark Z. Danielewski's <em>House of Leaves</em>. So basically, Dr. Phil has a new show called "House of Hatred" in which 6 very different people have to live in a house together, have their lives taped, and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real. Actually, that's "The Real World", but the idea is similar. But in Dr. Phil's house, the people are literally positioned as the binary opposite of another person in the house and forced to room with this person. Pair number 1 is the white supremacist guy and the black woman who hates white people, followed by the thin girl who hates fat people and the 600 lb man who hates thin people, and lastly the homophobe and the straight-hating lesbian. Everything about this premise just rubs me the wrong way. First of all, for a guy like Dr. Phil who's known for saying "Get real!", this is incredibly contrived, and the binaries are so extreme whereas in real life, issues of ignorance and/or hate are so much more complex than this. Which brings me to my second point, which is that it eschews any attempt at a more complex (and more relevant) discussion about difference in our society by reducing the housemates to representing one thing in a binary rather than as complete people. Plus the name of the show is pretty awful.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I'm posting this primarily because I love South Park (as I know you are aware from my previous post), but I rushed back to my dorm last night to catch the new South Park episode and, by some miracle, it was about computer games again!  Specifically, the Nintendo Wii, which I find pretty cool, and which Cartman falls in love with.  We talked a bit about it last night, and I'm pretty curious to see how this will affect video gaming/how realistic video games become (as someone said last night, "Great, kids will be even better at shooting guns").  </p>

    <div class="content"><p>The worst part about first person</p>
<p>is the pages. They're too thin. I'm pretty sure these pages wouldn't actually pass as paper in a court of law. They're more like the cheap toilet paper they had at my high school. The pages' absurd thinness makes the book too flimsy, and awkward to hold. But the worst part about the thinness of pages is that if you are, for example, on page 135, you'd be feeling pretty good about yourself with most books. First Person is a different story. If you're on 135, you are only a quarter inch through this thing.</p>
<p>This book is inaffective because it discourages slow readers like myself.</p>

<p>Join us on September 28th as immigrant workers begin a new stage of the immigrant rights movement by demanding that the hotels along Century Corridor provide good jobs that pay living wages and allow immigrant workers to rise out of poverty. Our march on Century Blvd. will culminate in hundreds of immigrants, workers, community members, clergy, students and other activists protesting in one of the largest acts of non-violent civil disobedience in the history of Los Angeles.</p>
