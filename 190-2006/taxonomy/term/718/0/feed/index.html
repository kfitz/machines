 <title>One time I thought I was smart and then I decided that no, I was obviously dumb for thinking that.</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Question:&lt;br /&gt;
How do I quote Wikipedia in my paper?  Can I do that?  Can I just say &quot;according to wikipedia&quot; blah or should I include some sort of footnote and treat it like a real encyclopedia article?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In other news I envy my rabbit, who has no idea how to write or even speak english but gets along just fine without having to deal with the travesties of academia.  Right now he is napping with his head on a newspaper article, which he has no idea how to read and probably doesn&#039;t even understand or interpret as &quot;newspaper&quot;; more likely he is more invested in its chewing qualities.  Most of my library books smell bad, but at this point I&#039;d rather eat them than read them.  So...in the vein of a David Lynch movie or Kafka narrative, I&#039;d like to turn into a rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
