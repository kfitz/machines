 <title>Intro to Computer Science</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/294</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m still in the earlier parts of the book, but I&#039;ve had some thoughts already regarding much of what Murray has been saying. Some background first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m taking Intro to Comp Sci mostly to fulfill an Area Requirement, but also because it counts toward Media Studies major requirements. Initially, I thought, &quot;Really? That doesn&#039;t make any sense!&quot; except for the fact that computers are a form of media, but we had never really discussed a theory of computers (that I recall) in any of my previous theory classes. As I explain to people who are as incredulous as I that I&#039;m taking this class, I&#039;m often met with similar reactions and frequently have to justify it. Sometimes it&#039;s hard. Because of the department&#039;s association with the Math department, it&#039;s prettyer similar to a math class. There&#039;s a lot of analytical thinking required and much of programming language (with which I am not at all well acquainted) is fairly obtuse. Additionally I had a real crisis of faith today after receiving a pretty terrible grade on my midterm exam. Why am I doing this, I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
