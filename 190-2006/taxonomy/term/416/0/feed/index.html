 <title>Globus Travel</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/525</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;OK seriously, I can&#039;t believe I keep blogging about magazines--this is the last one, I swear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sooo maybe I never made it all the way through Time magazine--you know, things to do, places to go, people to see, whatever, so I moved on to Budget Travel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sooner than I open up the magazine do I find something to blog about!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few pages of Budget Travel from November is a two-page ad for various vacations in Italy from &quot;the Globus family of vacations&quot; (four different travel package programs catering to independent, luxury, budget and-- I don&#039;t know, one more kind of traveler).  For some reason, all of their photographs of &quot;real Italy&quot; are totally ridiculous.  I mean, it shouldn&#039;t be possible to completely caricaturize, in so many different ways, a whole place in so few pictures.  These photographs feature all of the essentials: the backs of two pensive American travelers, stopped at an otherwise empty sidewalk cafÃ© in front of two empty cups of espresso (&quot;A Monograms independent vacation gives you all the time you need ot sip espresso and soak up local culture&quot;); a vineyard snaking over rolling Tuscan hills (&quot;Globus travelers enjoy a private wine tasting and lunch at the splendid Verrazzano Castle&quot;--as do Syracuse University study abroad students, incidentally); and photographs of a Venetian bridge, a few gondolas, and the Roman Coleseum.  What strikes me as strange about all of these pictures is the total lack (except for the espresso shot) of people; neither tourists nor Italians show up in any of these photographs.  Perhaps the purpose of this is to create a sense of intimacy with the sites that Globus is insinuating it is capable of delivering, but it&#039;s almost disconcerting, implying that the impetus of travel lies in the confrontation between the self and the site, not the confrontation of the self and, well, the whole package.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>BUST: for women with something to get off their chests</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/524</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know how many of you have heard of Bust magazine, but the WU has subscribed to it for a LONG time and I just started reading it.  At first I was hesitant, because it seemed ultra (bordering on militant) feminist, and that&#039;s just not my style.  But, since I started working as a co-fac and picking up the mail, I&#039;ve been flipping through the issues, and they&#039;re amazing.  It&#039;s obviously a feminist magazine, but it isn&#039;t overly political (just the right balance of fluff pieces about how much Paris Hilton deserves to be punched in the face with pieces that critically examine our government/society), and always has interesting interviews and reviews and art pieces and--&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>I&#039;ll make this brief...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/384</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;because I&#039;m in my grandma&#039;s room and she wants to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this story is actually kinda about my grandma, so it works out really well. How? I don&#039;t know. But listen to what I have to say...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 2 or 3 years, my grandma has bought me a subscription to Newsweek (which I read half of and skip over anything political because it&#039;s the SAME every week. Really, they should just put out one issue a year [I guess they&#039;d have to start calling it Newsyear] and have one article that succinctly says, &quot;It&#039;s all been pretty bad.&quot;). Anyways, just recently i got a hold of a few Rolling Stone magazines. The day after getting my hands on these babies I told ol&#039; Grama to cancel Newsweek and get me some Rolling Stone. I figure at this point in my life (I&#039;m 21[but my birthday&#039;s on Nov. 9th {gifts can be left in Pomona box #244, thanks.}]) I want to stop pretending I care more than I do about politics and most world issues.&lt;/p&gt;
