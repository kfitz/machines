 <title>Fanfiction:  13 Stories Do Not Exist</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/430</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So.&lt;br /&gt;
The cover of Free Culture is a real trip.  However, I explained this to my roomate and showed her the cover, and she informed me that I was &quot;trippING&quot;.  She is smarter than me so I guess that sort of stuff doesn&#039;t really appeal to her.  If you look at it at a certain angle the (c) disappears.  And I, for one, think that is real neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t believe the inventor of FM radio killed himself after a devestating patent war.  Not only did he commit suicide, but he fulfilled the fatal act by jumping out of the 13TH STORY OF A BUILDING.  The weird thing about this is that American buildings HAVE NO 13TH STORY.  WE LEAVE THEM OUT and instead construct a 12th and a 14th Floor, easily and completely ommitting the unfortunate 13th.  So did Armstrong jump from the 14th floor and therefore the 13th story?  Do we think he knew this fact when he jumped?  That is why I hypothesize that he WAS PUSHED.  THAT&#039;S RIGHT, I am like Encyclopedia Brown.  Anyhow, I just thought that gruesome nugget on death was a real hooker for the first few chapters.  A real hooker.&lt;/p&gt;
