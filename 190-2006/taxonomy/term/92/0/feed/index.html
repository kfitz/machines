 <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like every subject I could tackle right now has already been addressed.  Seeing as there have been about 10 blog posts in the last hour, I assume everyone else have the same anxiety I do and just really want to say something before their topic is run down by the merciless Blog Truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, the whole idea of the &quot;auteur&quot; as the director was to circumvene the fact that a film is created by way more than one person.  According to les frenchs, the director of the film has the most flexible power over all areas of production, from cinematography to lighting to costumes.  I agree with this, although it&#039;s a shame when other people don&#039;t get the credit they deserve.  However, if you&#039;ve gotta put a name on something, it might as well be the director.  A &quot;good&quot; auteur, therefore, was a director who could consistantly implement the most of his personality or style into the final product, even working through several other people.  Examples of such auteurs would be Hitchcock and (gag) Jean-Luc Godard, who systematically used the same cinematic language within their films.  If the director was &quot;killed&quot; in the many hands of production, s/he is certainly resurrected if successful as an auteur.&lt;/p&gt;
