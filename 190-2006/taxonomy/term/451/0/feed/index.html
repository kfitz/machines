 <title>work spaces</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/418</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Manovich article starts out talking about the work space which Razorfish embodies. He says of the office, &quot;The design of the space functions as a metaphor for computer culture&#039;s themes; interactivity, lack of hierarchy, modularity.&quot; This made me think as I have always had an interest in design, especially that of a-typical work spaces.    Weird thing to have an interest in, I know, but I swear it is true.  It has caught my eye ever since I walked into the office of a financial planner which had been designed by one of the guys on Queer Eye for the Strait Guy.  This office was somewhat similar to the described Razorfish office.  The owner of this company explained to me that the space was about having intimacy in the work place when computers are driving us to a point of isolation.  Again in this office there was no semblance of a hierarchy and no closed doors.  Everything that was happening in this office was in plain view to all who entered the space.  Again this summer at my work I encountered another interesting design.  Again it was relitivly open, but did have offices along the walls.  Each of these offices however had glass walls so you could see everything going on within them.  At first I felt like I would never have a moment of privacy in the office.  This was true, other than the bathroom of course (which I might add was co-ed, something I never fully embraced).  Again it the space was about television.  The office was designed to give of a young hip, modern feel and leave space for communication to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
