 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a thought while watching O Brother Where Art Thou?. It was about executions. I don&#039;t usually daydream about such horrific things, but sometimes I do. Anyways, O Brother takes place in a time when many executions were public. Not only were official executions public much of the time, there were often lynch mobs and other sorts of groups who would execute people in public. I wonder, if there was a public execution these days, on the 5Cs for example,  if anyone would watch it. Would it matter who the person was? If the execution was perceived by most people as justified. I started thinking about all this because of Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;
