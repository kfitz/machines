 <title>i had a dream</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/678</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night. It was so great. I was in this really awesome dystopia where every place seemed like an airport. People were waiting in long lines everywhere to go through open, seemingly doors, despite the  dozens of identical doors, without lines, leading to the same rooms. Language was simplified, and no one said much of anything, anyway. I asked a woman behind a desk what was going on, where I was, what had happened, etc, and she said something like, &quot;we&#039;re not supposed to argue,&quot; turned around and walked away.&lt;br /&gt;
	I probably had this dream because I spent much of last night reading about, well, pretty much exactly what I dreamed about: enormously powerful governments (Chinese, American) that control every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;
