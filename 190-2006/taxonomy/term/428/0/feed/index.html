 <title>thoughts on video games of the oppressed</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/399</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I meant to post on this a few days ago...but here goes! When I first read the introductory paragraph for Frasca&#039;s article, &quot;Video Games of te Oppressed&quot;, I became intriged by the notion that video games have the potential to be a tool of social justice and tolerance. Though he mentions social justice, he doesn&#039;t explain it as a concep The word oppressed pretty much comes in the title, and in references to Boal&#039;s and Freire&#039;s works. Oppression, social justice, and tolerance become buzz words he throws around, and his analysis of how they can be addressed in video games seemed shallow to me as a result. While I liked how he talked abot Boal&#039;s theories about how theatre is a tool for  debate, not a goal or a solution in itself, and how it would be powerful to implement this philosophy in video games, his examples on what can be done did not live up to the grand ideas he was setting up. The examples of potential models of games, which he gives, seem to do little in addressing groups that have been institutionally marginalized. He doesn&#039;t really talk about these groups and their access to video games in general, which is salient to this issue. In an abstract way, one could argue that his proposed Pac-Man like game with bullies, invites dialogue about very real issues of how to deal with conflict. Likewise, his SIMS fantasy of an alcoholic mother character that you could merge with greenpeace activist, may also incite dialogue about issues of parenthood, substance abuse, and activism, and the plethora of different behaviors and personalities that could exist under these categories, which a user can use to modify the character. In a world where you&#039;re competing with Halo, and World of Warcraft, or whatever, would these games stand a chance?  Would they operate in a different space then mainstream games hold, like being mandatory in a classroom?&lt;/p&gt;
