 <title>History of Authorship Studies: Categories to Representatives</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/91</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow! I did not realize how much time and effort academics have put into studying this idea of authorship! Janet Staiger&#039;s article sums up seven approaches taken so far in these studies, and I find the last three particularly interesting (author as reading strategy, site of discourses, technique of the self.) They seem to explain the transition that happened from our first week&#039;s readings to our second week&#039;s readings, namely from the structuralist idea that the author is dead to the more post-structuralist idea that a plurality of voices must be recognized. They take it one step further, though, by making a distinction that I think we were getting at last time; we go from having no author (&quot;insistent unconscious writing by material discourses&quot; [46]) to having an author as a representative, a performative that is &quot;the repetition of [individual] statements&quot; (51). This is powerful in that it acknowledges voices without putting too much emphasis on them. This approach is helpful in addressing issues of agency for minorities, which we brought up with bell hooks and Marchessault.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Structure Question</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/54</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to ask a quick question that I think we were going to address last class, but never got around to.  Prof Fitzpatrick said that one of our readings from last week was by a structuralist, another by a poststructuralist, and the third somewhere in between.  I&#039;m not too familiar with the terms but I think structuralists see the world as a series of language systems, and poststructuralists stress the inadequacy of language.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Barthes then the structuralist, Foucault the poststructuralist, and Nesbit in between?  But then I have written that Foucault is &quot;interested in the ways power circulates through discourse&quot; - does this make him a structuralist?&lt;/p&gt;
