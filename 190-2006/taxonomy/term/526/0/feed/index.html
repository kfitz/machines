 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just got back from Tokyo, Japan where I was working on a future documentary on 50 years of videogames. The Playstation 3 launched there earlier there this week and me and my crew of two others were literally the first on the scene as hundreds of people had lined up for hours to get their hands on the new console. Well, we showed up at 4am and to say the least, it was intense. We were able to get a bunch of interviews with people standing on line (and the first guy to actually purchase one) and met some very interesting people. Some guys actually flew from the UK just to get one of the 90K that were sold on the 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
