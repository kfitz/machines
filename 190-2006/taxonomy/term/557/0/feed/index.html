 <title>Lasse Gjertsen videos clever title</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/487</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is mostly in response to the post about the videos of Lasse Gjertsen. I would just disagree with the first sentence that was said about &#039;Amateur.&#039; I&#039;m not sure it really brings up any questions of authorship. He is definitely the &#039;author&#039; of that music. (I&#039;m not sure though. when he starts playing the piano with the drums, that sounds so familiar. And too good, if you ask me. Someone should pay this guy to be doing something musically.)&lt;br /&gt;
What most rap and hip-hop producers and artists do is very similar to what Lasse does. They mix different sounds and beats with computers. Lasse is just recording the video with the audio and creating more of a performance out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
