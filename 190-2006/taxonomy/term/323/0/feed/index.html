 <title>Sophia Lamar vs. Fellow</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/286</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Article: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophia Lamar has beef with fellow gender benders Amanda Lepore and Jefree Star&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophia Lamar (born Enrique MuÃ±oz in 1955 in Castro&#039;s Cuba) has long been a fixture of New York Night Life, starting off with Michael Alig and the original Club Kids, and now a fixture at Misshapes. She also has a weekly outlet to air her thoughts in Johnny McGovern&#039;s Gay Pimpin&#039; podcast, where her popular segment &quot;What Sophia Lamar Hates&quot; ends each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophia charged MySpace &quot;e-celebrity&quot; Jeffree Star with ripping her off. Sophia Lamar is the muse of fashion design collective Ok Citizen&#039;s Society which years ago created a shirt with the phrase &quot;Sophia Lamar Will Kill You&quot;, and since then Sophia has adopted the phrase for her official website http://www.sophialamarwillkillyou.com. Well it seems Jeffree Star has started selling his own version of the shirt (seen here) with the phrase &quot;Jeffree Star Will Kill You&quot;. Sophia noted how her shirt is sold in boutiques all across the world, and his is sold on myspace. She says his use of the phrase is like her saying &quot;That&#039;s hot&quot; or &quot;You&#039;re Fired&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
