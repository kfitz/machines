 <title>My Blogs and Authorship</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/213</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I noticed that whenever I try to write my blog, or type i should say, my blog directly onto my computer, they end up being less of what I had intended and less of what Id hoped to present comes through. Everything, form information to my authorial voice is lost somewhere in translation. Maybe somewhere in my brain the supposed effiency that computers offer has made me less expressive when im using this particular medium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i tried somethign new, I wrote my blogs for this week on paper first, and voila. I was able to express myself more accurately My writing maynot be perfect, but i definetly think that there is a direct connection withthe return to a more organic form of hand writing that allows a less mediated me shine through.&lt;/p&gt;
