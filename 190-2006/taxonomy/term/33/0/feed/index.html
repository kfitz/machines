 <title>making films asian american</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/113</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week&#039;s bell hooks essay discussed the fine line between African American authors becoming defined by broad stereotypes of African American culture, and dismissing or distancing themselves from the identity completely.  &quot;Making Films Asian American&quot; touches on the same issue, asking whether Asian American filmmakers can push the boundaries of categorized &quot;Asian American low-budget cinema&quot; while resisting the crossover to mainstream (white) hollywood cinema.  Projansky and Ono quote Roddy Bogawa&#039;s essay, &quot;An(other) Reflection on Race?&quot;: &quot;For artists of color, expectations of what their work should investigate simultaneously dictate what the work should not explore...They construct Asian-American filmmaking as a uniform practice, ignoring the diverse complexities of each film and each filmmaker.  Their function is to stereotype, control, and marginalize&quot; (277).  Still, Asian American filmmakers who wholly resist definition as Asian Americans compromise an important part of their identity: &quot;[Peter X. Feng] notes that Asian and Asian American filmmakers tend to cross over to relatively big-budget Hollywood pictures only when they &quot;have either submerged their Asian identities to make films about white Americans or have added Asian &#039;flavor&#039; to Hollywood films&quot; (265).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>rap</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/76</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;bell hooks&#039; writing about rap &amp;amp; Leesoid&#039;s blog have me wanting to say a million things, but since I&#039;m presenting tonight &amp;amp; i&#039;ll probably talk more than enough then, I&#039;ll try to just mark a few main points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-hooks writes that &quot;much postmodernist critical inquiry has centered precisely on the issues of &#039;difference&#039; and &#039;otherness&#039;...in the absence of any sustained research into what artists of color and others outside the mainstream might be up to...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, where is all the research?  Does it even exist?  I&#039;ve spent the past hour looking for some supporting evidence of a statistic that I&#039;ve cited and heard many times in my life, but never gotten around to actually looking up: 80% of rap, r&amp;amp;b, and jazz production companies are owned by whites.  Has anyone else heard this, and can anyone find any solid source?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Postmodern Condiiton</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/73</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Something that interested me in the hooks essay (ahh, the sweet ease of not having to hit the shift button to type author&#039;s names) was her description of the postmodern &quot;condition&quot;.  hooks describes this condition as &quot;many other groups now shar[ing] with black folks a sense of deep alienation, despair, uncertainty, loss of grounding, even if it is not informed by shared circumstances.&quot;  Wow.  Though a somewhat common description of the plight of &quot;black folk&quot;, it&#039;s kind of intense to see hooks extend it to all of contemporary culture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets me thinking about postmodernism, its emergence in critical theory, and its roots outside of academia.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Who is she actually writing this for??</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/68</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;hooks&#039; reading really made me question who her intended readers were.  While she makes it quite clear that she wants black women (and men) to read and understand the oppression society&#039;s racial constructions, it is evident throughout her essay that she also wants the white, intellectual male population to read and interpret her work. In one part of her essay she states that she worried about her arguments lacking conviction.  Well, it is possible that if these arguments were more common or better known (especially among the dominant white male intellectuals), they would have the conviction necessary to make an impact. While reading her essay, it was clear to me that she knew that many potential readers were going to be these white intellectual males she is discussing. She clearly knows this, as she says she is cautious when discussing such topics.  However, the essay is also potentially aimed at blacks to raise their awareness of the societal situations they are placed in everyday. So clearly she can have more than one target audience, but I find myself torn as to discover which one she wanted to reach or influence more...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>bell hooks is a sweet name</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/67</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So bell hooks is here talking about post-modernism and the &quot;black folks&quot; place within it. It would seem that in this post-modern era, where we can have dead authors and readers that write the texts they just read, having specific racial identities that are also authors may have little place amoung the dead. There are two sides to this. Going back to Barthes, we can see that eliminating the identity of the &quot;black&quot; author, makes the work stand on its own without the context of black history and ideals. However, this doesn&#039;t work at all when a black author decides to write a work dealing with black issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s all this nonsense?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/64</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In bell hooks&#039; essay Postmodern Blackness, she says she was at a social gathering where she was one of two black people. The other black person in attendace said to her, &quot;this stuff does not relate in any way to what&#039;s happening with black people.&quot; I would actually go further and say that postmodernism does not relate to any people. What is postmodernism, and why does it need to be talked about? I&#039;m not sure bell hooks even knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this essay, she discusses who discusses postmodernism. She never talks about the concept of postmodernism itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is postmodernism such an important thing to discuss, and why is it important that such discussions are inclusive of all types of people. What in God&#039;s name is &#039;postmodernist discourse.&#039; Why is postmodernism even a subject of conversation? Who are these people that discuss postmodernism over dinner? I don&#039;t know anyone who does this? do any of you?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Powers That Be...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/58</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have heard the phrase &quot;the powers that be&quot; used frequently in black literature and I always had a curiosity as to its origin. So in the spirit of sharing random and often useless information as is so common the mission of blogging, I decided to visit our friend Wikipedia. For those of you who don&#039;t know, it turns out that the phrase &quot;The powers that be,&quot; also known as TPTB, comes from the King James Version of the Bible. &quot;Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be are ordained of God&quot; (Romans 13:1). The current use of the phrase has evolved to refer to any group that holds power over a certain entity: politicians, television and film writers, CEOs, or in bell hooks&#039; article, the continual force of society in the alienation, and marginalization of African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
