 <title>Background info on The Man w/the Movie Camera if you&#039;re interested</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/215</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So while I was doing some thesis research I happened to stumbe across a book devoted entirely to the Man with the Movie Camera. In the mood to put off thesis for a bit, I read part of it, and was able to fill in some of some missing information I didn&#039;t get when we watched the film two weeks ago. In case any of you are interested, here are some facts that caught my eye: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertov veiws documentaries as the only valid form of film and &quot;The Man with the Movie Camera is a statemont of commitment to the documentary approach&quot;. Additionally, Vertov beleived himself to be a political filmmaker, and his objective, as he set forth in &quot;The Birth of the Cine-Eye&quot; was to &quot;further the battle for the communist decoding of the world&quot;. Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Vertov Part 2</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;10/10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to Vertovs film, I admre the way in which Vertov ccreated his piece with such a great snese of filmic freedom. The fact that he so freely was able to show a burth, something that we rarely see today (cultural differences aside) is amazing. I can&#039;t helpbut think that the novelty of film during that time and the need to explore its boundaries was the cause for such freedom--the need to learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I&#039;m impresses with how Vertov was able to use his film to portray his political ideas. While the film as a whole may nt neccessailry have a political  agenda, we as viewers certainly come away with a sense fo what he thought about his country during that time period--big brither was taken over. All you need to get a sense of this is the scene with the big (omniscient and omnipresent) camera (big brither) looking over the city.&lt;/p&gt;
