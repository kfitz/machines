 <title>border crossing sim</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/548</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a story on the news yesterday about an amusement park in Mexico near the border which offers simulated border crossings at night.  Tourists come from all over Mexico mainly, as the tour is given in Spanish, and embark on a 4 hour long simulation of would a illegal border crossing.  This includes such highlights as hiding out in river beds to avoid actors playing border patrol who are chasing after you.  People who don&#039;t keep up with the group even get &quot;arrested&quot; if they are caught.  In the end, the members of the group who make it are blindfolded and loaded into the back of pickup trucks and driven to a cliff that overlooks a large part of Mexico.  The simulation ends with an educational note about the dangers of border crossings and a pro Mexico stance.&lt;/p&gt;
