 <title>The House is taking over my life...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/185</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that the House has consumed me. I am way over halfway through it and cannot seem to put it down. Its kind of sick. I get so into it that my friends have been coming by my room and slamming my door shut or growling in through my window....and every single time i have a little panic attack. I think I am becoming Johnny Truant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#039;m particularly enthralled by the way this book encourages you to become an active reader by chosing how you read the book. My question is, does this then make each of us readers into a sort of author?? Obviously no one has the same experience when reading any particular material, but because this book offers so many different ways to be read, is this like a hyper version of most books?&lt;/p&gt;
