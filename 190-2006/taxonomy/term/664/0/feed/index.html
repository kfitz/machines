 <description>&lt;p&gt;the blog, as expected is always post heavy monday to wednesday. it&#039;s time to give the other days some lovin&#039;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working at the QRC, and stumbled on some comic books drawn by Erika Moen, who graduated from Pitzer last year. She designed her own major, &quot;Illustrated Storytelling&quot;. Her work is really fun and interesting. She took a bunch of different classes in art, English, creative writing, etc. With film and music, we&#039;ve talked about how collaborative it is, because you need all these different people with different skills. It&#039;s intersting that in comic books, you need the different skills, but you can do it all yourself (though there are many classes where it&#039;s more collaborative, or uses a team of people for production).&lt;/p&gt;
