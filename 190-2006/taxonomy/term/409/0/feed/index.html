 <description>&lt;p&gt;... and it&#039;s only november 2! i just had to sprint back from a social gathering, realizing it was nearly midnight and i had forgotten to post today. this should be an interesting month...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while my thoughts are still scattered and under-developed, i would like to look into my notes on two authors who have recently spoke here at the 5-cs. tonight i heard amy tan, and a few days ago i heard david sedaris - and each time, i was hit with little lightbulbs of inspiration when i realized i was witnessing my notions of authorship shift. reading an author&#039;s work is drastically changed once you hear (and see) said author live, even more so when you hear them read their own work in their voice.&lt;/p&gt;
