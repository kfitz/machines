 <title>Colonial House</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/511</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This was sparked by ghostwriter&#039;s post, Yr colonial fantasty (or something like that). I have all these half-finished posts saved on my desktop that I need to catch up on posting. here is one of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember the show Colonial House on PBS? I was super addicted to it for awhile. It&#039;s part of this series of reality shows that, yes, even PBS had (including 1940&#039;s house, the 1900 house, frontier house, manor house, texas ranch house, etc.). The crux of these shows are to explore how modern day individuals would cope and react to trying to re-enact certain moments in history. Colonial House (which is the only one I&#039;ve watched so far), shows a group of diverse individuals who try to recreate the colonial life of the year 1628. It includes a diverse cast, in terms of class, family situation, race and even sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Historical Context &amp; an Apologia for Vesna</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/385</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate understanding the context and history of the perceptual shifts that result from New Media and Internet technology. In one of my other classes, we have been studying the perceptual changes in people that accompanied the Industrial Age, epitomized in the railroad. That is when society&#039;s need for speed really took off. That is when time and space began to dramatically shrink. There wasn&#039;t yet a global village, but the idea of a nation began. For example, it was because of the Industrial Age that many scattered parts of Germany coalesced into a nation in the late 1800s. Technology back then brought on nationalism, and now with the Internet, technology has brought on transnationalism and a more worldwide sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A great event this Thursday: about Music, History, Politics, Diaspora, and Vietnam!</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Music of the Republic of Vietnam - Before and After the Diaspora&lt;br /&gt;
- Lecture by Jason Gibbs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, November 2 at 4:15 - 5:30 p.m. (followed by reception)&lt;br /&gt;
Hahn 108 (420 Harvard Ave.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the end of World War II, civil conflict has divided Vietnamese society and, for a period, Vietnam itself. During the Cold War, an actual boundary at the 17th parallel blocked contact between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the North and the American-supported Republic of Vietnam in the South. While the communist North used centralized control to insure that its music served the interests of socialism and total mobilization for war, the South developed an eclectic, market driven popular music culture. Following the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, the victorious communists banned and worked to confiscate nearly all cultural products of the South. The music of the Republic of Vietnam, however, has survived and developed among the waves of refugees and immigrants from Vietnam to the U.S. and other countries in the West. Despite government suppression, it has also continuously thrived in Vietnam&#039;s black markets. Over the past decade the cultural division between Vietnam and diasporic Vietnamese moderated considerably with singers and songwriters from both sides regularly performing both in Vietnam and the West. This talk will discuss the music of the Republic of Vietnam and consider its genesis and continued popularity in Vietnam and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Memory Theatre</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/318</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was already interested in our discussion on external memory/externalized sources of knowledge. Then I went to my Digital Art class yesterday and exploring this was a huge part of our lecture. It&#039;s funny how classes can overlap like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we talked about that was most interesting to me was the &quot;memory theatre&quot;. Basically (and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m over-simplifying and leaving something out), the memory theatre was the brainchild of Giulio Camillo back in the sixteenth century. The concept is that, a person is standing on a stage, surrounded by seven different columns and rows, which are organized astrologically, based on the planets and their qualities and characteristics. These rows and columns would contain all the known knowledge in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
