 <title>Non-Narrative Performance</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/238</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I&#039;m still thinking about narration, and now I have some more questions/thoughts about non-narrative forms.  I was in Las Vegas this weekend and my friends and I went to see Le Reve (the dream), an acrobatic, Cirque du Soleil type show.  The show didn&#039;t make any linear, narrative-type sense as I suppose the audience had been warned about in the title...  But I wonder, what effect does providing that kind of a background as a prelude offer to a production?  Or a better question I guess, what kind of license does an author get when advising that a creation is dream-based (or simply non-narrative based)?  Would most audiences be less willing to drop their attachment to narrative theatre or spectacula without prior explicit warning of the possiblity?  It&#039;s kind of interesting that we bring out previous conceptions of where we expect narrative to appear and where we don&#039;t to the table when consuming media...&lt;/p&gt;
