 <title>Accessible Postmodernism? An oxymoron?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/62</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Postmodernist discourses are often exclusionary,&#039; begins Bell Hooks in &quot;Postmodern Blackness.&quot; Throughout her article on the relationship between postmodernism and the black experience, Hooks suggests that this discourse and its ramifications for experience and identity ought to be extended to marginalized groups (namely &quot;black folks&quot; and feminists). However, she also argues that black women authors should be &quot;approached with intellectual seriousness.&quot; She simultaneously advocates for the intellectualization (is that a word?) of marginalized groups, and also the importance of making discourses accessible. I think we must have different definitions of accessible, because I don&#039;t think the majority of these marginalized groups would understand much less relate to much of the article. She dismisses &quot;specialized audience&quot; to which critical voice is directed, yet she is most definitely addressing this exact audience. Finally, towards the end, she truly advocates discissing postmodern ideas with &quot;underclass non-academic black folks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
