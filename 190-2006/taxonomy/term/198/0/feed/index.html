 <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t read this book at night.  Granted I am a bit of a wuss when it comes to anything remotely frightening.  I.E. I can&#039;t even handle watching the previews for The Grudge 2.  But-- You would think I could read this book at night, honestly.  Last night I tried really tried and I was so fully imagining the pressence in my dark room that I had to put the thing down.  But, I mean it isn&#039;t even really scary, creepy yes, psychologically challenging, but not really that scary hmmm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just think it is interested that I feel like I have been so influenced by the tone of the book as set by &quot;Johnny&quot;.  If it weren&#039;t for being told at the beginning of the book that I was going to be in for a mind tripping ride I don&#039;t think I would find the tone so daunting.  Really the naritive of the Navison Story isn&#039;t that unsettling.  A little strange, but if I didn&#039;t have Johnny intermitidly telling me how life altering it was I don&#039;t think I would be frightened.  It is amazing how this writing strategy works to completely alter the way I read both sets of narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
