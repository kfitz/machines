 <title>Clearly, I&#039;m obsessed with Post Secret</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/354</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after that (quite overly-long) entry on Post Secret, I&#039;ve realized my mind is very much still churning. I&#039;ve now got on to thinking about authorship and Post Secret. In looking at authorship in relationship to Post Secret we are not only confronted by the interplay between authorship and intention but also by the fact that what we see in the Post Secret website and in the books has been touched by someone other than the secret-holders. Frank Warren is allowed to edit the submissions and print and post some submissions while leaving out others. On the books, he is listed as the sole author. (Of course, what other author could he possibly list since the whole point is that the postcards are sent anonymously???). Still, it is these anonymous authors&#039; words that I read in the books and on the website and I feel they are so much more the authors of Post Secret than Frank Warren. Really though, the only way I can justify to myself that he is credited as the author is by appointing him as the author of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
