 <title>Commonality between author and reader</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/59</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Marchessault talks about women writers having a lack of authority and needing a communication of experiences particular to women&#039;s lives. I wonder about this idea that the reader must have some commonality with what is being read, in order that this unification can occur. How much experience must be similar to get the &quot;universal&quot; redefined? Do we only get something out of writing that we have a basis of similarity with? It seems that a good author can reach an audience without that?  I believe I have been changed by a book when it was completely foreign to me, without any experience on my part to draw me in.&lt;/p&gt;
