 <title>more on  playstation</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/466</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to do more research into the launch of Playstation 3. Conclusion, it is a little insane.  My boyfriend is included in this madness though, so I suppose I can&#039;t judge too harshly. He has been outside of Target since last night, the Playstation doesn&#039;t come out until Fri morning. (don&#039;t get me started on what I think about that)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is the plan.  Go to Target today, line up, buy a Playstation then sell it on E-bay to pay for my grad school.  Anyone want to join? But then I heard that people did this with the Xbox 360 and there wasn&#039;t enough of a demand for them to really inflate the prices on e-bay.  I guess they had struggled to get their release date out before the Playstation and Nintendo and because of this there was some glitches.  Seems like there is going to be major high-powered, high-tech game system saturation to me.&lt;/p&gt;
