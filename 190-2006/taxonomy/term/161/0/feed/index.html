 <title>response to Madame Butterflizzle</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/154</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think that just because the audience isn&#039;t provided with an actual theatre experience they aren&#039;t being provided with an alternate and valuable experience.  Yes there is something to be said about seeing Madame Butterfly in the Met, but there is also something to be said about seeing Madame Butterfly broadcast over the streets of New York.  If the purpose of this is to make the Theatre more accessible to the general public I don&#039;t see anything wrong with this form of broadcasting.  First there are many people who cannot afford to have an actual theatre experience, bringing the met performances to them may be the only way they are able to have view these shows.&lt;/p&gt;
