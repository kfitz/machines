 <title>Isn&#039;t there anything else to post about except house of leaves?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/188</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;No, there is nothing else to write about, so don&#039;t bother reading, because its already been said.  Caveat out of the way, here goes.  House of leaves is consuming. I just want to read it all day, but I&#039;m constantly frustrated by it. I always feel like i&#039;m missing some important meaning or secret code. Like I&#039;m not understanding the full text because I don&#039;t know what references to pay attention to, or what they mean, or if they are even real. I guess that&#039;s the point, that no meaning drawn from the text has any more value than another and validity and significance are subjective and mutable. But that feels like a bunch of postmodernist bullshit - I want to understand it, all of it. I understand the compulsion to research, mercilessly dissect for codes, search message boards - that must be why there are so many. I&quot;m tempted to peek at them, but I know they&#039;ll just suck me in deeper and then I&#039;ll be a house of leaves freak and I should really go to bed... but I&#039;ll probably go back to the book.&lt;/p&gt;
