 <title>Oh my god I haven&#039;t posted in so long</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/559</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I hadn&#039;t been on LJ since the 19th either. Basically since then I&#039;ve been busting my balls to get all my finals stuff done. Flash project, Physics labgroup that totally flaked out on me and left me with all the work, papers, midterms...oh yeah and that chapter of our thesis, which I&#039;m still not close enough to done with for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don&#039;t have much to say. My brain is fried and I just desperately need to post so that I won&#039;t force the big KF to give me a lower grade then I know she wants to *most charming smile*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my chapter....coming along. Like halfway there...ish.&lt;br /&gt;
The problem is that i haven&#039;t had the time to do as much of my research this semester as I&#039;d wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
