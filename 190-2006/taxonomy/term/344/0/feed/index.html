 <title>One for the ego...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/313</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, the small little example of &quot;Eliza&quot; and the quite limited interactions we could develop with her made me think about how I am so glad that the chats I have are with fellow human beings. Also, as I was walking home, I was thinking about chat sessions and if it&#039;s possible to find some merit in it as a literary form.   Based on my own personal experiences, I know this sounds kind of like an ego-trip, but I admit that I have saved past chat sessions which I believe deserved to be recorded and stored. Whether I was able to reach some type of higher thought with the person I chatted with, or whether we were able to develop a witty conversation that could even have a narrative structure, I thought it was imperative that I did save these enlightening chat sessions. As I was walking back to my room I thought of it might be of real interest to examine chat sessions in the light of the discussion we have been having in class regarding authroship. Can a chat session be looked at as a literary form that deserves a place in this debate of authorship? What does the ability to save a chat session influence its authenticity as a literary document?&lt;/p&gt;
