 <title>Projected &quot;blog&quot; identity vs. projected &quot;real&quot; identity</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/360</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the way people build blog identities doesn&#039;t shed light on the way we build our real-life identities that we project to others. I know some blogs seeminly bear no relation to their authors -- people create fake blogs all the time - but I think that the authors of even these blogs come through in some way in the online &quot;person&quot; they have created so I will not distinguish between fake blogs and blogs that are just a version of the real person they are created by. That said, when a blog-identity is developed, the author can almost fully hide certain aspects of themselves. They can manipulate how others see them to a much greater degree than we can in our real lives. In this manner, it seems the idea that we cultivate others&#039; perceptions of our identities (and we do it in line with how we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; others to see us) is similar in both real life and on the internet. The difference is that it is more extreme on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
