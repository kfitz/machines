 <description>&lt;p&gt;Our age was long ago dubbed the information age, but yet we constantly hear about rampant ignorance and complete lack of common sense. I have only recently begun considering (i.e. should have started a lond time ago), the idea that the information we are recieving constantly and in overwhelming amounts is not at all informative. I&quot;m not talking disinformation or lies or conspiracy theory here. I&#039;m talking self-help books and magazines. Yeah, we all laugh them off and at the same time sneak into a corner of Barnes and Noble to read them - to tell us how to eat, how to dress, how to entertain, how to understand and change our faults, how to do everything we should know how to do ourselves. Somehow these books and issues have convinced us (at least me) that we don&#039;t know how to do simple human activities like feed ourselves or put on clothes or make friends or write coherently. These are basic human functions and yet we are convinced we must be doing them wrong and need help finding the way.&lt;/p&gt;
