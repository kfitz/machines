 <title>response to the polling Q</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/114</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the polling question.  Are all films art?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all goes back to that question that many of us have faced before.  What is art?  If a two year old doodles on a piece of paper to show their mother is that art?  Or should art only be considered art as decided by the critical eye.&lt;br /&gt;
I think that this question is ambiguous in the same way that the survey we took in class last week was.  Everyone is going to provide their own answer because everyone is going to relate to what they consider art in a different manner.  It is a subjective question and the answer for me is loaded with personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
