 <title>Politics &amp; the Internet</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/415</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, instead of finding a television to watch breaking election news, I stayed at my computer, checking back in to credible news sites to find out any updates.  This made me think back to the ways I used to find out breaking election news-- even sophomore year, during the Presidential election, I remember being with a ridiculous amount of people huddled around a dorm room television.  And I could&#039;ve done this again I guess, if I&#039;d wanted, but I think that something has changed in the way America and I do politics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages to using the internet instead of the television to find out breaking election news.  For one thing, I didn&#039;t have to sit through some news anchor&#039;s meaningless drivel as he tried to fill up time between election projections.  I was also able to immediately access information regarding the exact races I was interested in finding out about, without having to sit through in-depth profiles of Nebraska&#039;s House candidates.  Most importantly, at least for me, I was able to multi-task throughout the whole night, keeping a handle on both my school work and the future of America!  Did anyone else find that this year they shifted to the internet from watching television for election coverage?&lt;/p&gt;
