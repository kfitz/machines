 <title>Duck Amuck</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/323</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone liked the presentation our group gave for Hamlet on the Holodeck. I had a lot of fun--and not just with the wine. I thought it was cool that we could integrate so much real-life stuff into the theoretical dissections of literary development. I am thinking, in particular, of &quot;Duck Amuck&quot;--the Daffy Duck cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cartoon was fun to watch because I felt like I was a kid again. That&#039;s involuntary, associative memory for you. In another class, I just had to read all about Proust&#039;s feelings on the unique power of involuntary memory. For him, it was a cookie, not a cartoon, that brought back childhood memories that he couldn&#039;t make himself remember. At any rate, there is power in the object that can do that: awaken emotions and visceral memories that the intellect and just words can&#039;t reach.&lt;/p&gt;
