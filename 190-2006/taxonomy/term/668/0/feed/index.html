 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting in work at rains today, i was reading up for my thesis. This includes a bunch of stuff about the South and whiteness and such, and i started to reflect. I reflected all the way back to the fourth grade.&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t remember much from the fourth grade, but I have distinct memories of music class. For example, I was downright sick with a recorder in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;
Anyways, we sung a lot of songs that I didn&#039;t really understand at the time, such as a lot of sailor songs and things like that that had terms in them i&#039;d never heard before. One song that I have SPECIFIC memories of singing, and having NO IDEA what it was about was &quot;Dixie.&quot; Now, I&#039;m not sure what other people think of that, but I find it odd that Fourth graders are being made to sing a song that is a rallying cry for (mostly racist) white southerners.
