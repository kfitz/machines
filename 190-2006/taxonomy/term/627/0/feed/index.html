 <title>Our last registration</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/539</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In just a few weeks, we&#039;ll be through with fall semester... which also means we&#039;ll be second-semester seniors.  Am I the only person who feels like this happened really, really quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, registration this morning was the easiest it&#039;s ever been, but in some ways I feel like I wasted it.  I didn&#039;t sign up for any of those coveted classes, the ones that only seniors get into...  I mean, Senior Thesis was a given, so there wasn&#039;t any surprise that I got into THAT one, and aside from that, I&#039;m taking two Art History classes to complete my minor.  I also registered for a couple electives which I may or may not end up dropping... plus some P.E. classes in hopes that I&#039;ll suddenly get inspired to work out on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
