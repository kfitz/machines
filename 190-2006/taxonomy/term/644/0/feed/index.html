 <description>&lt;p&gt;With much resistance at first, I have now succumbled fully to the ipod revolution. I was really put off my the advertisements at first. in the Bay Area, at some BART (Subway-like public transportation) stations, the platforms would be covered with IPOD ads. You couldn&#039;t go anywhere without seeing those  Even though there are definite faults (it&#039;s expensive, the battery-life is ridiculously not what they advertise, etc.), I love my ipod. it&#039;s just crazy to have so much of my music available at once. I used to carry my discman everywhere with me, and would have a cd case that could hold 10 CDs. I&#039;d carefully pick my selections before going out, etc. so having it all easibly accessible in this tiny little thing was awesome. I even have ipod accessories, such as portable speakers. my ipod allegiance is pretty pricey though for me it&#039;s been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it filesharing, the more uncertain I become about its effects on the music industry.  Lessig writes that roughly 28% of Americans older than 12 had downloaded music.  I doubt a significant number of people over 55 download anything, which bumps the number of actual to potential users up to maybe 1/2.  So who are the people who are downloading music, and who isn&#039;t?  Everyone I know who is extremely into music downloads almost everything, and buys only the best of the best albums, having listened to a much broader selection.  If everyone did this, it could have a natural selection-esque effect on the industry and force artists to constantly come up with innovative music to meet the higher standards.&lt;/p&gt;
