 <title>SAVE A COMPUTER!  STOP THE DOWNLOADING!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/456</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t believe no one has written a post ripping into the RIAA yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean seriously.  This company is ridiculously greedy beyond belief.  I love how on page 71 Lessig proves their claims about their losses due to downloading as completely inflated and wrong.  I remember when the whole Napster lawsuit was going down, my lawyer friend Devon swore that downloading DID NOT hurt the artist, it only hurt the Big Man, and barely.  She said if you want to support artists you should download their music, but then attend their live performances, since they make a lot more off those.  It seems to me like the RIAA is just making money off other people&#039;s creativity.  I SAY BOO TO THE RIAA.&lt;/p&gt;
