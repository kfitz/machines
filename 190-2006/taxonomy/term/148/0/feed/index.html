 <title>media in education</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;as i was watching the &quot;what is art&quot; claymation piece from racinian&#039;s recent blog entry, i started thinking about how i miss making creative pieces about theoretical concepts. we did that in high school kind of a lot, but instead of stop-motion we did collages, videos, and some other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a literature class, we filmed a version of the show, &quot;the dating game,&quot; where the three possible choices to date were portia (from julius caesar), scout (to kill a mockingbird), and veruca salt (willy wonka and the chocolate factory). it was hilarious, but really analytical as well with the comments we threw in. my friends and i had so much fun writing the script and doing the acting. this class was AP and very well-taught, yet still fun.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Senior Seminar in Second Life</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/457</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve talked a bit about Second Life in class, how they have their own economy, news bureau, etc-- But it seems now that Second Life is also becoming involved in the world of education. I read an article this morning, and apparently over 60 schools and other educational organizations are beginning to use Second Life as a pedagogical tool. One of the major ways in which it&#039;s being utilized is with distance learning programs. The article uses a law school class from Harvard as an example. The class is offered both to students who are residents and distance learners. Class discussions, the professor&#039;s office hours, and even some class-related events are held in Second Life. In this case, Second Life can be a way to use 3-D navigable space (props to Manovich!) to create a new, virtual classroom setting. The article also mentioned how this space offers a lot of potential for international students to get involved. This space offers a way for students and professors to interact as a group, regardless of geographical location.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Simple, Practical Applications of Media to Education</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/143</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I met with my potential first reader for thesis, I was very impressed with his ideas for simple, yet practical applications of media to education. The ideas particularly resounded with me, because over the summer I had an internship at the University of California, San Diego, in their Professional Development Institute, which dealt with helping teachers better their techniques. We held a conference for the Los Angeles Unified School District (Local District 6) for ESL (English as a Second Language) kids, as well as a retreat for a new charter school that didn&#039;t know how to find resources. Both could use simple applications of media to help kids in their classroom and find administrative resources. Also, I read some e-newsletters on the use of technology and education with input from teachers on what worked for them, and my potential thesis reader&#039;s ideas were very much inline with the ideas teachers reported worked best. Here are some of his ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
