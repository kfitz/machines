 <title>why blogs make me sad....or AOL USER 23187425</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/131</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I totally posted a blog this afternoon and pressed submit and everything and lo and behold there is no post!! Similar stuff (though my fault), I posted some stuff last week but had forgotten to log in, so now I&#039;m guessing they will be lost in cyberspace forever! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways--my blog was about something that came up in my Digital Art class. One of the teachers (though not the official professor), Jason Brown talked about one of his projects. It all started with this guy who published the search inquiries of the users of an AOL search engine. You don&#039;t see the names of the users, instead users are assigned a number. So with this list you could see that at this time and day user 111 searched for this and later on he searched for that, etc. Here&#039;s a link with more info: http://www.lot49.com/2006/08/the_search_engine_diary_of_aol.shtml One user, over the course of May, searched over 8,000 entries. However, these entries were mostly bits of phrases that garnered no results, and instead created a strange poem or narrative. Jason Brown compiled the search inquiries in a book, which can be seen at this link http://superbunker.com/projects/i-feel-better/  Is this AOL user an author? What does it mean when something is published when it wasn&#039;t created with that intention? What does it mean when the medium itself isn&#039;t meant for authorship in how we normally think of it. In general I am fascinated by this, why this person typed so much so often, and what does it mean? Are they typing it for themselves or they are purposely transmitting their words into a global space?&lt;/p&gt;
