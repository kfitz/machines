 <title>Comics at the ATH</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/250</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 2nd, at the Athenaeum, there&#039;s going to be an &quot;Evening with the Author&quot; featuring Marjane Satrapi who is the amazing graphic novelist/comic book artist. Her work includes Persepolis I and II, where she talks about growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran, her adolescence abroad and then her return to Iran. It would be really interesting in light of our discussions on &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;. On one hand, her work challenges assumptions made about comic books. She addresses very serious, historically issues, yet also delves into her own personal, human experience. Her style is very unique, it what it is and what it expresses. Her drawings are pretty minimalist, almost childlike. The worlds she creates are solely in black and white, no grays, no shading or intermediate hues.&lt;/p&gt;
