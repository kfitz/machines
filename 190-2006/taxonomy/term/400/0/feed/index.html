 <title>New Thesis/Project focus.....</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/365</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My original project/thesis proposal had decidedly been to broad to be able to pursue in a way that allow for me to really explore effectively. So I researched the topic regarding identity and social networking systems and I concluded that the most pertinent SNS to people my age wre MysSpace and Facebook. And I realized that both were completely different in terms of who joined and how they portrayed themselves. And then Facebook opened up to the public in an attempt to become more inclusive. And Myspace has recenetly allowed for profiles to be blocked to the public. As has facebook. So myspace is becoming more exclusive and facebook more inclusive. Is this an attempt by both to attract both people who lobe being in the public eye and people who desire a greater level of privacy? How does the interface affect the overall usage? And this is how I came to find that what really really really interests me in terms of SNS is how the differences in the type of network design and interface affect the network identities that myspace and facebook users present and how these identities in turn affect the types of connections the users&#039; experience with each other. Do you guys think that this question is something that the average type of user asks themselves when they log on? Do you think they make a conscious effort to project a certain identity or do you think that the site design inherently affects the type of identity presented and thus the type and extent of connections made with other users?&lt;/p&gt;
