    <div class="content"><p>So, this class has me constantly thinking about authorship in many aspects of my life, and in particular my use of the internet recently. The reading for this week and last week have made me really look at the internet more critically and think about websites that I frequently visit.  One site that I enjoy that relates really well to authorship is   www.postsecret.com  .  It is a site where people send in anonymous postcards that have their inner-most secrets written on them. I think this is important in relation to authorship specifically because of the anonymous element the internet provides. Like blogging, which can be anonymous, the internet provides people a space to voice their opinions and feelings without having to do it in awkward social settings or in a place where they feel they could be scrutinized or openly judged. What I like about postsecret.com is that people can let out these secrets that they have bottled up inside and it allows them to have the emotional release of telling someone, without actually having to tell someone.  The site also does a lot to help people who have various issues from eating disorders to depression.  It is like an anonymous support group at times, where people can share and others are there for them and can respond to their postcards. People all over the world can connect with these people's secrets, realize that they are not the only ones with problems and realize that everyone has secrets they wish they could let out.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>During the presentation, the small little example of "Eliza" and the quite limited interactions we could develop with her made me think about how I am so glad that the chats I have are with fellow human beings. Also, as I was walking home, I was thinking about chat sessions and if it's possible to find some merit in it as a literary form.   Based on my own personal experiences, I know this sounds kind of like an ego-trip, but I admit that I have saved past chat sessions which I believe deserved to be recorded and stored. Whether I was able to reach some type of higher thought with the person I chatted with, or whether we were able to develop a witty conversation that could even have a narrative structure, I thought it was imperative that I did save these enlightening chat sessions. As I was walking back to my room I thought of it might be of real interest to examine chat sessions in the light of the discussion we have been having in class regarding authroship. Can a chat session be looked at as a literary form that deserves a place in this debate of authorship? What does the ability to save a chat session influence its authenticity as a literary document?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One distinct thing about House of Leaves is that it was distributed in parts over the Internet before being officially published. I think this is an interesting concept to explore. Our professor, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, did the same thing with her book, and, if I remember correctly, she said that the experience was much better than having someone edit the book later. This is because more people can view it, because of its accessibility and the smaller size of the presented chunks (as opposed to the whole book), leading to more and varied feedback.</p>
<p>I find this idea of rough draft Internet postings to be particularly interesting in questions of authorship. Although there is one central author, readers participate in the book's development, of course depending on how much the primary author takes their advice. I think also, that the author is more thoroughly conscious on what others will think of their writing. Does that detract from originality and encourage catering to others' desires? And, by the way, what if someone else steals your ideas? I'm not sure. It would be an interesting experiment to publish our theses in that way--</p>

   As some of you may or may not know, the band I'm in recently changed our name. Someone asked me at Symposium one night if I thought the new name made any difference. I immediately said it did. I felt freed as an author. The old name had come to symbolize a certain set of musical requirements, and the new one to me represents creative freedom. It symbolizes a willingness, almost a necessity, to step outside my personal boundaries of familiarity, and still somehow manages to encapsulate a more cohesive end product. My creative process has been restructured at every level by simply assigning a new name to the collective author of the final product. I'm not sure why this is, how it relates to being one author in a group of four - or seeing so many changes undergo the creative product from start to finish - or whether the old name had become an author-function representing a body of work I had outgrown...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Was going to include this in my last post, but I think it deserves a post on its own...</p>
<p>In thinking about new forms of classic media (such as House of Leaves (I would argue) and the Spore game I just blogged about, Brian Eno as quoted), I've been beginning to see the changes in authorship patterns.  Namely, I've noticed a trend in an author's willingness or openness to allow their work to be consumed and interpreted in ways that they can't predict.  In House of Leaves, it's up to the reader to choose which footnotes to read, what appendices to pay attention to, how much to invest, providing infinite opportunities to delve into the text.  In Spore, Will Wright has set up an environment that, instead of placing or installing a narrative or linear, predictable progression, gives literally all of the control to the consumer.</p>

Essentially, in the game, you begin with a spore that you control, whose necessities you take care of just like in The Sims...  and evolve and as you evolve, you get to choose what changes are made to your creature: will you put a spike on their forehead so predators don't bite their heads off?  how about adding more tails to help them keep their balance?  And so the game goes, and you continue to evolve, until you become a creature that begins to build a tribe, then a civilization, then a globalized world...  and then you start trying to take over the rest of the universe.</p>

<p>...Bueller? .....Bueller?  Anyone?</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about cookbooks, the recipes in them, and what makes them unique or different from predecessors, and what makes traditional recipes worth revising.  Obviously there are a lot of questions we can raise here: What constitutes enough change for a recipe to be made new?  Is the substitution of cream cheese for animal lard enough?  Adding an extra clove of garlic?  Setting the oven at a lower temperature and cooking a dish for 10 extra minutes?  Or is it the intent of a revision that makes it different, such as making a pesto using low fat parmesan (does this even exist?) for inclusion in a low-fat cookbook?  Who exactly authored pesto, anyway?  We all know pesto as an established foodthing, but what constitutes it, and what constitutes a revision?</p>

<p>Clearly, if what Marchessault says is true, the women who are authors are powerless... the very fact that their ideas are considered so diffuse and lacking in authority that their presence in the role of "author" destroys the validity of the author as an exalted persona. Nonetheless, this continuation of the denial of power to women as a whole ironically allows for the playing field between the genders to be evened somewhat, as men authors are also denied the power of an exalted author persona once the author is "killed".</p>
