 <title>Thesis Related, but hopefully interesting</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/573</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m currently taking Advanced Webprojects at Scripps, it&#039;s basically a Flash class, and our final project assignment was to create an extended animation or an interactive website. I decided to persue the later, using my thesis as my focus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://studentpages.scrippscollege.edu/~cmyers&quot;&gt;Here&#039;s the result, please poke around, not time consuming, it will be a nice study break, I promise! (click on &quot;ART 144&quot; then &quot;Final Animation)&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a work in progress and I intend to continue adding to it. I plan to use it in my thesis presentation, provided I get approval to persue an Honors thesis (fingers crossed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;d really like feedback. On the interface, on the content, whatever comes to mind. I&#039;d also love suggestions for other public artworks to include.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Revised Revised Thesis Proposal</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/263</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So after discussing my first revised thesis proposal with my girlfriend I came up with this second revision, and seeing as no one has commented on my first proposal post, I might as well put this up and hope you will give me some feedback on it. Come on guys, it&#039;s shorter than the first one!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Thesis Proposal</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I just wrote up my revised proposal and I would appreciate whatever input people are in the mood to give me. On the thesis topic itself, on the proposal, suggestions for sources or interesting directions I could go. I was a little unsure of what the format for the proposal should be, are there things I should include that I didn&#039;t, things I did include and shouldn&#039;t? You know, the basic peer review. KF, your input would also be quite welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, my thesis proposal:&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Since thesis seems to be vouge at the moment...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/171</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Questions to the reader at the bottom, please read more and give me feedback, if you have the time)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in our opening class I&#039;m planning to write my thesis on and in the attempt to re-theorize public art. As I have also mentioned, Banksy was part of my inspiration to do this. Spring before last, when he put his paintings up in NYC museums I was grabbed by his fanciful problematization of the museum system (and his concurrent anti-war messages). I decided to write my final paper for Media Theory on the political efficacy of public art, with a particular emphasis on what I dubbed &quot;ephemeral public art&quot; (i.e. Banksy, Guerilla Girls, ACT Up, Think Again, etc.) I very quickly discovered that while there was no end to critical debate on the relative virtues of Richard Serra&#039;s &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; and the questions that it brought to light (primarily what should public art be? does it have to be aesthetically accessible to everyone? should it be art for art&#039;s sake or something more? and so forth), there was very little, if any, critical attention given to the very forms of public art that I was most interested in. With a limited time line and a 20 page limit, I did the best I could to discuss ephemeral public art with the resources available; however, it left me wholly unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
