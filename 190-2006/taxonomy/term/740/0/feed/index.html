 <title>better late than never......?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/622</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Is that saying about things are better late than never really true? ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I feel pretty stupid and kinda embarrassed.  I talked a big game and tried to catch up all during November by blogging everyday. But then I forgot (on day four) and then shortened my commitment to during the weekdays only -- and then I was like, I don&#039;t have time to blog on Wednesdays and then it just all went to hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize for leading you all on. That wasn&#039;t right of me, but I was really hoping I would actually write so many blogs so I wouldn&#039;t end up where I am right now. Which is now hovering between screwed and lostcause territory.&lt;/p&gt;
