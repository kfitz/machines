It's come in handy for quite a few papers of mine, and, appropriately, it's available online for free!  Personally, chapter five, "Multi-user Dungeons and Alternate Identities," is one of my favorites.  </p>
<p>Also, if any of you love South Park as much as I do (and I love it a whole lot) then you should DEFINITLY watch this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=TBBbM2iFQ1g">episode</a>, it's pretty relevant to our reading for this week.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, in section four of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray says:</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, the Internet is beginning to function as an alternate broadcasting system-- as television channels and the World Wide Web come closer together, the telephone, computer, and cable industries are racing to deliver the new digital content to the end user faster and in greater quantities"(253).</p>
<p>I think that we're definitely seeing the ways in which the Internet is influencing TV. I find that nearly all of my TV watching is on my computer and is facilitated by the internet, even when I'm at home for holidays and have more access to actual TV. While most TV on the internet is provided by users (such as the person who puts the latest episodes of <em>America's Next Top Model</em> on YouTube. Thank you, whoever you are--), the TV broadcasting companies are getting in on the TV on the internet train too. Aside from iTunes, which has deals with several networks to sell episodes in the iTunes Music Store, some networks have their shows available for free on their websites. Two examples would be abc.com and the-n.com. ABC uses the tagline "Watch tonight on TV, watch tomorrow online". The-N has a section of their website called "The Click" where viewers can watch full episodes of shows, as well as previews for upcoming shows, and "webisodes"(which are kind of like the gutter space between episodes). Although there are still commercials, there are far less than on real TV and they tend to be only at the beginning of the episode. It will be interesting to see if more companies follow suit, and what effect the corporate presence (and copyright laws) will have on the more user dominated forms.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One of the things that really interested me in <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> was Murray's discussion of fan-fiction. Although fan-fiction exists in many forms, I think that now we're seeing more and more fan videos, and with the widespread use of YouTube, these are becoming more accessible to viewers. For example, from Harry Potter, to Batman, to Saved by the Bell, there's a plethora of gay slash fan videos on YouTube. </p>
<p>Fan-fiction tends to remain in its own bubble, generally either ignored or hated by the companies that produced the original texts (or in the case of Anne Rice, banned. What a bitch.). But in the past couple of years, there have been two incidents where fan videos have actually influenced film production. The first one is <em>X3: The Last Stand</em>. Towards the end of the film, during a confrontation with Shadowcat, Juggernaut says to her, "Don't you know who I am? I'm the Juggernaut bitch!". The line is taken from a fan video made by using footage from the early-mid-90s X-men cartoon with blaxploitation style voice-overs. The second example of course would be <em>Snakes on a Plane</em>, whose famous line comes from a fan video and wasn't origninally in the film. The popularity of the catchphrase online led to the studio to shoot more footage and add it into the film.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>On page 38 of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray states that, "to be alive in the twentieth century is to be aware of the alternative possible selves, of alternative possible worlds, and of the limitless intersecting stories of the actual world." </p>
<p>This quote reminded me of an improv show I went to on Sunday night. Three of the skits/games in particular stood out. The first one was a game in which there are two different two-person scenes going on, one being frozen while the other is in action. After awhile, the active scene stops and the frozen scene starts up again, using the last line from the formerly active scene (did that make sense?). Although that line remains the same in both scenes, both scenes were entirely different and used it in different ways. Game two was called "new choice" in which two people act out a scene, while the host periodically says "new choice", forcing them to go back and change the line they just said. This in effect changes the course of the scene, leaving the audience to follow the new direction while still wondering how the scene would have played out if the original line had been kept. The third game was one in which two people are acting out a scene until they are forced to freeze. While they're frozen, another person must step in and replace one of the actors in the scene, putting their body into the same position as the person they replaced. It was interesting to see how much the addition of this new person could change the scene. Although the actors were positioned in the same way, the meaning of that positioning totally shifted. Though <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em> discusses this kind of narrative in new media forms, it was interesting to me to see them played out in a theater format.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Just a quick note: in terms of intertextuality in new media, I think Lost presents one of the best and most thoroughly intriguing examples of a successful melding of medias.  Even within a single medium (television), Lost takes advantage of many of the developments Murray suggests are coming in future television-based media.  The show presents not only the storyline as it is taking place currently on the island, but also the back stories of different characters, switching between a few characters each episode, and changing character focuses every two to three.  I think this gives a far more complex (and ultimately more familar) notion of reality, and helps keep the show entertaining (so it isn't just a half hour of watching 25 people go "what the crap is going on??" every week).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Aldous Huxley's idea Murray uses as throughout the book (basically "will the stories brought to us by the new representational technologies 'mean anything' in hte same way that Shakespeare's plays mean something, or will they be 'told by an idiot'?") is insanely interesting, and one which I've been thinking about since reading Brave New World in a high school class.  </p>
<p>What I've been thinking about more lately, though, is the inherent assumptions within such a question: why exactly do Shakespeare's plays mean what they mean?  I think it's a strong tendency of American culture to privilege the past in such discourses, to assume the supremacy of what's come before in the face of what's new.  I know, I know, Shakespeare is Shakespeare and obviously his work is exemplary, but it isn't because he was working in literature.  It wasn't the medium that made Shakespeare as amazing and influential as he was, it was him, his work, and his ability to manipulate his medium.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Clearly you guys should make an effort to read as much of the book as possible, however, if you read nothing else, *please* read the fourth section all the way through. It's only 30 pages or so and it's pretty interesting. Alot of it has to do with her visions of future media and technology, so while you're reading the section be thinking about what she got right, what she got wrong, what might still happen and what probably won't, and why. Also try to think of your own examples of possible future media.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In Chapter 2 of <em>Hamlet on the Holodeck</em>, Murray discusses how new narrative formats are being developed along with new electronic technology. Beginning on page 51, she explores the narrative potential of video games. Although games have "more detailed visual environments and faster response time-- the narrative content of these games is thin, and is often imported from other media or supplied by sketchy and stereotypical characters" (Murray 51). While it's clear that we still have our share of games with thin narratives, or narratives based on stereotypical characters ("Grand Theft Auto San Andreas" comes to mind), I think that narratives in games have changed a lot since Murray wrote this in 1997.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>related to the point of having a plethora of realities possible in storytelling, Murray talks about fan cultures, and how they are able to create their own alternate possibilities and readings of their favorite characters, though mediums such as fan fiction and what not. however, with fan fiction (for film or TV at least), what I always found somewhat lacking or not as satisfying, is the fact that it's not the same medium. this reminded me of what we talked about with "understanding comics", about how meaningful it was that theory on a medium was conveyed in that very medium. it can be jarring when there is that disconnect.</p>
