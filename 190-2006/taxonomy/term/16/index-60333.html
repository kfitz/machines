    <div class="content"><p>After having batted around my original thesis idea for a while I've dedided to go in a new direction entirely and I'm still sort of molding this thing into a coherent idea (and one that is focused enough for a thesis to boot). Basically, as long as my final thesis still deals with the Dalai Lama and media, I think I will be happy so give me any ideas you may have. Here's what I've got so far:</p>
<p>I have recently become fascinated with how America has helped to create the world's image of the Dalai Lama as well as the image portrayed to Tibetans who are far from their homeland due to persecution by the Chinese. Many have fled to India and others to Europe and America. I wonder if perhaps even the Dalai Lama's own self image has changed due to the multitudes of documentaries, Hollywood films, and books that have him as the star. I feel that the media force of Hollywood must have influence over perceptions of the Dalai Lama but I am still learning about the films, books, magazines and other media sources that may have done this.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>...here are some commercials!</p>
<p>I know, I know, the idea of voluntarily watching commercials doesn't seem that appealing (there are, of course, a few exceptions) but I'm writing my thesis on the Dove Real Beauty advertising campaign and I'd like to get some input from the class.  </p>
<p>A bit of background:<br />
Dove's Real Beauty campaign was launched in late 2004, and first caught people's attention with the infamous average-women-in-their-skivvies <a href="http://www.jeffpidgeon.com/uploaded_images/real%20women-789598.jpg">photo</a>.  The campaign is "intended to serve as a starting point for societal change and act as a catalyst for widening the definition and discussion of beauty" (Dove.com)  As I'm sure you'll realize by looking at the photo, the campaign is fighting the stereotypical size two model found in most advertising.  The campaign has grown quite rapidly and now has a series of commercials: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=L_aDpmfAzxI">here</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=gUsKIApTewQ">here</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AOLfyUcYfpo">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to present evidence of how photographic truth has historically been a flawed and fictitious concept, how photographs have been manipulated for political purposes over time, and how this idea affects the present and will develop in the future.  I will further investigate these issues through research at the library and consultation with Professor Kathleen Howe and Professor Sheila Pinkel (specifically in relation to the history and theory of photography) and Professor Kathleen Fitzpatrick (focusing on digital imaging).  </p>
<p>STRUCTURE:</p>
<p>My thesis will consist of four chapters, each ranging from 10 to 20 pages in length, as shown in the outline below:</p>

I'm thinking about maybe just focusing on women. But perhaps as I dig deeper into the online communities I want to study, what I want to focus on will become clearer to me. Anyway, here's the proposal:</p>
<p>As postmodernism has influenced art and culture, it has also influenced the way we construct our identities. Under a postmodern model, conceptions of identity become more fluid, fractured, and wrought with a multiplicity of sources and meanings. Although postmodernism has been critiqued within the black community for its potential to deny the reality of lived experiences, I think that in this historical moment, postmodernism is crucial to expanding notions of blackness and black identity. The mainstream ideals of "authentic blackness" arise from social movements of the 1960s and often operate within the framework of a single-issue identity politics. Though these ideals were effective in achieving social, economic, and cultural gains for black people, they also "effectively hold the black community in stasis because they are not in sync with the fractures and fissures-- that frame the contemporary black experience" (Neal 6).</p>

<p>Have you ever read digitally/visually-based fiction or poetry and if so, what was your reaction?  For my thesis, I'm trying to present a collection of poetry as both a manuscript and a collection of text-based graphic pieces (a side note--does your thesis idea come out really differently every time you try to describe it to someone/write it down, too?) and I'm planning to use the 15-page supplement to describe the differences in production and effectiveness.  So how have you perceived 'text-based graphic pieces' when you've encountered them in the past?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One distinct thing about House of Leaves is that it was distributed in parts over the Internet before being officially published. I think this is an interesting concept to explore. Our professor, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, did the same thing with her book, and, if I remember correctly, she said that the experience was much better than having someone edit the book later. This is because more people can view it, because of its accessibility and the smaller size of the presented chunks (as opposed to the whole book), leading to more and varied feedback.</p>
<p>I find this idea of rough draft Internet postings to be particularly interesting in questions of authorship. Although there is one central author, readers participate in the book's development, of course depending on how much the primary author takes their advice. I think also, that the author is more thoroughly conscious on what others will think of their writing. Does that detract from originality and encourage catering to others' desires? And, by the way, what if someone else steals your ideas? I'm not sure. It would be an interesting experiment to publish our theses in that way--</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Key Question:  How have photographs been distorted for political purposes throughout history?</p>
<p>Readers: Prof. Howe and Prof. Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>"A photograph is often perceived to be an unmediated copy of the real world, a trace of reality skimmed off the very surface of life." -- Sturken and Cartwright's Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture, 2001</p>
<p>In my thesis, I would like to explore and examine the ways that photographs have been used to deceive the public, specifically for political purposes.  This idea grew out of my interest in the myth of photographic truth.  This myth has persisted since the time of the medium's invention in the nineteenth century.  Louis-Jacques-MandÃ© Daguerre and William Henry Fox Talbot, both credited with discovering photographic means of creating images, portrayed photography as a factual, automatic, and completely objective process, stressing that it enabled nature to "draw herself."  Daguerre and Talbot made the photograph sound like a scientific window onto the world when, in reality, it always had the potential to deceive.  Images that defy the myth of photographic truth date back to 1839 and can be found within the work of Daguerre himself.  Nonetheless, this myth continues to persist, perhaps now more than ever.  In the digital age, computer programs like Photoshop invite and even encourage editing, manipulation, and fabrication.  People today know how easy it is to alter images.  But somehow, in spite of this awareness, the public still buys into instances of photographic fakery.  Because of this, photographs have been a powerful political tool for more than a century.  Photographic images are often read as factual--especially when presented by the government or in newsprint--which makes photography the perfect medium for convincingly deceiving the public.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I'm currently trying to write my thesis proposal, but despite the fact that I have an outline and quotes, my brain is saying no. I was thinking, maybe if I blog about it, I can get the juices flowing again. </p>
<p>So basically, my thesis is about Black rockers, postmodern black identities, and virtual communities. Like we talked about when we discussed the bell hooks article, "Postmodern Blackness," postmodernism has often been overlooked by the black community, yet it holds some really powerful ideas that could help to create conceptions of black identity that are more fluid, open, relevant to contemporary black lives, and that take into account the reality of diversity in the black community. I've come across two terms that describe this: post-black and newblack. I haven't entirely figured what the difference between these two are, but newblackness is defined as a contemporary moment in blackness which "embodies a radical fluidity within the spheres of blackness that allow for powerful conceptualizations across black genders, sexualities, ethnicities... socioeconomic positions, and socially constructed performances of 'black' identity"(Neal 122).</p>
