 <title>Author Function spelled backwards is just nonsense</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/121</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I haven&#039;t read through everybody&#039;s stuff, and no one will probably read this before class in a couple minutes, but after having a conversation with one of tonight&#039;s presenters over dinner, I really believe that we don&#039;t need to distinguish who the author is in film. There are too many pieces, too many contributions. Instead we should use them all as author-functions, like Foucault talked about. The name Hitchcock, for example, conjures up a very distinctive style of look and feel for a movie. We use his name to talk about a bunch of particular movies and a type of movie in general. We use his name as an author-function.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Banksy matters.</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/89</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Living in LA is both a curse and a blessing. The smog, Hummers, lack of public transportation, etc... make me want to leave. But, living here means that I get to see loads of cultural productions that I wouldn&#039;t normally get to see at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city I live, frankfurt, has a nice graffiti scene; its not really up to par with berlin or hamburg, but I do get to see great pieces every time I drive under a bridge or when waking through the city. This summer, I visited my brother in London to help him move out of his flat. I had already known about Banksy (my brother bought me his book Wall and Piece last christmas) and I was really excited to be able to see his pieces where they are meant to be seen - in public space.&lt;/p&gt;
