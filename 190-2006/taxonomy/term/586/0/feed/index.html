 <title>Yay for Acrobat</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/510</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#039;m behind the times but I had no idea that Adobe Acrobat  will read files out loud for you. I was reading &quot;Free Culture&quot; tonight and I wanted to highlight certain passages so I was just looking around the program&#039;s toolbar to see if there was any way for me to do that. When I was looking under the &quot;View&quot; tab, I came across an option for &quot;Read Out Loud&quot;. So, of course, I had it read the page I was on. It came out in a computerized voice but it still sounded pretty good, I didn&#039;t have any trouble understanding it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is old news for you, then man, you&#039;ve been holding out on me. I had no idea that the program even had that option, I think it&#039;s really cool, and its making my reading a lot more fun now that I have my computerized friend reading along with me.&lt;/p&gt;
