 <title>YOUTUBE AND CIVIL LIBERTIES</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/482</link>

&lt;p&gt;This was posted on my friend&#039;s blog, with encouragement to re-post and share.  This UCLA student did not have his student ID at the library, so told UCPD he was leaving.  However, on his way out he was tasered mercilessly and continuously.  The event was captured on a cellphone camera and posted onto YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video isn&#039;t that great, but I think it&#039;s really interesting how cellphone cameras and YouTube are suddenly together fighting for social and civil liberties.  It calls to mind Rodney King, but rather than needing the mass media to distribute the video to the public, the public is able to do it quickly and easily without the help of television or news corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
