 <title>What if I changed my name?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/214</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, not entirely related to anything, but something interesting and hopefully preceeding more relevant material...&lt;br /&gt;
   As some of you may or may not know, the band I&#039;m in recently changed our name. Someone asked me at Symposium one night if I thought the new name made any difference. I immediately said it did. I felt freed as an author. The old name had come to symbolize a certain set of musical requirements, and the new one to me represents creative freedom. It symbolizes a willingness, almost a necessity, to step outside my personal boundaries of familiarity, and still somehow manages to encapsulate a more cohesive end product. My creative process has been restructured at every level by simply assigning a new name to the collective author of the final product. I&#039;m not sure why this is, how it relates to being one author in a group of four - or seeing so many changes undergo the creative product from start to finish - or whether the old name had become an author-function representing a body of work I had outgrown...&lt;/p&gt;
