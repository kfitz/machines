 <title>Thesis: A New Reader?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/175</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so as mentioned at the end of last entry, I don&#039;t think I will be able to take advantage of the inspirational professor I met with for two hours two weeks ago. This is because he deals more with simple, practical classroom usages of media, whereas I need to do a theoretical paper. I now have appointments with two other professors, who will hopefully be my readers. Profesora Donapetry, a Spanish teacher specializing in women&#039;s studies, might be very helpful because I am will be continuing the work I started over the summer, the creation of an online biography of my grandmother (a Mexican woman.) Profesora Donapetry would be able to help me in the content of the website, perhaps not so much the format. However, the content and its cultural implications might help shape the structure. For example, the website&#039;s audience might be older (closer in age to my grandmother.) And many viewers may be from Mexico, where digital technology is less available. Both older and technologically inexperienced people would need a very simple interface, perhaps one that starts with an introductory video, which is very attention-grabbing. I could then comment on the importance of the image in an increasingly globalized, international world, and I could expound on the differing experiences of the internet for people of various ages. Yes, the content does inform the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Thesis Thoughts: Meeting My Potential First Reader</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/142</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I met with my potential reader last Thursday. He is a new addition to the faculty and has a very rare hybrid position. He works for the Foreign Language Department, teaching one German class, but he is also responsible for integrating technology into classroom learning, particularly in language conversation classes. He is really an interesting guy, and I am almost positive that he should be my first reader. This is because my interests dovetail with his pretty well. Furthermore, he is the only faculty member I have found who deals with both media and education directly, which is why I am considering someone I hadn&#039;t even met yet to be my first reader.&lt;/p&gt;
