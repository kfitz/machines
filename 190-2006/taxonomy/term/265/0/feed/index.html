 <title>thesis proposal</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/253</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m trying to figure out how to make my thesis topic narrower, so I thought I&#039;d post my proposal to see if any has any suggestions, etc... I&#039;m thinking about maybe just focusing on women. But perhaps as I dig deeper into the online communities I want to study, what I want to focus on will become clearer to me. Anyway, here&#039;s the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As postmodernism has influenced art and culture, it has also influenced the way we construct our identities. Under a postmodern model, conceptions of identity become more fluid, fractured, and wrought with a multiplicity of sources and meanings. Although postmodernism has been critiqued within the black community for its potential to deny the reality of lived experiences, I think that in this historical moment, postmodernism is crucial to expanding notions of blackness and black identity. The mainstream ideals of &quot;authentic blackness&quot; arise from social movements of the 1960s and often operate within the framework of a single-issue identity politics. Though these ideals were effective in achieving social, economic, and cultural gains for black people, they also &quot;effectively hold the black community in stasis because they are not in sync with the fractures and fissures-- that frame the contemporary black experience&quot; (Neal 6).&lt;/p&gt;
