 <description>&lt;p&gt;Random, but I really like the second chapter in the book because of the way each authorship approach builds upon the previous one. It gives the reading a good rhythm. Not to mention that it was a lot easier to comprehend as a united whole. Anyhow...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked the secion about authorship as signature. I had never really thought about an auteur&#039;s films as being a signature, because in fact, it does make sense to think about the way the audience gets to know a director is consists mostly &quot;by repetition among various texts [that are] &#039;signed.&#039;&quot; The author&#039;s identity as far as we know him/her is thus a compilation and accumulation of various signs found within his/her texts. These signs form a message that we come to know as the author and his signature. Hmmmm. I like that-knowing that you immortalize &quot;yourself&quot; within your work. Rather than thinking of directors&#039; sets of films as separate entities (at least for the purpose of authorship as signature), thinking of them as  &quot;the product of a single intelligence&quot; (Staiger 44) helps for a more cohesive understanding of the author and behind the finished work. And as a result, also provides a way of bringing together individual films as a full set of films that share common ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
