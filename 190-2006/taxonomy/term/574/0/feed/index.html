 <title>Sony BMG merger</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/505</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At thanksgiving dinner I was struggling to make conversation with my dad&#039;s friend&#039;s son&#039;s wife, who is an antitrust lawyer.  Digging into the (maybe 3) facts I&#039;ve picked up from Students for Democratic Media, I said something along the lines of &quot;So--80 major media companies in the 80s consolidated into only 5 these days--bad news for the consumer, eh?&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy (the lawyer) responded that her main job is to facilitate mergers between major companies, and that she had worked on the 2004 Sony-BMG merger and had no opinion on its effect on the consumer.  This is where our conversation dwindled and I turned to my dad&#039;s godson&#039;s grandmother, who had a job with a clear purpose I could relate to (selling children candy.  That didn&#039;t exactly come out like I intended, the point is not that I am a sicko but that this grandmother cared about children, so she made a children&#039;s store. Unlike the lawyer who doesn&#039;t bother to form an opinion about a multi million dollar merger she&#039;s working on).&lt;/p&gt;
