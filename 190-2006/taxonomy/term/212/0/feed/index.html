 <title>Project Proposal block</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;After some research, I pretty much have a general idea of where I want to go with the final project paper. I&#039;m just not sure where to take it exactly.... This is what I have written down concretely so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;According to Wikipedia, a social network is understood to mean &quot;a social structure made of nodes which are generally individuals or organizations. It indicates the ways in which they are connected through various social familiarities ranging from casual acquaintance to close familial bonds.&quot;  With the introduction of internet based social networks, formally known as a social networking services, or SNS, users are allowed to build social networks through a social software and connect to other users based on whatever interests they desire. An internet based social network allows its users to create an identity that  may either be acurate or completely inaccurate depending on what they want to portray. Additionally, the overall accessibility to a social networking service is high, therefore allowing almost anyone to join, which may or may not pose a problem in terms of privacy. What this paper will attempt to do is explore and gain a better understanding of the impact that social networking services are having on identity management issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
