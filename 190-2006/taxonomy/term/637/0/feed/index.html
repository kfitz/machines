 <title>Random tangent of the day - DIVORCE!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/631</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this definitely isn&#039;t a very media studiesy post but it is cultural studies and that&#039;s part of what we do so I thought I&#039;d write it anyway. So I&#039;m sure this idea isn&#039;t actually as original as I thought it was when it came to me this morning but for some reason I&#039;ve been thinking theoretically about divorce lately (fun stuff!)and I&#039;ve come to a little conclusion I think. My current thoughts are that the increase in the divorce rate actually could have been predicted not only based on changing attitudes about &quot;till death do us part&quot;, a decrease in the stigma of being a divorcee, and a decrease in religious ties, but also from trends that started a long, long time ago...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Future of Food</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/545</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently in this weird documentary stage of my Netflix, why I have no idea. My recent documentary, The Future of Food worried me a bit.  Sure, I&#039;ve heard all the &#039;eat organic foods&#039; speeches and yeah, I shop at Trader Joe&#039;s sometimes, but I feel that the film should have scared me much more. I wanted an expose on all the crap the dining halls are feeding us.  All it really did was make me feel as though I was watching the film in a high school biology or ecology class or something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I guess I was expecting to see something like Fast Food Nation (which is now I film, that I haven&#039;t seen but I&#039;ve read the book). What I got was a lesson in genetics and how big companies, such as MONASTO - the makers of Round-up, make genetically altered seeds and then put patents on them so that farmers can&#039;t use their seeds.  While it is all a bit complicated, basically the big companies sue any farmers whose seeds have any genetic make-up related to their genetically altered seeds. Due to seeds easily spreading (through wind, animals, what have you), cross-polination occurs rapidly and basically all plants become altered with some part of these genetically-engineered seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
