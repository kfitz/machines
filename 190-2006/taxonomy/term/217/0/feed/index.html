 <title>thesis woes</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/520</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is just an emotional, crazy rant. This whole thesis process has, on one hand, been an intriguing process trying to find out what in the realm of media really interests me. However, not knowing what the topic I care about the most has made this entire semester, in terms of this project and thinking about thesis, like pulling teeth. Being overwhelmed by different things this semester, I decided to do my paper on something that I am interested in, though not necessarily for my thesis, just because I needed to start doing work on it. I&#039;m writing on Wikipedia.  Now I have 20 pages ahead of me to write, and i cannot make myself do it. I have no idea what I am doing. Is it because I&#039;m disorganized, or is it because I&#039;m not feeling the topic? But, I&#039;m not sure what topic I am feeling? Hopefully I will figure it all out soon. The last few weeks, I&#039;ve been trying to read articles and books, and that&#039;s been getting nowhere. Today, I began really looking at Wikipedia for myself and trying to make up my own conclusions, and that&#039;s made me feel better, even though I&#039;m not sure if i can sustain a 20 page paper on it, especially if it&#039;s a 20 page paper that I&#039;m not even sure will lead to a thesis. If i could know what I want to do it on I would, but I don&#039;t. I wish I could force it and just be happy about it but i can.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&quot;I&#039;m the Juggernaut, bitch!&quot; or Fan Videos in Action</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/293</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really interested me in &lt;em&gt;Hamlet on the Holodeck&lt;/em&gt; was Murray&#039;s discussion of fan-fiction. Although fan-fiction exists in many forms, I think that now we&#039;re seeing more and more fan videos, and with the widespread use of YouTube, these are becoming more accessible to viewers. For example, from Harry Potter, to Batman, to Saved by the Bell, there&#039;s a plethora of gay slash fan videos on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan-fiction tends to remain in its own bubble, generally either ignored or hated by the companies that produced the original texts (or in the case of Anne Rice, banned. What a bitch.). But in the past couple of years, there have been two incidents where fan videos have actually influenced film production. The first one is &lt;em&gt;X3: The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt;. Towards the end of the film, during a confrontation with Shadowcat, Juggernaut says to her, &quot;Don&#039;t you know who I am? I&#039;m the Juggernaut bitch!&quot;. The line is taken from a fan video made by using footage from the early-mid-90s X-men cartoon with blaxploitation style voice-overs. The second example of course would be &lt;em&gt;Snakes on a Plane&lt;/em&gt;, whose famous line comes from a fan video and wasn&#039;t origninally in the film. The popularity of the catchphrase online led to the studio to shoot more footage and add it into the film.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PRT: pt. 4: identity networks!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/292</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Another topic I was thinking about doing was exploring networks that target specific identities. for example, in the last few years there has been the creation of a couple Asian-American TV networks, such as AZN TV and Imaginasian TV, and queer channels, such as LOGO, Here TV, and the now defunct QTV. There have been such channels for awhile, such as BET, Lifetime, Oxygen and Spike TV. However, what interested me about the Asian and the Queer ones (Besides the fact that those are both part of my identities and the channels suck less than Oxygen and Lifetime), is that they are new, so they are in the process of creating what asian-american identity is or what queer identity is in television. this is particularly true with asian-americans, since there is virtually no asian-american programming outside these networks. What statements do these channels say with their programming? Do they cater to a wide audience within their respective targets or do they offer a limited view? At home, I have access to AZN TV. It&#039;s programming is interesting. It has some specifically Asian-American programming, like one that looks at upcoming films, another that looks at asian-american comedians, and another that will document a few students while their applying to ivy league colleges. mixed in with asian-american programming, is straight up asian programming from asia, like those korean dramas i&#039;ve been talking about. in this construction of asian-america, while the channel acknowledges that there is a unique asian-american identity, they create a link with both america and asia by featuring asian programming. asian-american encompasses many different people, it can apply to those who have just immigrated (if they choose to identify as such) or those born here after generations of parents living here. does AZN TV unite these people? in my own experience, my mom would watch the channel alot for her korean soap operas, which is pretty devoid from dealing with the issues of racism that asian-americans have to deal with. however, during the channel promos that would be shown during commercials, various hosts from other shows would talk about their experiences with being asian-american...so my lil asian mommy who doesn&#039;t directly discuss the issues of race and asian-americana becomes exposed to those issues, and i the american can become exposed to asian cultural exports. however, AZN TV is still pretty heterocentric (though there was one segment in the film show once that talked about the queer film &quot;Saving Face&quot; but other than that it&#039;s heterocity). also, almost all the asian-american hosts of shows are east asian, only one is south asian, only one is mixed. AZN TV only represents a very specific segment of Asian-America.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PRT: pt. 3: Wikipedia!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/291</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;3) Wikipedia. There&#039;s a lot to say in how it is deconstructing expert culture, since theoretically everyone has equal access in writing and editing no matter what one&#039;s resume is. does this resemble the messages of some progressive models of critical pedagogy, such as paulo freire&#039;s work about how education is divided up in teacher-students and students-teachers, with a less hierarchal flow of information? Or is this problematic since so many people use it? Is it spreading false information? Or is its rate of accuracy not too different from other sorts of media, but people fear it? Why do people go on wikipedia so much? simply because it&#039;s more accessible? is accessibility more important than accuracy? Because anyone can write what they want, you see the emergence of subjects that usually aren&#039;t taken seriously, from subcultures to pop culture, to the newest technologies, being presented as legitimate topics worth knowing about.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>PRT: pt. 2: the Korean Wave!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/290</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;2) In East Asian countries, like China, and Vietnam, Korean popular culture is ridiculously--.er--.popular. Television dramas, such as Winter Sonata, to singers such as Rain have become phenomenons across Asia. In fact, in 2006, Time Magazine named Rain (who is akin to Usher and JT) the second most influential entertainer in the world. Korean actors are some of the most highest paid outside of Hollywood. This first piqued my interest because a lot of people in my family, including my mom and cousins are really into Korean dramas. Also, when I went to Vietnam, Korean culture was the cool trend, from films to food.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>potential and rejected topics (PRT): a series of blog postings - pt. 1 copyright away!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/288</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow, though I have a tenuous relationship with academia (not comfortable in ivory towers), while unsuccessfully trying to find one thesis topic, everything suddenly became really interesting to me. Here&#039;s a list of random topics that are interesting that I have yet to blog about, though I have no idea whether I will do any of these or not. Everything interests me but not paricularly more than anything, so I think i might settle on wikipedia (since that was what my proposal was on). What do you think my thesis should be on? Just comment on them!&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Music copyright law and its impact on tv/film: With current copyright, its really expensive to get the rights to show someone else&#039;s stuff in your work, even if it&#039;s incidentally there. This is really impacting documentaries. For example, there was this case where in a documentary they were just shooting random people, and someone&#039;s phone when off and the ring tone was the Rocky theme, and the company expected the filmmakers to pay for the rights. How is this impacting filmmaking and television production? In the film, I am Sam, the featuring of Beatles song was an important part of the narrative. However, since the filmmaker couldn&#039;t afford the rights, instead she features Beatles covers, by Rufus Wainwright, Sarah Mclachlan, etc. Another interesting example are these two documentaries about Morrissey and how he has a large Latino fan base. One of them, Viva Morrissey, features a lot of music, and has been having trouble getting rights, and hasn&#039;t been widely distributed, just in festival circuits. Another film, Is It Really So Strange, works around the law by not having music at all, which is pretty interesting, the idea of a music documentary without music. Is the need to work around copyright law creating new innovations?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>post-modern blues: or why i can&#039;t decide on a thesis topic</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/203</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having so much trouble deciding on a thesis topic. I have ingrained the post-modern notions that nothing really matters too much into the cactus where my heart should to be, and now cannot get motivated or committed to anything, and am in no position to pick what i will be spending an entire semester on! Does anyone else have that problem? i feel like i&#039;m more in a position to do a series of mini-theses. I&#039;m kind of interested in a lot, but there&#039;s not too many stuff I&#039;m very interested in, or it&#039;s more like the more i think about it i think of how it really doesn&#039;t matter...aaaah...&lt;/p&gt;
