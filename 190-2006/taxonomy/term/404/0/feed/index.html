 <title>my thesis</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/369</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like my thesis is becoming really one sided.  I am writing about children&#039;s television advertising, and I feel as if everything I read is simply saying, &quot;in this way advertising is bad for kids&quot;.  This is all good and fine as this is a point that I am going to probably spend around a month arguing, but still at the same time I would like to suggest a future alternative that is a positive step forward from the current system.&lt;br /&gt;
	Right now however, I am feeling like I have been hit by the negative train.  Over and over again, because many of the articles and books I have found are saying the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
