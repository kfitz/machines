 <title>And now for something completely diffrent</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/192</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to be talking about House of Leaves right now, and a lot of you have really interesting things to say, but the book messes with my head too much for me to have anything intelligent to say about it, so for the moment I will discuss something else entirely...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Net Flix and lately I haven&#039;t had time for movies, I mean since when do I actually have over an hour of concurrent free time that isn&#039;t sleep? So instead I&#039;ve been getting lots of TV shows from them. The problem is I&#039;ve burned through most of the Simpsons and all of the Futurama that they have, plus a couple of crazy anime series (Serial Experiments Lain fucked with my head in a way similar to House of Leaves), so I&#039;m beginning to look more at live action TV series. I tried &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;, can&#039;t stand it. &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt; was even worse. I hate cop/law dramas, so that counts a lot out, and unlike most people I know I hate both &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt;. I&#039;ve been told I should try &lt;em&gt;Monk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;House MD&lt;/em&gt;, I&#039;ve seen a few episodes randomly and they seem promising. But that&#039;s beside the point. Anyway, last night was one of my biggest strikeouts yet. I took Net Flix and a couple of my friends up on their suggestion that I try &lt;/em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt;, thinking, &quot;oh this will be fun, light-hearted, maybe even a little counter cultural&quot;. I made it through the first episode, put it back in its mailer and sent it back, the worst run of any series yet. I mean no offense to anyone who likes &lt;em&gt;Weeds&lt;/em&gt; or any of the other of the aforementioned TV shows. Many people that I like and respect like at least one, if not more of them, I&#039;m just really picky about TV. But I mean really!&lt;/p&gt;
