 <title>Memory Theatre</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was already interested in our discussion on external memory/externalized sources of knowledge. Then I went to my Digital Art class yesterday and exploring this was a huge part of our lecture. It&#039;s funny how classes can overlap like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we talked about that was most interesting to me was the &quot;memory theatre&quot;. Basically (and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m over-simplifying and leaving something out), the memory theatre was the brainchild of Giulio Camillo back in the sixteenth century. The concept is that, a person is standing on a stage, surrounded by seven different columns and rows, which are organized astrologically, based on the planets and their qualities and characteristics. These rows and columns would contain all the known knowledge in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
