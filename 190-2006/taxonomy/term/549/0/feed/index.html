 <title>selling out can be sneaky</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/478</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously one of the funniest and more important articles that I have read in a while: Business week&#039;s &quot;Hip Hop two-step over product placement.&quot; First off, it includes a photo of one the whiter shade of pale kind of middle-aged man who freely admits to knowing little to nothing about hip hop music, saying he&#039;s more of a &quot;Van Morrison/Eric Clapton kind of guy.&quot; But the article includes snipets of an interview with Russell Simmons, hip hop impressario extraordinaire, who is talking about a deal with McDonalds to pay hip hop and rap artists for including things like &quot;Big Mac&quot; in their lyrics. but he says the deal might not work unless listeners are unaware of said agreement. In other words, Micky D&#039;s is uninterested in publicity that is not sneaky and underhanded. Simmons had the idea to instead produce songs in which rappers would rap about how mcdonald&#039;s wants to throw money at them to reposition their brand and thus create a criticism of the exploitation of hip hop culture and also corruption in adversiting. But then wasn&#039;t it simmons that brokered the deal for P. Diddy to pen &quot;Pass the Courvosier&quot; to reposition that brand? The whole thing seems pretty tricky to me. I may just be naive and optimistic, but I usually figure even commercial artist aren&#039;t always just plugging a product. I&#039;m not saying creative advertising has no place, I just think it would be too bad if art was reduced to a series of commercials. As David Kiley characterizes hip hop, I just want it to return to &quot;a lot of lyrics about bling and money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
