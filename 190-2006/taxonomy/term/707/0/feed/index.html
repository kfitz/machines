 <title>Indigo Prophecy</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/597</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve never actually played this game, so some of what I tell you in this blog may be slightly incorrect, but part of me is simply wondering if anyone has played this. In my Race Theory in the Media course, we have to do a final paper and present what we are discussing to the class. A fellow student in my  course recently presented about an interactive video game called Indigo Prophecy (XBox). It is also known as Fahrenheit. My classmate described it as a combination of narrative film and video game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the player is the main character (Lucas) and makes decisions for the character which change the outcome of the narrative. The game starts with Lucas waking up from a trance after just killing someone. He has to figure out why he killed them before he is arrested. So the opening scene has the player (as Lucas) cleaning up the crime scene. However, the amount of clean-up the player does effects the outcome of the story after that. The person playing the game has several different choices about what to do in each scenario and each choice effects the outcome of the game.  Like I said, I&#039;ve never played, but it sounded pretty interesting.  And pretty relevant to our discussions about narrative and video games.  According to my peer it received a lot of praise for attempting to reinvent this genre of video games and it is pretty interesting.  Just wondering if anyone has ever played before or knows anything about it...&lt;/p&gt;
