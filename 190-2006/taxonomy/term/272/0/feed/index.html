 <title>You should all be ashamed</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kinkade is a man. A man made out of flesh, and blood and most importantly, feelings. I want to you all to follow this link...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and look into the eyes of this man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#039;t want to say this in class, but Thomas Kinkade is my uncle. Every Hannukah that I can remember, my parents, my cousins, Uncle Tom, and myself stay at a small cedar cabin near old Stony Creek. This cabin has been in our family for decades. When Uncle Tom&#039;s wife got pneumonia a few years back and had to stay for weeks in the hospital, my papa said we should sell the cabin to help Uncle Tom pay the bills. But Tom would have none of that. He painted to pay the bills. He insisted that the cabin and all the good times we&#039;ve shared near Stony Creek meant too much to our family. We renamed the cabin in honor of the late Aunt Lois.&lt;/p&gt;
