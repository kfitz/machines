 <title>fans and collaborative authorship</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/411</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In his article &quot;Models of Authorship in New Media,&quot; Manovich brings up &quot;interactivity as collaboration between the author and the user&quot; as another model of authorship. He uses focus groups as an example of this. However, in the last few years, these types of interactions are increasing and becoming even more collaborative. One particular example is the rise in prominence of fan culture. Snakes on the Plane, for instance, is an interesting case of viral marketing, as you all know. The most infamous line from the film, was shot afterwards based on a popular fan created internet video. There was also a music content, where the winners would be featured on the soundtrack of SoaP.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Media Web Design</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really intrigued by Manovich&#039;s discussion of the qualities of new media.  I thought number 3 (Authorship as seleciton from a menu) was particularly interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dorky anecdote: In middle school I used to sneak on the internet after school to learn HTML and work on designing my tripod.com Nirvana fan site.  This was back in the day when turning a hyperlink red instead of nursery school-blue was a big deal, frames were hard to make, and text was presented in long, linear, unadorned chunks.  Little did I know my parents were still paying by the minute for our internet connection and when they caught on after a couple of months when our internet bill skyrocketed, I was internet-grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
