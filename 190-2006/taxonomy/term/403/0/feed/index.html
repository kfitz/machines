 <title>games as stories</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/368</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to play lots of Street Fighter Two, as I was a product of being raised with three brothers.  This was the only fighting game I would play. It was likely because I found satisfaction in playing the character of Chin- Lu (I believe that was her name).  Clearly, at the age of 10 I was unaware of the need for identification with a female in a fighting game, but it worked for me.  I would get into a fight with Ryu, and instead of punching him I would run around in circles imaging that he was her boyfriend and they were being forced to fight by some evil controller.&lt;br /&gt;
	All fantacies aside for Ryu&#039;s fireballs, I wanted their to be an aspect of story in my game.  The only other game I ever got into was Final Fantacy Seven.  Again, this was because of the story behind it.  My brothers on the other hand would likely argue that they enjoyed the fighting aspect of it more.  I was the only one that would take the time to read every character blurb during the narrative parts.&lt;/p&gt;
