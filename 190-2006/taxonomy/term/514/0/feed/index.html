 <title>Senior Seminar in Second Life</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/457</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve talked a bit about Second Life in class, how they have their own economy, news bureau, etc-- But it seems now that Second Life is also becoming involved in the world of education. I read an article this morning, and apparently over 60 schools and other educational organizations are beginning to use Second Life as a pedagogical tool. One of the major ways in which it&#039;s being utilized is with distance learning programs. The article uses a law school class from Harvard as an example. The class is offered both to students who are residents and distance learners. Class discussions, the professor&#039;s office hours, and even some class-related events are held in Second Life. In this case, Second Life can be a way to use 3-D navigable space (props to Manovich!) to create a new, virtual classroom setting. The article also mentioned how this space offers a lot of potential for international students to get involved. This space offers a way for students and professors to interact as a group, regardless of geographical location.&lt;/p&gt;
