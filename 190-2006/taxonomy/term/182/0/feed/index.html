 <title>Mixed Feelings about Man with a Movie Camera</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/169</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me just say that on Wednesday, I really enjoyed Man with a Movie Camera.  I thought it was incredibly visually engaging and groundbreaking (especially considering it was made in 1929).  I left class that night impressed and inspired...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT the following night I watched Berlin: Symphony of a City in another class, and it totally changed my opinion of Man with a Movie Camera.  Remember all that stuff at the beginning about it being a huge, unprecidented experiment? Well... Berlin: Symphony of a City was made in 1927, two years before, and it&#039;s actually strikingly similar.  No &quot;actors,&quot; no &quot;sets,&quot; just the city... and film AS film... not trying to reference the theater, literature, etc... along with tons of montage.  Although I preferred the visuals in Man with a Movie Camera, I lost some respect for the film after seeing that it wasn&#039;t based on a unique concept, which I&#039;d originally been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
