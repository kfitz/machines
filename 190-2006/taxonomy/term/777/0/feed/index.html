 <title>cell phone spying</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/651</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this has been in the news a lot lately. Basicaly, the FBI reserves the right to listen in on your cell phone calls. Everyone knows that. The Washington Post published some articles about that in the 90s. The somewhat cooler thing that&#039;s coming to light these days is that they can also listen to nearby conversations, whether or not you&#039;re on the phone, whether or not your phone is even on. It&#039;s pretty awesome. The even cooler thing is that starting last October, an FCC requirement mandates that the police have the ability to locate any cell phone in America. Isn&#039;t that great?&lt;br /&gt;
