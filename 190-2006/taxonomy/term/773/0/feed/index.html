 <title>no more copyright</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/646</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I propose we abolish copyright laws. They&#039;ve done nothing to advance culture, and everything to ruin my life forever since the day we met. They prevent tons of awesome stuff from ever seeing daylight, and we owe most of the great material we take for granted to copyright breach.&lt;br /&gt;
	The South Park guys were recently interviewed about, among other things, the scientology episode that, despite a very real ban, everyone continues to access at will online. It&#039;s so great. They said something like, &quot;we&#039;re glad folks watch our stuff online. it just means more people get to see it. it&#039;s grrrrrrrrreat.&quot; It sort of reminds me of this thing Tarantino said about Kill Bill, something along the lines of, &quot;yeah, kids, sneak in, I don&#039;t care, I have enough money, anyway.&quot; Basically, artists just want to get their work out, and illegally is the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
