 <description>&lt;p&gt;as i was watching the &quot;what is art&quot; claymation piece from racinian&#039;s recent blog entry, i started thinking about how i miss making creative pieces about theoretical concepts. we did that in high school kind of a lot, but instead of stop-motion we did collages, videos, and some other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a literature class, we filmed a version of the show, &quot;the dating game,&quot; where the three possible choices to date were portia (from julius caesar), scout (to kill a mockingbird), and veruca salt (willy wonka and the chocolate factory). it was hilarious, but really analytical as well with the comments we threw in. my friends and i had so much fun writing the script and doing the acting. this class was AP and very well-taught, yet still fun.&lt;/p&gt;
