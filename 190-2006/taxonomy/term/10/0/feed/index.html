 <description>&lt;p&gt;The beginning of Marchessault&#039;s article alludes to the question, if Shakespeare had a brilliant sister would she have been marginalized, would she have been placed so far out of the context of expression, that from her own hand no similar art would have arose?  Yet, when one looks at the language of Shakespeare&#039;s time it seems, in terms of communicating to the heart of human emotion and spirit we have not moved all that far.   This makes one realize the severity of the battle female authors have fought in such a short period of time to find a space in the literary world, when their expression has been viewed as the other. Is language then read, judged and conceptualized in a phallic space as the reading suggests because it was the norm.  A norm in which female authors had to enter into?  If this is true then the fact that a piece of work was written by a female is an essential part of the piece.  However, Barthes would say that this is part of biography and isn&#039;t essential to the author as subject.  The suggestion of female authors being tied to a feminist, autobiographic and reflective tone, seems to makes this context very important for the reader to receive.  While the reader is still taking their own decoding out of the material that they are reading, the whole concept of female authorship seems to change.  If the female author is dead, or non-present , why is there a reason to discuss her as the marginalized other?&lt;/p&gt;
