 <title>Oprah for Prez</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/126</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I saw this video on CNN today.  It is about a retired man Robert Fulghum from Kansas running a one man campaign &quot;Oprah for President&quot;.  He has written a book by the same name and is currently under the gun of Oprah&#039;s lawyers, who are threatening to sue.   Fulghum even has a website dedicated to the campaign with complete with songs and messages urging supporters to write &quot;Oprah for President&quot; on dollar bills and put them into circulation.&lt;br /&gt;
This made me think of an article I read the other day which stated that more people voted for American Idol than for the presidency in 2004.  Which in turn made me think about a new movie coming out.. The one where Robin Williams runs for presidency as a joke and then gets voted into office.&lt;/p&gt;
