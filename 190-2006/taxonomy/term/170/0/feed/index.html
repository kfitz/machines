 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks. Awhile ago there was a video that was banned on YouTube. It was the music video for the Staten-Island based MC, NY Oil, for his song &quot;Y&#039;all Should get lynched&quot;. The song and music video criticizes mainstream rappers who have &quot;sold out&quot;. The video takes images of these artists, like 50 Cent, Foxy Brown,  (and later condoleezza rice) etc. and juxtapose them with old &quot;coon&quot; and sambo imagery, as well as photos of lynched black men. I was curious what other people thought of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s a link to view the video: http://www.unkut.com/2006/10/lynched-video-banned-by-youtube/. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings myself. On one hand, I agree with what his criticisms are, however I&#039;m not sure if I agree with how he goes about it. Lynching is a very powerfully violent image to provoke. Also, there&#039;s a section of the song where he talks about women, and how they&#039;re disrespecting themselves by shaking their asses. He has a line that says (to an extent cuz i&#039;m doing it by memory) &quot;with your tits popping out...bitch ass hos get pimped, not treated special&quot;, and then  that is followed by clips from a porn where a black woman is being raped by a white men. It felt like he was saying that women who choose to dress or act a certain way, deserve the assaultive treatment they get. in the end, he reproduces a lot of the misogynist and homophobic aspects of mainstream rap, though he challenges an essentialized notion of blackness, he does so by creating another.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Michael Barnes talk</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/529</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to those of you who came to the Michael Barnes talk today!  What did you think?  To be honest, he sort of bored me at the beginning with his discussion of sociological theorists...it just didn&#039;t seem all that dynamic or engaging...BUT I thought he was excellent when he talked about hip hop DJ culture.  It was especially cool that he incorporated music and video clips into his talk (particularly the video clip he recorded at the DMC, which shows that he went to the competition and is really involved in hip hop culture on a personal level).  I think he&#039;d be great as a prof in an elective class on hip hop or any other subject he&#039;s really passionate about, but I think his intro theory courses might make some students fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>QUEER HIP HOP COMES TO CLAREMONT...TOMORROW!!!!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/521</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;TOMORROW, Tuesday, November 28th&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QUEER HIP HOP COMES TO CLAREMONT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#039;Pick Up the Mic&#039; Screening with Q&amp;amp;A AND Homohop artists at Table Manners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#039;Pick Up the Mic&#039; -- Documentary about Queer Hip-Hop, or Homohop: 7:30 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#039;Queer Hip-Hop: it&#039;s a lot more than a stylish oxymoron in this surprising, fast-paced documentary on the world of queer rappers. Featuring searing public performances and raw, revealing interviews with the community&#039;s most significant players, the film captures an unapologetic underground music movement just as it explodes into the mainstream - defying the music industry&#039;s most homophobic genre in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hip to the Hop</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/160</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;hip hop is really good for society. when old people complain that music sucks, they really mean that normal people are allowed to make music, and it makes their palms sweat. that whole disgusting culture started to fade when composers began opting for small groups over big bands. nowadays, half of popular acts require nothing more than a guitar and hair gel. and hip hoppers really don&#039;t even need that. just look at youtube sensation joey jihad (http://youtube.com/watch?v=42qhLhwWj8k), whose clever lyrics and probable links to international terror have taken the nation by storm, bringing smiles to the tear-streaked faces of the fbi agents stationed across the street from his house.&lt;/p&gt;
