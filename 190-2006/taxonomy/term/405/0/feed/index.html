 <title>problematizing the avatar</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;man guys.  class tonight made me so depressed.  it wasn&#039;t the material or the presentation.  well maybe the material, but just because all my classes are pretty heavily theory-based these days and i can&#039;t figure out what theory is other than boring philosophy.  do people really make a living off these essays debating whether games have narrative elements, and do essays like the n0time business get in unedited because people seriously care about this stuff or because the editors decided to play a joke on pretentious academics?  call me crazy but i got to thinking in class that the devil had designed theory to keep our minds occupied so we miss all the real stuff around us.  kind of like the radio.  there is so much going on.  crazy turkmenbashi is trying to build an ice palace in the desert. a million japanese guys are playing video games for decades &amp;amp; refusing to leave their rooms.  isn&#039;t tibet the only place in the world where polygamy is one female with multiple husbands?  dark matter is mindblowing &amp;amp; the multiverse seriously problemitizes our definition of auteur. (why do we say auteur?  in grad school do you just say everything in french to sound smarter?)  &amp;amp; why when i&#039;m frustrated do i say &quot;man guys&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
