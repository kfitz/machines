 <description>&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it filesharing, the more uncertain I become about its effects on the music industry.  Lessig writes that roughly 28% of Americans older than 12 had downloaded music.  I doubt a significant number of people over 55 download anything, which bumps the number of actual to potential users up to maybe 1/2.  So who are the people who are downloading music, and who isn&#039;t?  Everyone I know who is extremely into music downloads almost everything, and buys only the best of the best albums, having listened to a much broader selection.  If everyone did this, it could have a natural selection-esque effect on the industry and force artists to constantly come up with innovative music to meet the higher standards.&lt;/p&gt;
