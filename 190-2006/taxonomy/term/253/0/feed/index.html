 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I read this quote &quot;If who I am matters LESS, maybe what I SAY will matter MORE.&quot;  I thought, well I suppose this is why we are reading understanding comics in a authorship class.  The idea of identification through simplification and generalization makes sense, I had just never thought of it before.  It is interesting however, that this doesn&#039;t directly apply to other forms of representation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fictional book for example, we do not want the main character to be simplified to the point where we identify with them.  On the contrary we want explicit details in order to gain a better understanding of their complex inner workings.  I think we need this to make them real, so that we are no longer fully reading them as a character, but rather as a person. We find identity though other means, by their feelings emotions, actions est.&lt;/p&gt;
