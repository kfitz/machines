 <title>Game Trailers</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/361</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that I thought was interesting in the readings was Zimmerman&#039;s reference to video games suffering from a bad case of &quot;cinema envy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is pretty evident &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AgVGPba6SA&quot;&gt; in this trailer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, this video game is being released with the MOVIE Eragon, but still.  It subscribes to the same theatrical methods of a full-length feature film.  I think it really demonstrates how we, the consumers, have come to expect some sort of &quot;story&quot; with our games, and the industry has responded by attempting to link their products to the successful multi-billion dollar movie industry (even though, as we learn in the book, the game industry is larger).  I feel as though I&#039;ve seen dozens of flashy, bright, melodramatic trailers for video games.  They are hard to take seriously, because come on!  It&#039;s a video game.  It&#039;s not like the user is ever going to make their character do anything but destroy bad guys.  And yet the marketing strategy is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
