 <title>gimmick vs. thought provoking</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/349</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After I posted, I thought of another good example of how the relationship between form and content could either seem interesting or just gimicky.&lt;br /&gt;
I am reminded of the difference between the films, &quot;Time Code&quot; by Mike Figgis and &quot;Memento&quot; by Christopher Nolan. (Did I make a concsious choice in saying who the author of the film was? Did I preface the director over the screenwriter or vice versa? Well in both films, the director was the screenwriter, so no choice between the two had to be made!) Granted, I saw Time Code once when I was 14, so maybe if I watch it again my opinion would be different. In Time Code, the screen is divided into four segments, and in each segment the viewer simultaneously. The story deals with love, sex, infidelity, with people working within the entertainment industry. The structure in a way did make the story, in the sense, that in one frame we see a woman witnessing her girlfriend cheating on her (she hid a mic on her girlfriend somehow, and was listening to the sounds in her car) while in the other frame, we see the situation of the cheating. you can see different angles of the same stories, it&#039;s layered, etc. Howver, I felt that this story didn&#039;t complement the structure well enough. It was just kind of a soap opera-y tale of people working in Hollywood. While the content was enhanced by the structure, in didn&#039;t take full advantage of the unique structure.&lt;/p&gt;
