 <title>you guys should really delete your facebook accounts</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;seriously. facebook is very stupid. i&#039;m glad people are finally starting to realize that, you know, no one will ever care about facebook until you&#039;re on trial for multiple church arson. a friend of mine at berkeley used his e-mail address (gpd@berkeley.edu - e-mail him your thanks and praise) to set up a facebook account for a fictional person named Gloria Dane. Although she didn&#039;t exist in the strictest sense, she was very popular on facebook, where every day her facebook mail was flooded with new invitations from the hosts of upcoming parties, the leadership of exclusive clubs, and the legions of facebook friend hopefuls.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Potential Thesis Topics</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/149</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have been mulling over thesis for a months now and have now come up with a new idea. Initially I began to toy with it when Facebook brought us the News Feed a few weeks ago but when it opened up to the public a few days ago, I pretty much decided this is somewhere I wanted to go with thesis. SO anyway, previously I had wanted to write about the publics increasing desire to participate in the authorship of media (ex Snakes on a Plane) and how this could potentially affect media in the  future. But now, I&#039;d like to maybe write about the overexposure of personal information through networks sch as myspace and facebook and how that affects identity. I would definitely have to take into account the publics reaction on new facebook features, such as the news feed and public access. I&#039;m beginning to wonder why facebook is trying harder and harder to become some sort of myspace when what I used to like about it is that it was different enough for me to want to join it. I guess we&#039;ll have to see how recent decisions regarding its layout will change who joins it and who doesnt, and maybe even who leaves it.&lt;/p&gt;
