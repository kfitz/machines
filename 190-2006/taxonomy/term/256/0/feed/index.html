 <title>closure time</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/239</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was watching tv with my friend who is one of those obsessive channel changers.  I mean, this is borderline put this compulsive behavior into a book for diagnosis.  He changes the channels I would say on average, every 2 minutes.  So, I am sitting there trying to watch with him some Sports Center show, then some TBS movie, than a crappy MTV game show, then -- With every switch of the channel I get sucked into the next show. I want to see if the man can break the record for largest pizza dough ever tossed, but alas there is the click and we move on in television world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frustrating yes, but when one is in the middle of reading Understanding Comics it at least has the interesting aspect of being able to relate this to closure.  The television is like a world of its own where channels are constantly broadcasting giving the shows life.  If I am not watching a particular show however, I don&#039;t think about it&#039;s possibility as an existing form of entertainment for me.  When the channel gets changed and I don&#039;t get to learn if the bomb ever went off, it ceases to exist for me.  I can still perceive the whole though, because I am made aware of the fact that the show is going to come to some sort of a conclusion.  It is my experience with television that tells me something more must be there even when no longer focusing on the reality of the show.  So, this is what I was thinking about as my friend changed the channels.&lt;/p&gt;
