 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was reading my astronomy homework the other day and came across the Spectral classification of stars. If any of you know, they range is O,B,A,F,G,K,M,L,T arranged from hottest (blue) to coldest (red) and then L and T arenor really stars but are recent additions to the spectral classification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. I was informed by the chatty text that our Sun is classified as a G star. Specificallya G-2 star.And then I remembered that clothing company, G-Star RAW that the european guys wear and I thought that there had to be a connection with the name of the clothing company and astronomy. And so I thought, how smart. Its always nice to see a smart or witty company or name of something in contrast to the bland names most things seem to have. SO I decided to take a look at the compant website to see a bio for the company to see if I was right regarding the name connection. (Found at http://www.g-star.com/flash/content.html)&lt;/p&gt;
