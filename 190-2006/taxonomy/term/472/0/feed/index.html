 <title>BECK</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/431</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have recently become the owner of Beck&#039;s recently released album, The Information.  As a devoted fan and future girlfriend of Beck, I felt required to post on its awesomeness. Aside from being his best album since Odelay, Beck has outdone himself yet again on originality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part actually has to do with our class so pay attention. The Information was released as a CD/DVD combo and the DVD features a music video to accompany each song.  I read a review prior to the release of the CD which annoys me now because I can&#039;t remember where I read it and also can&#039;t remember all that Beck said about the album. However, I do remember that he said he had been wanting to do a CD/DVD combo for a long time now because he thinks that it comes closer to how we should experience music, as this totally sensationally stimulating medium. Kinda interesting in terms of our recent discussion about the level of immersion allowed by new media forms.&lt;/p&gt;
