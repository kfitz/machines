 <title>Hamlet on the Holodeck, Drama &amp; Culture</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/389</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;K I wrote this one in my notebook and forgot to type it up, so I&#039;m skipping way back to Hamlet on the Holodeck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 10 of Murray&#039;s Hamlet on the Holodeck focused on the &quot;kaleidoscopic world&quot; that can be represented with new digital media, allowing audiences to choose which characters to follow among a variety of choices, and perhaps by a variety of authors.  Murray writes that this &quot;can feel to some like an unauthored world,&quot; but I see it as a much more appropriate representation of the real world - in which we each have a unique vantage point, and can get closer or distance ourselves from the perspectives of others.  This &quot;ability to capture experience as systems of interrelated actions&quot; suggests that narratives will become more complex in the future, broadening the &quot;good guy/bad guy&quot; stance taken by many television shows and movies to expose the intimate perspectives and motives of each character - something the traditional television show or movie does not have the time to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
