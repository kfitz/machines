 <title>Final adieu</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/656</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I have nothing of value to blog about and I don&#039;t think I could form an academic thought if I wanted to right now, I am going to write a farewell blog instead; a commemorative tribute if you will to my final blog of the semester and perhaps the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note I would like to take a moment to reflect on my short career as a blogger. While I have enjoyed the blog a lot more than I had originally anticipated, I hesitate to think that I would ever blog of my own volition. In terms of class discussion, I would so much rather blog than be writing reading response papers all the time like some classes require. There is just something about the blogging format that is more inviting than staring a blank word document.&lt;/p&gt;
