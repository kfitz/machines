 <title>Thoughts on &quot;Models of Pride&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/382</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I (somehow) dragged myself out of bed at 7:30am to go to &quot;Models of Pride,&quot; which is an annual LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) youth conference held at Occidental College. A lot of the workshops were media-related, so I thought I&#039;d just blog about my experience at the conference and some of the things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part One, or omg I&#039;m old:&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, the description of the event says it&#039;s a youth conference geared towards queer youth between the ages of 14 and 23. However, when I got there, I definitely felt that it was geared more towards high school students. When we were in small groups for an &quot;icebreaker,&quot; my group of 12 had about 3 people over 18. But everyone was really nice. But I still felt really old basically the whole time I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>&quot;HIV is a gay disease&quot;?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was reading this article today online about the LA Gay and Lesbian Center&#039;s new ad campaign to fight the spread of HIV. Basically, the ads say &quot;HIV is a gay disease. Own it. End it.&quot; The goal is to target apathetic gay men, which I think is valid, but the way they&#039;re going about seems seriously flawed to me.   &quot;HIV/AIDS is a gay disease&quot; is a stereotype that the queer community has been fighting against since the disease was discovered. It has been used as a justification for homophobia. I don&#039;t think that using language that comes out of a tradition of homophobic rhetoric is the wrong way to go. It also glosses over the ever increasing numbers of black women with AIDS today. There has to be a better way to raise awareness about HIV, for gay men and for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
