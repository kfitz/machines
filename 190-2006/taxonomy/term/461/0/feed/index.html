 <title>Rebirth of a Nation</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about Manovich&#039;s discussion of remixing in &quot;Models of Authorship in New Media,&quot; when I remembered a really interesting example that I encountered in one of my classes last semester. DJ Spooky (aka Paul D. Miller) is a writer and DJ who recently created a project called &quot;Rebirth of a Nation&quot;. This piece is basically a remix of the technically brilliant yet horribly racist film &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;. DJ Spooky remixes both the images and the sound, providing his own soundtrack. He says that, &quot;By remixing the film along the lines of dj culture, I hoped to create a counter-narrative, one where the story implodes on itself, one where new stories arise out the ashes of that explosion.&quot; To me, this approach seemed very much in line with Manovich&#039;s view of remix. DJ Spooky aims to engage with the film in deeper, more deliberate manner than is implied by a term like &quot;appropriation&quot;. As Manovich says, &quot;&#039;remixing&#039; is a better term because it suggests a systematic re-working of a source, the meaning which &#039;appropriation&#039; does not have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
