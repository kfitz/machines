 <title>Thesis madness</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/199</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m currently trying to write my thesis proposal, but despite the fact that I have an outline and quotes, my brain is saying no. I was thinking, maybe if I blog about it, I can get the juices flowing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, my thesis is about Black rockers, postmodern black identities, and virtual communities. Like we talked about when we discussed the bell hooks article, &quot;Postmodern Blackness,&quot; postmodernism has often been overlooked by the black community, yet it holds some really powerful ideas that could help to create conceptions of black identity that are more fluid, open, relevant to contemporary black lives, and that take into account the reality of diversity in the black community. I&#039;ve come across two terms that describe this: post-black and newblack. I haven&#039;t entirely figured what the difference between these two are, but newblackness is defined as a contemporary moment in blackness which &quot;embodies a radical fluidity within the spheres of blackness that allow for powerful conceptualizations across black genders, sexualities, ethnicities... socioeconomic positions, and socially constructed performances of &#039;black&#039; identity&quot;(Neal 122).&lt;/p&gt;
