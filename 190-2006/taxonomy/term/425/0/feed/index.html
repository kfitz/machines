 <description>&lt;p&gt;SO this weekend a student-directed theatre production, STOPKISS, went up. And yours truly was overzealous enough to agree to help stage manage rehearsals -- and seeing the final product really got me thinking about authorship and theatre. I haven&#039;t delved too deeply in this yet, but I wonder if a part of it&#039;s unique appeal is how authorship is constantly shifting in the message/meaning of a play. A playwright does his or her thing, and writes the text and all that. Then a director reads, feels inspired, and pitches his or her vision to a producer to get the thing up. Then actors interpret and create, and finally an audience receives the combined efforts, and I wonder how that equation flow chart actually manages to not come off as completely schizophrenic and impossible to comprehend. It seems almost miraculous, but then again it would also lead to me new conclusions about why live theatre, hell live performances, are only attended by less than 2% of the American Population.  26% apparently still go see movies -- at least 3 a year or month, I can&#039;t remember exactly, whereas 98% watch television regularly--&lt;/p&gt;
