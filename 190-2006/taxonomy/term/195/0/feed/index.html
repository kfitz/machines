 <description>&lt;p&gt;Is iTunes Slowly Dying (http://www.playfuls.com/news_05513_Is_iTunes_Slowly_Dying.html)? I certainly hope so. ITunes sucks so hard, I can barely find the words. I mean, I would obviously never allow that monster to live in my computer, but it has conquered the hearts and minds of millions of computers across the globe, taking up the entire screen, demanding indecent volumes of memory, bringing entire operating systems to their knees.&lt;br /&gt;
	But a death-rattle has finally escaped her monstrous lips, which can mean only one thing: that people are finally figuring out how to use computers. Never again will anyone submit to the will of iTunes (I want some music, but I don&#039;t want to have to go to the store. HMMMMMMMMMM! I don&#039;t know! I guess I should go to ITUNES and PAY for my music!). Hah!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Short Notes on House of Leaves</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/184</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about House of Leaves I&#039;m beginning to notice since beginning the book on Thursday, and most aren&#039;t so much the book as my reaction to it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the footnotes are getting SO old.  Some were really interesting (I&#039;m thinking in particular about the one that directed the reader to the Whalestoe Letters), others were helpful, but once I got to the pages with the blue squares in the middle of the pages in which the footnotes listed, you know, various forms of housing insulation...  I mean, come on.  It&#039;s hard to work up the gumption to continue reading these weird asides and footnotes when all you&#039;re finding in them is a big list of semi-irrelevant things and on top of that, in order to figure out that they are mostly irrelevant, you have to grab a mirror!  What gives, Danielewski!&lt;/p&gt;
