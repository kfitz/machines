 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was having a conversation a while back with my favorite Media Studies-hating friend while we were watching television. We saw one of those many commercials that have begun springing up in which a brief part of a story is told or something and then the commercials ends with an encouragement to go visit the website for more of the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His conclusion was that this was pretty stupid. He had never followed those directions and was kind of offended that the company was making him do more of their work. If they wanted to advertise to him, they should do it on their time, not on his. Going to their website would just mean buying into their whole marketing scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
