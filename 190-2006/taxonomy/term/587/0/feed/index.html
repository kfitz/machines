 <title>Colonial House</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/511</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This was sparked by ghostwriter&#039;s post, Yr colonial fantasty (or something like that). I have all these half-finished posts saved on my desktop that I need to catch up on posting. here is one of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember the show Colonial House on PBS? I was super addicted to it for awhile. It&#039;s part of this series of reality shows that, yes, even PBS had (including 1940&#039;s house, the 1900 house, frontier house, manor house, texas ranch house, etc.). The crux of these shows are to explore how modern day individuals would cope and react to trying to re-enact certain moments in history. Colonial House (which is the only one I&#039;ve watched so far), shows a group of diverse individuals who try to recreate the colonial life of the year 1628. It includes a diverse cast, in terms of class, family situation, race and even sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
