 <title>Models are people too, just not when they&#039;re on TV</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So in lieu of doing anything productive on a Sunday night (they&#039;re sacred, right?), I watched America&#039;s Next Top Model. I obviously wasn&#039;t expecting anything substantial, culturally aware, or even entertaining - just something to kill time. But it&#039;s deliberate avoidance of any of these ideas was incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just one episode, a girl admitted to having attempted suicide, and a Spanish guy told one of the models that he &quot;didn&#039;t like black girls.&quot; Meanwhile we are supposed to be focused on the trials of the competition: &quot;Nobody thinks I want this bad enough,&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t feel pretty enough,&quot; &quot;No one thinks models feel.&quot; The suicide attempt confession was blurted out during one of the &quot;challenges&quot; and after the shocked reaction shots, no one bothered ot mention it again. Except for saying that she was really brave and strong, it was a non-issue or even plotline in the show. She won the challenge for being so strong and brave.. and cut to her on One Tree Hill as a guest star. Whoo - suicide attempts make you a strong person with more emotion to tap into when you&#039;re acting.&lt;/p&gt;
