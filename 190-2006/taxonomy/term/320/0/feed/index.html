 <title>&quot;I&#039;m the Juggernaut, bitch!&quot; or Fan Videos in Action</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/293</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really interested me in &lt;em&gt;Hamlet on the Holodeck&lt;/em&gt; was Murray&#039;s discussion of fan-fiction. Although fan-fiction exists in many forms, I think that now we&#039;re seeing more and more fan videos, and with the widespread use of YouTube, these are becoming more accessible to viewers. For example, from Harry Potter, to Batman, to Saved by the Bell, there&#039;s a plethora of gay slash fan videos on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fan-fiction tends to remain in its own bubble, generally either ignored or hated by the companies that produced the original texts (or in the case of Anne Rice, banned. What a bitch.). But in the past couple of years, there have been two incidents where fan videos have actually influenced film production. The first one is &lt;em&gt;X3: The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt;. Towards the end of the film, during a confrontation with Shadowcat, Juggernaut says to her, &quot;Don&#039;t you know who I am? I&#039;m the Juggernaut bitch!&quot;. The line is taken from a fan video made by using footage from the early-mid-90s X-men cartoon with blaxploitation style voice-overs. The second example of course would be &lt;em&gt;Snakes on a Plane&lt;/em&gt;, whose famous line comes from a fan video and wasn&#039;t origninally in the film. The popularity of the catchphrase online led to the studio to shoot more footage and add it into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
