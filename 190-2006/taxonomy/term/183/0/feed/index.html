 <title>&quot;HIV is a gay disease&quot;?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I was reading this article today online about the LA Gay and Lesbian Center&#039;s new ad campaign to fight the spread of HIV. Basically, the ads say &quot;HIV is a gay disease. Own it. End it.&quot; The goal is to target apathetic gay men, which I think is valid, but the way they&#039;re going about seems seriously flawed to me.   &quot;HIV/AIDS is a gay disease&quot; is a stereotype that the queer community has been fighting against since the disease was discovered. It has been used as a justification for homophobia. I don&#039;t think that using language that comes out of a tradition of homophobic rhetoric is the wrong way to go. It also glosses over the ever increasing numbers of black women with AIDS today. There has to be a better way to raise awareness about HIV, for gay men and for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
