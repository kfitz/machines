 <title>Various thoughts</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am just going to go ahead and make some general observations on the readings. I have no idea whether or not these observations have already been made because like most of you, this week has not been the best week for me to begin the ever-so daunting task of blogging. Thus I shall make my first true blog only three hours before class with hopes that next week I will be blogging with a little more punctuality.  Anyway, my thoughts on the readings were varied.  I found the articles to be somewhat scattered at times but there were some very valid and interesting points made throughout.&lt;br /&gt;
	One point that I found particularly interesting to me in the Foucault article was when he interrogated the term &quot;work.&quot;  He writes, &quot;What in short, is the strange unit designated by the term, work? What is necessary to its composition, if work is not something written by a person called an &quot;author?&quot;  He continues to propose the question, &quot;If an individual is not an author, what are we to make of those things he has written or said--?&quot;  This really got me thinking.  Knowing next to nothing about art, a similar question has often crossed my mind.  Once someone is considered to be an artist, is everything he or she creates from then on considered art as well?  Where are we to draw the line?  Just as Foucault says, &quot;Assuming that we are dealing with an author, is everything he wrote and said, everything he left behind, to be included in his work?&quot;  It is a very interesting question and one that I feel is deeply intertwined with the question of authorship and what exactly it means to be an author.&lt;/p&gt;
