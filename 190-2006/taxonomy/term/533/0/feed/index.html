 <description>&lt;p&gt;I read an article today about soda.  It said that kids today are consuming soda at an alarming rate. Duh duh duh.  No, but really it is a problem.  The article said that kids, &quot;drink twice as much soda as milk, a reverse of figures noted 20 years ago&quot;, and that &quot;the average soda consumption among teenage males between ages 13 and 18 who drink soda is three or more cans a day, and 10% drink seven or more cans a day. Of 13- to 18-year-old girls who drink the beverages, the average intake is more than two cans a day, and 10% of those teenagers drink more than five cans a day.&quot;  It then goes on to talk about the implications for sugar intake on diabetes and obesity and how schools are implementing programs to try reduce these rates.&lt;/p&gt;
