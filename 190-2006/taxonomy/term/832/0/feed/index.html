 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://globalo.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;a blog i bet you all will appreciate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was reading all of these amazing last-minute homestretch blogs, which are pretty awesome in general (thanks for all the links, lindsay) and somehow my neighbor heard what i was up to and recommended me to check out that global o site, seeing as how i was getting such a kick out of the internet. i thought the home website (globalorgasm.org) was pretty kickass, but the fact that there was a BLOG link got me way too excited - and reminded me of these lurking blogs that i need to complete... ah enough of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as i was seeking inspiration for a blog topic (slash surfing the net), i stumbled across MORE information about this horny manatee business. these underground flash phenomena really blow my mind -- especially how the internet can help encourage and support likeminded people into action. but i can&#039;t help but wonder to what end? like this global orgasm thing for example, more power to the movement (and i hope you all participate, and continue to take me somewhat seriously as a person...) hopefully it will make a positive peaceful difference in the world - oh tangent here, but has anyone seen &quot;a constant gardener&quot;? i just watched it and it was amazing and everything, but the realities of corruption were still hard for me to handle. and this movie had such a social consciousness and was still critically acclaimed, i hope it opened up some minds at least... -- and yeah, back to media making a difference, i like where this is going so i posted it for you all - but at the same time i also think it&#039;s hilarious. same with the manatee stuff, i know it was born from a conan skit but i mean over a million hits in a few days? thats hella popular, right? and the same with postsecret.blogspot.com - all of these websites have caught my attention in that they are crazy popular for the simple basic concepts shown on the web. i still can&#039;t wrap my head around it - and more importantly to me, how this can be converted into real actual change.&lt;/p&gt;
