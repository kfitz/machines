 <title>The controversy of Lonelygirl15</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/118</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Why did I stay up until 2:00 in the morning last night without any homework due today? I blame it on you, Achillesheel. Last week you posted a very interesting entry about Lonelygirl15, the video blogger, &quot;Bree,&quot; with mass viewership (100s of thousands/entry), who, as it turns out, is nothing more than the creation of three 23 year-old men and the actress they hired to play the main character. After reading your entry, I started checking out the vlog. What first drew me in was its mundane and uneventful nature. Lives really aren&#039;t that interesting on a moment to moment basis and &quot;Bree&quot; doesn&#039;t claim hers to be otherwise. The girl&#039;s dull presentation of lackluster subjects -- how her friend, Daniel, is lazy and rarely does anything, for example - leaves much to be desired. I wondered, what is it about this vlog that has intrigued so many people? (If any of you want to watch a couple of episodes, the link is at the bottom and I&#039;d love to have this puzzle explained to me.) Not able to figure out the answer after a few &quot;episodes,&quot; I had to watch more. It was not a good cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
