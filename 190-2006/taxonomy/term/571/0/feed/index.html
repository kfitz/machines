 <title>If I did it, or I did it?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/501</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I know that someone already posted about OJ Simpson&#039;s new/cancelled book &quot;If I did it,&quot; but now that it has become a media uproar and book and interview have both been pulled, I think it warrants another post. According to todays LA Times article, &quot;cries of censorship did not materialize in the protest.&quot; So I&#039;m going to cry.. if only to play devil&#039;s advocate or something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As disgusting and hurtful as the book&#039;s content is, I have to reference Voltaire (I think?). I disagree with what you say, but i will defend to my death your right to say it. I don&#039;t know if this adage will really extend to include a tell-all murder book, but it&#039;s an interesting question to ask ourselves. Is the book just offensive or truly hurtful/dangerous? OJ actually kind of seems to be arguing for his first amendment rights: &quot;I think I&#039;m legally muzzled at this point.&quot; So I guess I&#039;m not the only one crying censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
