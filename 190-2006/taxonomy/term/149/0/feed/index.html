 <description>&lt;p&gt;as i was watching the &quot;what is art&quot; claymation piece from racinian&#039;s recent blog entry, i started thinking about how i miss making creative pieces about theoretical concepts. we did that in high school kind of a lot, but instead of stop-motion we did collages, videos, and some other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a literature class, we filmed a version of the show, &quot;the dating game,&quot; where the three possible choices to date were portia (from julius caesar), scout (to kill a mockingbird), and veruca salt (willy wonka and the chocolate factory). it was hilarious, but really analytical as well with the comments we threw in. my friends and i had so much fun writing the script and doing the acting. this class was AP and very well-taught, yet still fun.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>That&#039;s child&#039;s play</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/570</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to that lunch with one of the new potential profs yesterday and she got me thinking about a topic I don&#039;t feel we talk about much as media studies majors -- children and the media. She compared regular schools with Montessori and Waldorf schools (which severely limit if not totally eliminate) media in the classroom and said she much prefers the regular schools&#039; system of media exposure. (Apparently, Waldorf schools even go so far as to prohibit the families of the children from owning a television!) The professor was definitely very against these policies. She said she would never send her child to a school like that because they go so against what she believes in. She felt that so much of children&#039;s play stems from things children have seen on TV shows and in other media that it would be wrong to prohibit children from having access to movies, television, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Defining Generation Y</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/450</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So of course, after posting about &quot;Generation Y&quot;, I had to go look it up on wikipedia...  On the site they have a list of &quot;major cultural events&quot; that are associated with Generation Y, and I just thought I&#039;d post it so that you guys can see if it seems accurate / enjoy it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popularity of The Transformers&lt;br /&gt;
The Cabbage Patch Kids and Care Bear crazes of the early 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;
The New Kids on the Block, Guns N&#039; Roses, Vanilla Ice, and MC Hammer crazes of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;
The popularity of the Disney Afternoon shows in the early and mid 1990s.&lt;br /&gt;
The popularity of the Ghostbusters media and merchandise in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Talking About my Generation?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/449</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Just thought I&#039;d start this before running off to dinner...  I was in class today and the professor asked us if we were Generation Rx, a question that sparked basically the largest digression from discussion in the history of that class, and launched us into repeating every label our generation&#039;s encountered so far.  These included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation Rx, apparently&lt;br /&gt;
Generation Y, or &quot;why?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Generation Me&lt;br /&gt;
iGeneration&lt;br /&gt;
MTV Generation&lt;br /&gt;
Generation 9/11&lt;br /&gt;
Echo Boomers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting to me for a couple reasons.  One, when do we become generationally situated?  Or how much time has to pass for one of these generational namesakes to stick?  We have Generation X before us, and the Baby Boomers before them-- those are pretty solidified.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Thoughts on &quot;Models of Pride&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/382</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I (somehow) dragged myself out of bed at 7:30am to go to &quot;Models of Pride,&quot; which is an annual LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) youth conference held at Occidental College. A lot of the workshops were media-related, so I thought I&#039;d just blog about my experience at the conference and some of the things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part One, or omg I&#039;m old:&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, the description of the event says it&#039;s a youth conference geared towards queer youth between the ages of 14 and 23. However, when I got there, I definitely felt that it was geared more towards high school students. When we were in small groups for an &quot;icebreaker,&quot; my group of 12 had about 3 people over 18. But everyone was really nice. But I still felt really old basically the whole time I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Simple, Practical Applications of Media to Education</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/143</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I met with my potential first reader for thesis, I was very impressed with his ideas for simple, yet practical applications of media to education. The ideas particularly resounded with me, because over the summer I had an internship at the University of California, San Diego, in their Professional Development Institute, which dealt with helping teachers better their techniques. We held a conference for the Los Angeles Unified School District (Local District 6) for ESL (English as a Second Language) kids, as well as a retreat for a new charter school that didn&#039;t know how to find resources. Both could use simple applications of media to help kids in their classroom and find administrative resources. Also, I read some e-newsletters on the use of technology and education with input from teachers on what worked for them, and my potential thesis reader&#039;s ideas were very much inline with the ideas teachers reported worked best. Here are some of his ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
