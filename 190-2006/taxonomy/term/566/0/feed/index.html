 <title>Rant</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/495</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I think I really don&#039;t do this much in the blogspace, but I feel like ranting today. Maybe it&#039;s this meeting that i have today to try and convince Dean Clark to let me graduate a semester early (something I think should be a no brainer as long as all my credits/requirement/thesis are done). Maybe it&#039;s finals time or my trip to Vegas. Whatever, this little blurb of an editorial about a fairly trivial thing just set me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#039;re putting TVs in the LA transportation buses. Sounds fun, huh? like JetBlue TVs on transcontinental flights so you can watch crappy movies you wouldn&#039;t have payed to see otherwise but will secretly enjoy. But these ones will be on the entire time over speakers that will probably emit sound between volume levels of loud and ear-splitting. Plus, commercials.. lots of them. And targeted at the specific &quot;bus riding demographic&quot; (i.e. poor people without cars). I don&#039;t know about anyone else, but I actually love riding buses - it&#039;s a time to zen out on the slowly moving cityscape, or delve into a book, or people watch - but for the most part it is a silent activity (other than eavesdropping on close conversations and the occasional alcoholic/drug induced outburst). It&#039;s kind of like swimming or something - tune out if you want to. But now books and conversations and even outbursts will have to contend with bad credit advertisements and worthlessly summarized news broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
