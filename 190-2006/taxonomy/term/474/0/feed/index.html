 <title>Not a blog for the ages.</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/433</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So this blog is definitely not one to go down in history. (Wow, I had to spell definitely five times before spell check could even register it, that is sad and pathetic.)  I have been struggling in terms of content for my blogs this week but I said I would pump out two of these babies tonight and by God, I will do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes, I was doing reading for my creative journalism class and a very dim light bulb flickered in the distant reaches of my mind that it might be something I could blog about so that&#039;s what I&#039;m gonna do.  The book I was reading is Robert&#039;s Rules of Writing, authored by my professor Robert Masello.  Despite being a clever attempt to boost book sales by making it required reading, the book is an attempt to give the reader &quot;101 unconventional lessons that every writer needs to know.&quot;  Rule #47 Lay Down the Law, warns readers that &quot;when you&#039;re writing, you&#039;re creating your own world on the page,and in that world you are God. So act it.&quot; The  rule cited the short-lived popularity of make your own adventure books. My professor argued that these stories failed to become a staple in publishing circles because readers don&#039;t want to have to choose their own ending. He said if readers wanted to choose what happened in a narrative they would write the book themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
