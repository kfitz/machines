 <title>Borat</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/380</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In light of the Borat movie release this weekend, I would like to discuss Ali G (Baron Cohen) and his other fun filled characters. Wine, I like.  I read this article where the author was trying to sound self-important because she had experienced a moment in which she was able to speak with Baron Cohen himself, (out of character).  Apparently this is rare.  The article talked about how he keeps up his character face in any interview even in light of the political issues that have been brought up surrounding the Borat movie. He still responds as Borat.&lt;br /&gt;
      Another reporter in the article was making the argument that when reporters speak to him in character they are not fully doing their job, that of seeking information.  What they are doing is further promoting his act.  They are simply being another venue in which Borat is gaining popularity instead of getting at the real issues of who Baron Cohen is and why he is doing this.  We don&#039;t really ever get to know what he thinks about the fact that his Borat My Space page says he lives &quot;three mile north of fence to jewtown&quot;. I think this is of course fitting because he is in the genre of comedy, the moment he makes commentary, it becomes a little to serious.  But it is true that they are never going to get a real answer out of him, from the point of view of what the artist thinks of his creation if he is always talking as the man from Kzakhstan.  Perhaps Barbara Walters could get a compelling interview out of him.  Make him squeeze out a few tears?! It could happen.  Or Opera?  She might be able to do it.  Here are some fun controversy facts I found on the Wik:&lt;/p&gt;
