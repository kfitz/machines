 <title>fear and authorship</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/518</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;No one needs to read this post, since (and again I apologize) I just feel like venting a little about the state of my senior project in vain hope that maybe I&#039;ll actually gain some resolve to sit down and do this thing... I am so nervious. Nervious like when I was writing my college admissions essay. Nervous like doing a watercolor painting makes me nervous. I am going to fail at this, and I really really don&#039;t want to. I will not be happy or satisfied or even mildly proud of what I produce. So my question is, how does any author begin a project. I think I just must not be cut out for this creative business - do great artists pussyfoot about a subject they want to address and try their damndest to delay any actual work forever, trying to preserve the image/idea/perfection in their minds forever without soiling the canvas of their concept with actual paint/writing/action? No - they bite their lip and dive in and fail - over and over and over - with only glimmers of something they actually like. My mom is a painter (I guess the artistic gene skips a generation), and she talks about the stages of her paintings - elation at the blank canvas and brilliant idea recedes into a building frustration at the disparity between her mind&#039;s eye and the canvas itself. Then comes the quitting point, the hating phase, the worthless-piece-of-shit-throw-it-in-the-garbage phase. Finally, there&#039;s a breakthrough and it leads to changes that make the piece bearable. Frankly, this process just sounds painful to me and all you get in the end is ta-dah, something that is bearable. So, I&#039;m trying to stay in the shiny, happy phase one as long as possible - which is making my timeline increasingly compressed. I am frightened of becoming an author, especially of something I am invested in beyond school. Intimidating to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
