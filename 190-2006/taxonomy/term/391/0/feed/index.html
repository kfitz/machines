 <title>Authorship and Intention (and some other random thoughts)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/353</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Post Secret is a website??? Why did you tell me this? This could be very bad... A friend of mine has the Post Secret book, and I found myself completely sucked in. Now I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll become addicted to the website too. (For those who didn&#039;t read the post earlier today on Authorship and the Internet, Post Secret is this thing where people send postcards to this guy named Frank Warren sharing their most personal secrets. Warren then selects which submissions to post in books and on the website. He is also allowed to edit the submissions if he wants to.) I get a weird feeling reading the postcards because if I met the authors, these would be things I would not be privy to, but somehow in the anonymous world of the internet it is ok that I know. Reading Post Secret is like finding a terribly juicy diary, itching to read it, and without reservation, giving in.&lt;/p&gt;
