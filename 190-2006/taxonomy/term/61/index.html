    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://globalo.blogspot.com/">a blog i bet you all will appreciate</a></p>
<p>i was reading all of these amazing last-minute homestretch blogs, which are pretty awesome in general (thanks for all the links, lindsay) and somehow my neighbor heard what i was up to and recommended me to check out that global o site, seeing as how i was getting such a kick out of the internet. i thought the home website (globalorgasm.org) was pretty kickass, but the fact that there was a BLOG link got me way too excited - and reminded me of these lurking blogs that i need to complete... ah enough of that.</p>
<p>as i was seeking inspiration for a blog topic (slash surfing the net), i stumbled across MORE information about this horny manatee business. these underground flash phenomena really blow my mind -- especially how the internet can help encourage and support likeminded people into action. but i can't help but wonder to what end? like this global orgasm thing for example, more power to the movement (and i hope you all participate, and continue to take me somewhat seriously as a person...) hopefully it will make a positive peaceful difference in the world - oh tangent here, but has anyone seen "a constant gardener"? i just watched it and it was amazing and everything, but the realities of corruption were still hard for me to handle. and this movie had such a social consciousness and was still critically acclaimed, i hope it opened up some minds at least... -- and yeah, back to media making a difference, i like where this is going so i posted it for you all - but at the same time i also think it's hilarious. same with the manatee stuff, i know it was born from a conan skit but i mean over a million hits in a few days? thats hella popular, right? and the same with postsecret.blogspot.com - all of these websites have caught my attention in that they are crazy popular for the simple basic concepts shown on the web. i still can't wrap my head around it - and more importantly to me, how this can be converted into real actual change.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I just got back from the most entertaining conversation at dinner. Well, it was necessarily entertaining, but it really was thought-provoking and involved three members of our Seminar and one Philosophy major. It started when I referred to the person who will be living next door to me next semester as a "rando", short for "random person" since it was not by our design that he will be living there. This word was not my own invention, but it is one of my favorites and thus I use it as much as humanly possible. We then collectively realized that this is a trend in our contemporary culture - shortening words from their original forms, as in "poss" for "possibly"; "whatevs" for "whatever"; "sitch" for "situation"; "probs" for "probably"; and I have no idea how to even begin spelling the modification for "usual" but I'm pretty sure you know what it sounds like.</p>

He was also on an episode of the short-lived MTV dating show "Wanna Come In?" and he was in fact invited in. Here's the link:</p>

And my juggling. I really suck still. But that's what practice is for, right? Anyway. I wanted to share a clip that I love, and didn't think I'd have much to talk about, until I found a second clip. Please excuse my ineptitude with our blogging system, and my inability to post actual links, but please just copy and paste the urls to take a look at what I'm talking about in each case.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I thought y'all would find this interesting. Ghostwriter are both taking (were both taking :) ) Sociology of Popular Music and our final project was probably more applicable to this particular Senior Seminar class, since we tackled the issue of authorship.</p>
<p>Along with a Pitzer student who's a singer, the three of us decided to perform three different versions of the same song - Jose Gonzalez's "Crosses". I don't know if you all are familiar with the song, but it's a pretty good slow acoustic number. Really folky. So Ghostwriter did a slow, keyboard-based soulful ballad. I did an uptempo, punk-ish version on my acoustic guitar, and the Pitzer student, who is Latin-American, sang it poppier and included a verse in Spanish. We were looking at how the song's meanings and style were altered in the mind of the audience when singers with different ethnic backgrounds sang it in a style more closely associated with their ethnicity. It was a great song to choose for that project also because Gonzalez is Swedish, born of Argentinian parents, playing a style that isn't really associated with either of those countries - at least in "Crosses".</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Speaking of perusing Facebook, I don't know if any of you have come across this before, but there is an entire fake community created by Harvey Mudd kids of people from Guttlesohn Falls, Wisconsin. It's difficult to describe, but all the pictures are like old daguerrotypes from the 1800s and they've got ridiculous names like Thatcher Worthington Guttlesohn. They've created groups like the Guttlesohn Falls Rotary and the Guttlesohn Falls Hunting Club. It's an entire false reality that they've been able to realize through the virtual social networking tool that is Facebook. I definitely recommend that everyone go check this out, because they have been so diligent and thorough about it. I've thought about joining their community, since there are dozens of them, but for some reason it feels really wrong to try that. It seems like a well-defined space, but I know that anytime I want to I could join it and no one would know/be able to stop me. It's a really cool idea, and if any of you are involved, mad props to you.</p>

I don't know if you all have heard of this, because I just read about it, but this time last it had Warner Brothers getting a cease and desist order against the guy.

    <div class="content"><p>I just have a couple of things I've noticed in the reading that I want to expand upon briefly. First, is Siva's description of Diogenes, the Greek dude who he calls the first cynic, and says masturbated in the marketplace. He describes this man saying, "He engaged powerful people in playful debate, often exposing their hypocrisy" (25). Who does this sound like in our contemporary society? Why, none other than Sacha Baron Cohen. Through his many characters, including Ali G and Borat, he seems to be carrying on this cynical tradition (by Siva's definition). Every subsequent sentence describing the guy then sounds like it could be describing Ali G, and come on, if you heard that any celebrity had masturbated in the marketplace these days, wouldn't mind immediately jump to Baron Cohen. Hell, he sort of did it in the Borat movie. I just thought this was an interesting parallel.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, so I'm not really sure what point I'm going to make with this, but I feel that there is one, so I'm just going to type pretty much as fast as I can and see what comes out (other than typos). And if any of you can think of a good point to add to this, then please be my guests.</p>
<p>   Anyway, I was up in Petaluma, north of San Francisco over the Thanksgiving break, spending some time with my aunt. She's a screenwriter/story consultant, who just got out of a couple-year-long gig with a public access television station up there. She's trying to start up projects and whatnot and has decided that mySpace is the way to do it. Her being of my parents' generation, she is not as familiar with recent technological advances, and enlisted me as her mySpace tutor for an afternoon.</p>
