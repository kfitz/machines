<p>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6160414.stm</p>
<p>It's about Universal Music Group suing MySpace for encouraging copyright infringement. Wtf? Why would they waste their time with this? It seems to me like MySpace's case is pretty airtight, as they've done less to encourage law-breaking than almost any musically-oriented site since prior to Napster's inception. In fact, MySpace is nothing but good for music - the industry, the musicians, the art form. This is a terrible PR move and an unwinnable case. Seriously, if anyone can see why a record company would continue the litigation against this particular site, let me know.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Last night I went to see the film BABEL with some friends and first of all, I would recommend it to anyone with a spare $10 and a couple of hours of free time. The film is beautiful, with magnificent scenes from various continents and it is visually magnificent.  The music is wonderful and the cast is great (I've never really been a Brad Pitt fan before, but his short amount of screen time in this film is actually really good). I love Gael Garcia Bernal and was pleased with his performance, but saddened by his small amount of screen time. The cast as a whole is great, even the kids.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to discuss this type of movie. I'll try to not spoil it for those of you who want to see it.  The film is constructed like Crash.  The film has storylines that connect at the end, despite all the major characters being on different continents and living very different lives.  I find this very interesting in terms of the narrative. Jumping between all the plots leaves the audience in suspense about one plot, then creates suspense for them in the next one.  I love this style of filmmaking. Films that have a straight-forward, linear narrative often have scenes that are slow, or not as enticing and I often lose interest. This choppy, non-linear style keeps drawing the audience back into the film and with this film, the variety of characters and scenes is amazing. Offering this wide range is beneficial, as it gives a wide variety of scenes, a wonderful ensemble cast (much like Crash), and different aspects for audience members to relate to.  I find it very interesting that this type of film has gained such popularity and prestige.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was having a conversation a while back with my favorite Media Studies-hating friend while we were watching television. We saw one of those many commercials that have begun springing up in which a brief part of a story is told or something and then the commercials ends with an encouragement to go visit the website for more of the story. </p>
<p>His conclusion was that this was pretty stupid. He had never followed those directions and was kind of offended that the company was making him do more of their work. If they wanted to advertise to him, they should do it on their time, not on his. Going to their website would just mean buying into their whole marketing scheme.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Okay, so I'm sure that someone has written about Borat, but I can't find it to attach this to their blog, but I'm going to tie it in with Parental Control, so I figure I'll probably say something slightly new to the blog.</p>
<p>   I'm sure that many of you have seen the Borat movie, but I'll still try not to give anything away. And I hope that many of you have seen Parental Control, because after Yo Momma it is the best reality show on television. For those of you who are unfamiliar with its genius, the plot is that there are two parents who are ridiculously unhappy with their son or daughter's significant other. So they interview a slew of willing candidates, choose two of them and then sit at home with the unhappy significant other, watching the son or daughter go on televised dates with the new candidates. After the two dates, the son or daughter has to choose between staying with his or her current significant other or taking one of the new candidates. The show makes me feel ridiculously trashy sometimes, but I can't help loving it. Sometimes I'll even skip meals to stay home and watch it on MTV. I often think to myself, "Why do you like this show?" I think it's because I'm convinced it's not actually real.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>OK, so someone blogged about last week's episode of South Park and Cartman's anticipation of the new Nintendo Wii being released.  Well, South Park is amazing and I wanted to put something out there that was in that episode that everyone should know about. Some of you have probably heard about this already, but for those of you who haven't... it's pretty interesting.<br />
So in the episode, Mrs. Garrison is instructed to teach the class about evolution and has an issue teaching it to her students. Basically, there is a reference to believing in a Flying Spaghetti Monster as god.  This is not just a random South Park comment.  The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists and it is actually quite popular.  Followers of the religion are called Pastafarians. A man named Bobby Henderson had an issue with a Kansas school district teaching the theory of Intelligent Design as well as evolution and wrote a letter to the school board about teaching all the various theories of Intelligent Design if they were going to teach any. He goes on to explain his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and how it should be taught in school. He explains that the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the Earth and placed all the evidence of evolution here. It was actually very detailed and included everything from diagrams to a graph explaining that the reason we have global warming is the due to the decrease in the number of pirates in the world since the 1800's.  Anyway, you can read the open letter at this site:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Basically, I went on the Price is Right today and I need to blog more, so I am going to write about the experience and connect it to authorship. First of all, ridiculous people go on the Price is Right.  It was amazing... people from Florida with shirts that said "My Gator is Neutered" are a prime example.  Anyway, I went on the show with my rugby team (and a few friends of ruggers) and a girl on the team was picked (Angie Martinez, she goes to Pitzer).<br />
It got me thinking... I was reminded of our discussion of Authorship and Film because I got to see so many elements of the show happening, such as the cameras and all the crew running around to make sure everything was right.  It allowed me to see how many people really are involved in the process.  And also it got me thinking about the formulaic narratives we have been discussing with Hamlet on the Holodeck and First Person.  The Price is Right follows such a formula, it's almost ridiculous.  However, the audience plays a role in the outcome of the show and plays an important part in the show environment.  The contestants are picked from the audience and typically the members of the audience are frequent viewers, so the viewer is somewhat involved in the outcome of the show.  And while the producers pick who those selected audience members are, the audience is still involved in creating the atmosphere and helping the game players choose prices.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So for the presentation, if you get a chance, take a look at "What Does a Very Large-Scale Conversation Look Like?" by Warren Sack. It's related to the Vesna article and is kind of weird. One thing that struck me in these two chapters that I think people should think about for the presentation tomorrow is the distance between academia and real people. This is a major problem I have with much of academia that gets too wrapped up in the theoretical and ignores what real people are doing or thinking. Thinking back on our previous readings, I was okay with the Foucault, Barthes articles because they were being academics wrapped up in academic subjects.</p>
