 <title>questions for the man....ovich</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/409</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For the time being, I will write out the questions I had for one Lev Manovich in response to &quot;The Forms&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 215, Manovich writes that within computer culture &quot;the user navigates through a virtual space both to work and play, whether analyzing scientific data or killing enemies in Quake&quot;. While I can understand the main point behind this, my first reaction was -- that doesn&#039;t exactly add up. In games, there is a created &quot;world&quot; and sphere that is virtual and navigable -- with databases and scientific information, I get the vibe that there is not so much of a difference between the virtual experience and the real experience of looking at pure information. I&#039;d think the graphs tables and such would be just on a screen as opposed to within a book -- and while that is indeed different in many wanys, it didn&#039;t seem so comparable to computer game worlds, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
