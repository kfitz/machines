 <description>&lt;p&gt;I did really enjoy the film, but I&#039;m going to talk about what I didn&#039;t like here. (Isn&#039;t that what we Pomona students do??)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as Mosley wanted to show that things are not black and white I think he did really set it up for Ãlvarez to win for councilman. Throughout the beginning it seemed he was made to look like the innocent, down to earth, good hearted simple man. Lucinda, on the other hand was shown as ruthless, aggressive, and far less moral than her competitor. We see her in the bus with her campaign manager and although we get a glimpse into her idealistic past we also see her do nothing as the campaign manager throws out the other girl for not wanting to lie! When Ãlvarez won, it came as no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
