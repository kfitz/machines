 <description>&lt;p&gt;yo. so i&#039;ve been taking a screenwriting class, and it&#039;s the first creative writing class i&#039;ve ever really taken, so it&#039;s the first time in college where i&#039;ve been creaing my own work. though, like all of you, as the liberal arts college student i am, i&#039;ve written volumes, none of this really seemed to be like my own work, cuz it&#039;s all based on researching something else, it&#039;s all done in a framework of a class, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;throughout the class, we&#039;re supposed to have written a feature length screenplay (80-120 pages). being in this class, while being in senior seminar at the same time has been interesting, since we&#039;ve been examining deeply what it means to be an author, etc.  and now i&#039;m trying it out. I just turned it in today and i&#039;m thinking about the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
