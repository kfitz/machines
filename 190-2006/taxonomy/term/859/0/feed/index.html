 <title>Blog Blahbla</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/712</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;well time is now running out on Wednesday, December  13th, and this will be my last blog entry for this course. I think there&#039;s a good chance that this will be my last blog ever.&lt;br /&gt;
The experience of keeping a blog is one that I&#039;m glad I had, but I didn&#039;t really take full advantage of it. This can really be a great outlet for thoughts and ideas, and thoughts, and other things that happen in brains. Mostly I looked at the blog as a chore throughout the semester, but it should have been more than that. This blog could have been the greatest blog in all the land. Fables could have been written about this blog. This blog could have been the stuff of legend.&lt;/p&gt;
