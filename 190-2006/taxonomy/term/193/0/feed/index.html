 <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember Poe, that woman who was kind of a hit for 5 minutes in the mid-90&#039;s?  She sang that &quot;Angry Johnny&quot; song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did anyone else notice the little Poe blurb on the back of House of Leaves?  It says: &quot;listen to the house. . . &quot;HAUNTED&quot; The new cd from Poe on Atlantic Records&quot;.  I&#039;d seen this a number of times before I really started thinking about how strange it is for a book like House of Leaves to have a cross-media product blurb on its back cover.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I realized that the text on the top of page 89 (&quot;&#039;pinch it&#039;, she said, which I did, lightly, until she also said &#039;pull it&#039; which I also did, gently...&quot;), which I&#039;d thought had been recited in a Jewel song (that would&#039;ve been even weirder) was actually recited in the beginning of a Poe song (Hey Pretty).  Okay, so there&#039;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
