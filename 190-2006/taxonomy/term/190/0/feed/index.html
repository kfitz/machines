 <title>reality tv ethics</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/177</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my friend today and she told me about a reality TV show she had heard of in England that was set up like the Bachelorette.  The twist was the girl these guys were dating used to be a man (unknown to the contestants).  I googled it and couldn&#039;t find this show, so I am not sure if this premise is entirely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This however made me think about the ethics of reality television.  If psychologists have to submit experimental designs to ethics committees to ensure minimal physical or psychological damage there is no reason reality TV shouldn&#039;t face these same restrictions.  Psychology is in the name of science but an experiment in which heavy amounts of psychological stress was induced by deception, would never fly.  In reality television I feel they push the boundaries, trying to find more ways to push there contestants in the name of entertainment.  In other countries for example Big Brother is a huge success, I have heard stories of people giving birth in the house, people going nearly crazy in the house, people being manipulated by the producers and forced (slightly) to do things they clearly don&#039;t want to do, est..  Yes, these people agree before hand to do whatever the producers throw at them, but there is a lot of pressure involved.&lt;/p&gt;
