 <title>Brangelina loves Banksy...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;and so do a lot of other celebs who attended the &quot;Barely Legal&quot; show (Keanu, Jude Law, McCauley Culkin, Xtina).&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately I didn&#039;t make it to the show so I can&#039;t comment directly, but evidently and according to LA weekly writer Linda Immediato, the audience took an ironic turn for the worse. In addition to the high star power, there were a bunch of &quot;well-dressed sorts in expensive clothing... a handful of miscreant graffiti kids, a few tattoed rabble rousers, but by and large the crowd was college-educated gorgeous. Everywhere I turned, my ears were flooded with people praising the show: &#039;brilliant,&#039; &#039;amazing,&#039; &#039;genius,&#039; blah blah blah, &#039;important.&#039;&quot;  She thought she was in the wrong place. The scene she depicts makes my stomach turn even in print. And I know it&#039;s lame to let art be affected by the other people who like it, but I (and Linda, evidently) am affected. the simple fact that some idiot likes the same thing I might enjoy makes me have disdain for it. anyway, back to banksy. what&#039;s interesting to me is that (assuming Linda wasn&#039;t the only one with this response) is that the composition of the audience affected the actual art... It seems that Banksy&#039;s intent (whatever revolutionary social change it might be) was overshadowed or even subverted by the overwhelming prescence and acceptance of those &quot;college-educated gorgeous.&quot;  In the end, Immediato makes the genius comparison between the exhibition&#039;s reception and &quot;the Banksy sketch of people lined up to buy T-shirts that read &#039;destroy capitalism.&#039;&quot;  So maybe this is the kind of hypocritical scene Banksy craves - mainstream richies hobnobbing and talking about how &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;important&quot; doctoring up Paris Hilton CDs was, and all the while gawking at Christina Aguilera. Gotta love the irony.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Banksy matters.</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/89</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Living in LA is both a curse and a blessing. The smog, Hummers, lack of public transportation, etc... make me want to leave. But, living here means that I get to see loads of cultural productions that I wouldn&#039;t normally get to see at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city I live, frankfurt, has a nice graffiti scene; its not really up to par with berlin or hamburg, but I do get to see great pieces every time I drive under a bridge or when waking through the city. This summer, I visited my brother in London to help him move out of his flat. I had already known about Banksy (my brother bought me his book Wall and Piece last christmas) and I was really excited to be able to see his pieces where they are meant to be seen - in public space.&lt;/p&gt;
