 <title>I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m going to say this where people can read it</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;but I&#039;m 8 post short....so...you know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my girlfriend got &lt;em&gt;D.E.B.S&lt;/em&gt; for us on Netflix, in that, &quot;hey come on, I know it will be bad, but it could be fun, right?&quot; sort of way and I was completely like &quot;Oh my god, we can not watch this, like, fo&#039;reals&quot; but she prevailed, as often happens and we watched the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? It wasn&#039;t actually horrible.&lt;br /&gt;
I mean it is in no way a &quot;good movie&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s a piece of crap, the sound quality is bad and the plot is laughable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two things save it:&lt;br /&gt;
1) It doesn&#039;t take itself seriously and you can tell,&lt;br /&gt;
which is all important for bad movies. If they know they&#039;re bad and revel in their badness you can kinda be like &quot;ok, I&#039;ll go there with you&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
2) No one got reclaimed as a heterosexual,&lt;br /&gt;
which has got to be probably my biggest pet peeve with any movie that even flirts with queer content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who thinks they might actually see the movie *snort* and doesn&#039;t want me to ruin it, stop reading, for those who are as morbidly fascinated as I was, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A lesbian RomCom that doesn&#039;t suck more than your average RomCom...rock on!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/422</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Having realized just how little downtime I&#039;d been giving myself and the fact that I&#039;d been neglecting my girlfriend horribly, I decided to do something I hadn&#039;t done in a long time, watch a movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got &lt;em&gt;Imagine Me &amp;amp; You&lt;/em&gt; through Netflix, and I was skeptical. The Netflix description said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;In this delightful romantic comedy that gives new meaning to the term cold feet , bride-to-be Rachel (Piper Perabo) is love-struck ... but not with her groom. Instead, as she&#039;s marching down the aisle with her longtime sweetheart, Heck (Matthew Goode), Rachel is immediately bewitched by a beautiful guest (Lena Headey). Now, the newlywed must choose between the safety of a familiar relationship and her heart&#039;s true desire.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a lot in the description and I wasn&#039;t sure if it was going to be bad or &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad, but the girlfriend had put it on the queue so I figured we&#039;d watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be pretty good, considering it was a romantic comedy (a genre I do not have the highest esteem for). It managed to avoid most, if not all, of the major pitfalls of any movie focused around a lesbian relationship. &lt;strong&gt;(warning spoilers below, if you actually think you&#039;ll ever watch the movie and don&#039;t want me to spoil the ending, stop reading now!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
