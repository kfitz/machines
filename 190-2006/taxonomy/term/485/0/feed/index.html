 <title>It&#039;s been real</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody, just wanted to say goodbye with one last blog. All the smiles, the comments, the YouTube videos, I&#039;ll never forget them. In closing, I wanted to ask you all, why did you pick your blog name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;He&#039;s a ghost, and he writes to us,&quot; or &quot;How I picked my blog name&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, &quot;ghostwriter&quot; was inspired by my roommate&#039;s and my love for early 90s board games. Sitting on the shelf near my computer along with &quot;The Babysitters Club Game&quot; and &quot;Tamagotchi: The Game&quot; (yes, &quot;Tamagotchi&quot; exists as a board game), is the &quot;Ghostwriter Mystery Game&quot;. For those of you who don&#039;t know, &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; was an awesome PBS show in the early - mid 90s. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jRPRs1jiKE&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; will explain everything. Anyway, I really liked this name because you get the 90s TV show reference and the reference to questions about authorship posed by the actual practice of ghostwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s in a Name?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/438</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was perusing the internet looking for things to blog about when I came across this weird article on cnn.com. Apparently, a man from a small town in Wisconsin was running for Sheriff and losing horribly. So rather than accept defeat, he legally changed his name to Andy Griffith. He claims it has nothing to do with the actor Andy Griffith or wanting to capitalize on the name to gain more votes for himself. Sorry guy, I&#039;m not buying that. So now, the real Andy Griffith is suing the guy for violation of trademark and copyright laws. I feel bad for the guy, I mean, he lost went through the trouble of changing his name, but still lost the election &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is now being sued. Sucks to be him, but this story does raise some interesting questions. With the increase in file sharing, copyrights are becoming a bigger and bigger issue. It&#039;s interesting to see this copyright paranoia carry over into something like a person&#039;s name. When does a name become more than just a name? When does it cross over into the realm of commodity?&lt;/p&gt;
