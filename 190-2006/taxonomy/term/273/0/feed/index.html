 <description>&lt;p&gt;When we have discussed filmmakers and directors as authors, we&#039;ve mostly talked about the role of cinematographers or writers or producers, but somehow avoided discussing the role of actors in the authorship of a film. True, they are mostly pretty, vapid, blank slates for the director to carve into his vision. Paul Walker- definitely not an author. But in some cases, they have a huge impact on the text. I was reading an old article I clipped out of the LA Times about Andrew Bujalski&#039;s new film &quot;Mutual Appreciation.&quot; I had pulled it because of one quote about his characters, where he said that they &quot;get reconsidered retroactively through the prism of whoever I asked to play them.&quot; We forget that actors often rewrite their characters, and certainly they at least &quot;write&quot; the character with their own specific mannersims and what they bring to the role.&lt;/p&gt;
