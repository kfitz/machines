 <title>that reminds me</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/649</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The attorney general in Virginia just proposed making sex offenders register their screen names and e-mail addresses. Let me remind you just how hard Virginia sucks: they&#039;re the only state in the union that still flies in the face of Lawrence v. Texas, defining sodomy as a felony, a Crime Against Nature (I&#039;m not kidding), punishable by 5 years in prison. Adultery, co-habitation and consensual beastiality are also illegal, among other things. Why? The Bible, obviously. Cool, huh?&lt;br /&gt;
	This sort of reminds me of something awful that happened last semester. This 19-year-old kid in Georgia got 10 years in prison for consensual oral sex with a 17-year-old. The best part is, he&#039;d be out by now if they&#039;d just had vaginal sex. Great, huh? Life sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>poor pedophiles</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/648</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So there&#039;s this group of pedophile hunters called Perverted Justice who must be kidding me. They pose as little kids on the internet and invite peds to come over and have sex with them, then nab them on TV. These guys are idiots. Louis &quot;Bill&quot; Conradt Jr. was targeted by Perverted Justice, and killed himself. Tons of other poor peds have been ruined by these vigilantes. Why not let people do what they want? The whole premise here is sex between consenting parties, right? Why do pedophiles have no rights? For that matter, what of the rights of the kids to you know, associate freely? It&#039;s sort of funny. Those poor guys.&lt;/p&gt;
