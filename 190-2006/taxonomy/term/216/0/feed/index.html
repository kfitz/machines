 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wish there was more of a clear cut path as to what I am meant to do in applying for media type jobs.  All of my friends who are in the process of applying for consulting jobs have such an advantage in that the school caters to their needs.  If applying to a job I was interested in meant following a specific predetermined formulaic process I wouldn&#039;t have so much pent up anxiety about the fact that it is senior year and the impending graduation is approaching.&lt;br /&gt;
I want to look for work in children&#039;s television and perhaps in advertising but it is just a little disheartening to be surrounded by friends who are perusing more predictable paths.  I.E. they know what they  want to do next year, could tell me their starting salary, and could predict an average day. A lot of my finance friends already have job offers and they had an internship last summer which showed them exactly what working for their company will be like.  I feel like my internship in television didn&#039;t really provide me with the best picture of what salaried work would be like.  It got me into the environment, but my tasks were very intern specific.  I am sitting here going well likely if I pursue children&#039;s television I will start out as a PA, get frustrated and disillusioned and wind up back in gradschool to pend the inevitable second attempt at trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.  Has anyone found a way of getting around this feeling of uncertainty as to how to proceed about media job searches.&lt;/p&gt;
