 <title>x-mas</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/507</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Right before I sat down to write this I watched an episode of sex and the city.  I just found myself wanted to start writing Carrie style.  Something like beginning my bolg with some kind of clichÃ© metaphor, oh Carrie you have taught me so much.&lt;br /&gt;
	So, I have been thinking that this year Christmas came even earlier than usual in terms of store displays and commercials ect.  I think Starbucks busted out the x-mas stuff right around the end of Halloween.  This leaves me feeling sorry for thanksgiving.  It is being super out shadowed, the poor less consumer driven holiday.  I went to the village a few days before thanksgiving because I went to a friends house for the Thanks and wanted to get a gift.  Christmas Christmas everywhere.  No turkey gifts at all!  Even at the candy store there was x-mas candies everywhere and only a small shelf for the thanks.  And this is only in the village, anti-cooperate central.  I am sure at target it is a Christian winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
