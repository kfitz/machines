 <title>I just saw a guy pushing his dogs in a stroller</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/558</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;And that has nothing to do with this blog post - I am just still in awe. I mean two fat pugs in a baby stroller being pushed by their owner - what did they need some fresh air? and why can&#039;t they walk? Seriously. What a silly thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m understanding a ton of the concepts in this book since I&#039;m not familiar with all the references/don&#039;t have time to read slowly/have been skipping around a lot. The section that interested me most was the one about the ideology behind peer to peer, especially the last section &quot;anarchy of access versus the stability of ownership.&quot; Vaidhyanathan talks about the way in which peer-to-peer technology &quot;encourages both &#039;inconspicuous consumption&#039; and &#039;conspicuous production.&#039;&quot; It&#039;s a big potential function in a society in which conspicuous consumption dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
