 <title>global impact of the digital age</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/330</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During this class, we&#039;ve talked about the future implications of digital technology. One aspect that interested me a lot is how it makes the world more globally connected. for instances, on websites like YouTube or Wikipedia, people from all over the world can post. However, this technology is not impacting people all over equally. While this technology may amaze me and impact the way I view things, for many people in the world their lives are barely touched by it, at least in a direct way. When I think of the revolutionizing innovations that Murray theorized about, I can&#039;t help but think that that revolution would be pretty localized. Though this technology may have the capacity to enable global connections and create equal access to information, the technology itself is not yet widespread enough throughout the world. For example, where I went for study abroad, internet was pretty limited, and only available at internet cafes, with modem connections. if you were in a large city and wanted to pay 5x the normal price, maybe you could get DSL (but that&#039;s pushing it). Something like YouTube would have little impact, since it would be impossibly long to load the page. Also, the price of tape players were pretty expensive, let alone imagining the price of a digital camera or camcorder, which is what many people use for their video postings.&lt;/p&gt;
