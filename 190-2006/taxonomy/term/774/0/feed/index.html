 <title>thanksgiving DMCA exceptions</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/654</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys. You may remember the presentation on Anarchist in the Library, when KFitz told us about the six new exceptions to the DMCA prohibition against breaking copy protection.&lt;br /&gt;
	The first rule just says that media studies folks can do whatever we want (what we&#039;ve been doing all along). The second and third are just about using and archiving old software by bypassing the various hurdles imposed by natural hardware obsolescence. The fifth one is also boring (it&#039;s about installing firmware on cell phones), but the fourth and sixth are just plain awesome.&lt;br /&gt;
	The fourth rule is about ebooks. You guys remember that Russian guy who was arrested basically by Adobe and held for several months for writing software to enable blind people to read ebooks? Anarchist mentions him. It&#039;s so ridiculous. It&#039;s like arresting Mother Theresa. Actually, Mother Theresa was kind of a jerk. She baptized a lot of people without their consent. But hey, I guess most Catholics (I can&#039;t speak for all Christian demonimations) are baptized without their consent. Damn it. Life sucks. Anyway, the point is that this guy was really cool, and he got screwed by the DMCA. Anyway, this exception basically says that he was right.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>DMCA sucks hard</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/647</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just reading eff.org about the various offenses committed by our government against decency and good taste when I stumbled across this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_11.php#005030&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Apparently, the DMCA allows companies to subpoena each other for the identities of any anonymous internet people they don&#039;t like, without even filing a lawsuit or having any legitimate reason. We&#039;re just bypassing the entire legal system. Cool.&lt;br /&gt;
	It&#039;s just another case of awarding every single right to property owners at the expense of everyone else. Class warfare, man. Typical. Let&#039;s kill ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
