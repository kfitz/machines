 <title>Oh No You Didn&#039;t, Budget Travel</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/498</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My family has gotten Budget Travel magazine for a few years, and I&#039;ve always looked forward to reading it while being home on vacations from school.  This semester, however, my mom included an old issue in a box of brownies she sent me (I know, I know, you&#039;re jealous, but there are leftovers, so come over!) and I just got finished reading it cover to cover (something which I obviously don&#039;t have time to be doing).  I noticed something interesting: apart from a worker at La Super-Rica Taqueria (a recommended stop on driving the Pacific Coast Highway, in case you were wondering), there were absolutely no people of color featured in the editorial content of the magazine.  None.&lt;/p&gt;
