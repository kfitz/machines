 <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing my thesis chapter on South Africa, and I&#039;m not sure what it was, maybe the fact that I&#039;ve never been to South Africa to see a real SA&#039;n play, or never spoken face to face with someone who lived in SA during apartheid, but I just felt like I was writing a research paper.  Everything I wrote was taken directly from another source, and primary sources (either scripts or films) are pretty hard to come by.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, our theses are supposed to be cumulative expressions of what we&#039;ve learned, our most passionate arguement about our the issue we care most deeply about.  Anything I strive to prove about South Africa only applies to South Africa.  I can always say there are parallels with other regions, but without going into it in depth, it&#039;s just words.&lt;/p&gt;
