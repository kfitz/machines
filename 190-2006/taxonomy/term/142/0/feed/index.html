 <title>Cell phones = cultural experiance? (In which I am less longwinded and well developed than usual, you do the math)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/485</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, as I was dilligently working away on thesis related stuff, a friend of mine decided that I needed a break. So she came over and brought her fiance and his friend. We were mostly playing video games and carrying on three conversations at once when my friend spotted my girlfriend&#039;s cell phone. It&#039;s one of those sleak, new &quot;music phones&quot;. My friend immediately began to exclaim over the phone&#039;s cuteness and coolness, etc. She asked if my girlfriend had downloaded any music, which she hadn&#039;t because she didn&#039;t know how. So my friend brought out her phone to show her. My friend&#039;s phone, which she was given by a well-off friend who trades her&#039;s in every few months, was one of those cell/camera/mp3 player phones that flips open to reveal a larger screen, speakers, and a full qwerty keyboard. My girlfriend and I excalimed over the &quot;sick&quot;ness of her phone and she proceeded to extoll it&#039;s failings. Next thing I know everyone in the room had their phones out. Martinez (friend of fiance) was attempting to bluetooth his Razr to my friend&#039;s Sidekick to give her his ringtones, my friend was demonstrating to my girlfriend how to download media onto her phone, and fiance and I were comiserating about the realitve lameness of our phones.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Further discussion of the Drink Cocaine campaign</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.190-2006/node/139</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this by saying that I think that our country&#039;s stance on the matter of illegal substances is terribly misguided, I think that DARE does a lot more damage than good, and that the FDA and DEA are clearly more interested in regulating private citizen&#039;s personal morality on the basis of a highly conservative, fundamentalist Christian-oriented, and over-all misinformed perception of the dissemination, use, and effects of most so-called &quot;narcotics&quot; and controlled substances than in the protection of the citizenry. The FDA is a powerhouse of hegemonic regulation of &quot;controlled substances&quot;, not only does it directly control what substances can and can not be legally sold and how and in what quantities, etc. but it also controls what sort of research can be done on controlled substances. You can&#039;t research their effects without obtaining the substance and you can not legally and ethically obtain it for a viable research experiment without going through the FDA, which categorically refuses to give clearance or supplies to any proposed research with the intent or potential to disprove the governmental and departmental stance on controlled substances. They not only control the substances but the knowledge that can be generated in regards to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*pant pant* My desultory diatribe on drug regulation in this country now out of the way, on to the matter of Cocaine: Energy Drink....&lt;/p&gt;
