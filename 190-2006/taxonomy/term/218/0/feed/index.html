 <title>House of Leaves is a Blair Witch Bite, kind of...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Godard quoting Brecht: &quot;All art is plagarism.&quot; He might be exaggerating a bit but, I think the best one-liners usually do that.&lt;br /&gt;
So, the first thing that came to mind when reading House of Leaves (HoL) was the fake/real movie aspect of it. Straight away, it made me think of the Blair Witch Project. I&#039;m sure some of you thought the same. Especially with the whole monster-you-never-see device playing a huge role in The Navidson Record.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#039;t really take the &quot;plagarism&quot; stand for much more of the book because it is so unique. Given, I am not the most well-read person but I have never flipped so much from one part of a book to another since I read a Choose Your Own Adventure book back in the day. I mean, thats the post-modern condition isn&#039;t it? everythings been said, painted, presented, photographed, projected already. Take what you got and get your bricolage on. Danielewski definately did.&lt;/p&gt;
