<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Assignment 
  1<br>
  Due Tuesday, September 19</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Length: 4-5 pages (with 
  1&quot; margins, in 12-point Times)</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your first writing assignment 
  requires you to do something that seems quite antithetical to the project I've 
  described for us this semester. I said on the first day of class (as you may 
  recall) that we were going to work together to escape the New Criticism's ahistorical 
  insistence on reading the text in a vacuum, and that instead we were going to 
  undertake a more New Historical or Cultural Studies mode of reading, in which 
  we would consider the text's place in an entire cultural scheme of representations, 
  and so we would consider, in the famous phrase, both &quot;the historicity of texts 
  and the textuality of history.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">And so we will. But in 
  this first assignment, I am going to ask you to perform a close textual analysis 
  -- our old friend, &quot;close reading&quot; -- of some particular aspect of 
  either <i>Sister Carrie</i> or <i>The House of Mirth.</i> There are several 
  things you need to consider as you begin this assignment: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. The tactics and strategies 
  of close reading. I assume you have all had practice in this critical method 
  by this point. If not, talk to me or one of your peers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. &quot;Some particular 
  aspect&quot; -- by which I mean that you need to formulate the question your 
  paper seeks to answer in such a manner that it can be reasonably explored in 
  the brief space you are permitted. &quot;Representations of Consumption in <i>Sister 
  Carrie&quot;</i> is thus probably not a good topic. &quot;Department Stores 
  as Feminized Spaces in <i>Sister Carrie&quot;</i> might be a bit better. Keep 
  your focus narrow. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Your paper MUST seek 
  to make some kind of argument about the text in question. &quot;The representations 
  of consumption in <i>Sister Carrie</i> reveal the novelist's concern about the 
  expansion of capitalism&quot; is not an especially compelling argument, as (a) 
  it doesn't tell us much, (b) it attempts to tell us what the writer was thinking, 
  which is always dubious, and (c) what it does manage to tell us, we already 
  know. &quot;<i>Sister Carrie</i>'s representations of consumption -- and particularly 
  consumption by women -- point to the changing roles of women in early twentieth-century 
  America, as they emerge from the home and develop financial power of their own&quot; 
  could be far more compelling. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">4. HOWEVER: note that that 
  second argument requires you to have at your disposal a certain amount of historical 
  knowledge. All claims you make in your paper, both textual and extra-textual, 
  must be supported. In other words, if you choose to make an argument that is 
  either theoretically or historically contextualized, you must make use of appropriate 
  secondary texts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">5. On the subject of secondary 
  texts: you may feel free to use them, whether critical, historical, or theoretical 
  in nature, but you are not required to, and you must make sure that they do 
  not get in the way of your original, compelling, tightly constructed argument. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Final notes: Your paper 
  must be typed or word-processed, must be handed in in hard copy, titled, double-spaced. 
  And it must use MLA format for citations. If you don't know MLA format, look 
  it up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I will happily look at 
  early drafts as soon as they're ready, but will not comment on any drafts received 
  after 10 a.m., Sunday, September 17. Drafts handed in after 2 p.m., Friday, 
  September 15 must be sent to me by e-mail. </font></p>
