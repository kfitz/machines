<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Assignment 
  2 <br>
  Due Thursday, October 19</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Length: 4-5 pages (with 
  1&quot; margins, in 12-point Times)</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;[The] historical 
  mode is grounded on the concepts that history itself is not a set of fixed, 
  objective facts but, like the literature with which it interacts, a text which 
  needs to be interpreted; that a text, whether literary or historical, is a discourse 
  which, although it may seem to present, or reflect, an external reality, in 
  fact consists of what are called representations Ñ that is, verbal formations 
  which are the 'ideological products' or 'cultural constructs' of a particular 
  era; and that these cultural and ideological representations in texts serve 
  mainly to reproduce, confirm, and propagate the power-structures of domination 
  and subordination which characterize a given society&quot; (Abrams 249). </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your second assignment 
  is to write a paper which performs a careful, comparative cultural analysis 
  of TWO of the texts we have read so far this semester. You may select <i>Sister 
  Carrie</i> or <i>The House of Mirth</i> to be one of those texts; however, you 
  may not select the same text you wrote about in your first paper. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This assignment will require 
  you to formulate a very specific argument about the differing ways in which 
  two of our texts depict some aspect of changing, modernizing American culture. 
  This argument must, as always, be supported by very careful textual analysis. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The goal of this paper, 
  as opposed to the first paper you wrote, is to examine the two texts you select 
  as representations of modern American culture. This paper should not isolate 
  the text from its cultural and historical background, but should in fact engage 
  that background. This may require some research on your part. Use your discretion. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus, the assignment takes 
  the following as its assumptions: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. You must make a very 
  specific argument about the relationships of the two texts you select. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. This argument must be 
  cultural or historical in nature, rather than strictly textual. If you don't 
  get the distinction I'm making here, re-read the excerpt from M. H. Abrams's 
  <i>Glossary of Literary Terms</i> that I gave you on the first day of class. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Your argument must be 
  supported by a careful close reading of the texts you select. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you need examples of 
  this kind of critical work, check the MLA Bibliography (available over Honnold's 
  web server) for recent articles published on topics that seem similar to yours. 
  Read these articles carefully, not just for their content, but also for their 
  form. And remember Ñ if you borrow anything from an article you read, you must 
  cite it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Final notes: Your paper 
  must be typed or word-processed, must be handed in in hard copy, titled, double-spaced. 
  It must use MLA format. And please proofread it carefully before handing it 
  in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I will happily look at 
  early drafts as soon as they're ready, but will not comment on any drafts received 
  after 5 p.m., Monday, October 16. Drafts handed in after 1 p.m., Friday, October 
  13 must be sent to me by e-mail. </font></p>
