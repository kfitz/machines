  Description</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This course will focus 
  on an admittedly slippery genre, one that has only in recent years been taken 
  seriously as a subject for critical discourse: science fiction. We will approach 
  science fiction from a number of complimentary perspectives. On the one hand, 
  we will consider the argument forwarded by one critic that science fiction is 
  characterized by &quot;cognitive estrangement,&quot; by creating new worlds 
  that we must struggle to understand. At the same time, we will bear in mind 
  the critical suggestion that such &quot;other worlds&quot; narratives are always 
  about our world, and that tales of the future are invariably about the present. 
  In so doing, we'll begin with a series of texts that construct what might be 
  thought of as the contemporary science fiction &quot;tradition,&quot; and will 
  follow these with a number of texts that, in varying ways, write back to or 
  against that tradition. Throughout, our focus will be on these writers' widely 
  varying treatments of race and gender, both as part of worlds from which we 
  are &quot;cognitively estranged,&quot; and as part of worlds that tell us something 
  about our own.</font> </p>
