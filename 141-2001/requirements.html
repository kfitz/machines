<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Course 
  Requirements and Grading</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Attendance and Participation:</b> 
  As our work here will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness 
  are indispensable, and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; 
  each additional unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. Moreover, 
  chronic late arrivals will not be tolerated; for every three late arrivals, 
  one unexcused absence will accrue. Attendance at the screenings is likewise 
  required; if you have a conflict, it is your responsibility to ensure that you 
  see the film. Factored into your A&P grade will be required attendance at a 
  number of lectures and panel discussions in the &quot;Representations: Race/Tech-nology/Culture&quot; 
  series. Finally, be aware that presence without preparedness does not count. 
  Do the reading.<b> (15%) </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Readings and Responses:</b> 
  As you'll no doubt quickly note, there's a lot of reading in this class: twelve 
  novels, plus supplementary theoretical and critical essays. As you'll also quickly 
  figure out, most of the novels are very fast reads. While I may narrow your 
  focus in them at times, please note that the supplementary essays are not optional 
  reading; I'll expect each of you to be able to use them in your discussion of 
  the novels. You will be required to post at least one reading response for each 
  novel on Web Crossings. I'm going to start off those discussions, but I hope 
  they'll remain pretty free-form Ñ use this space to get down those middle-of-the-night 
  flashes of inspiration that we might miss otherwise. (The grade for this will 
  be factored into your participation grade; thus, you may balance too little 
  talking in class with more posting, and vice versa. Being very talkative in 
  class, however, does not absolve you of Web Crossings responsibilities.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Class Facilitation:</b> 
  Early in the semester, I will divide the class into discussion groups. Each 
  group will be responsible for taking the lead in class discussion, on a rotating 
  basis. Each group will facilitate our discussion by giving a brief presentation 
  and by preparing questions and topics that actively guide our exploration of 
  the material. More details to follow. <b>(15% total)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Papers:</b> During the 
  semester, you will produce two 5-page papers in which you will perform a close 
  reading of any element of a particular group of texts. These papers may later 
  serve as the jumping-off point for your term paper, or you may abandon these 
  topics altogether and work on something new. The term paper, due at the end 
  of the semester, will be 15 pages long, will involve substantial research, and 
  will make a complex, well-defined argument. You will submit a proposal and an 
  annotated bibliography for this paper several weeks in advance of the paper 
  itself; shortly before the paper itself is due, you will submit a draft to a 
  peer reviewer. All papers must use proper MLA format. Late papers will only 
  be accepted by prior arrangement. Again, more details to follow. <b>(brief papers, 
  15% each; term paper, 40%)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>*Alternate to Paper 
  Requirements:</b> In the past, this class has had a mandatory web component, 
  in which, rather than writing traditional scholarly papers, students were asked 
  to use the technologies of the web to effectuate the same kind of work. In this 
  class, the web component is not required, but I will allow any student who wishes 
  to do that variety of critical work to do so. I will ask you to commit yourself 
  to this web-based approach fairly early in the semester, so please take a look 
  at the kinds of projects that have been done in the past, to see if this is 
  an avenue you would like to explore (http://www.english.pomona.edu/pomo). One 
  note about this possibility: please don't fool yourself into thinking that this 
  is an easy way to get out of doing rigorous critical writing. On the contrary; 
  with the web assignments, I require both rigorous critical work and technical 
  proficiency, so these projects are more work rather than less. That having been 
  said, they are often more rewarding. Please see me soon if you are interested 
  in pursuing a web project. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>N.B.:</b> There are 
  currently no quizzes or exams scheduled for this class. I reserve the right 
  to change my mind about this, however, if I feel an insufficient number of people 
  are completing the readings each week. Do your friends a favor: do the reading, 
  talk in class, and avoid a nasty final. </font></p>
