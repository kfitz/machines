</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>as i've said before, i really like all the content up there (that was also on the wiki). i also like the skeleton you've put in place for the rest of it. where do you think the map will fit in? how present will it be? one extreme: it's on every page, along with a dot that tells you where you are. the other extreme: it's on only one page, and although it links out to all the pages, it's hard to get to. i imagine getting the map up there in the first place must be tough.</p>
<p>you should also think about the format. on the pages where you have text, it's mostly in a wide chunk at the top of the page. i'm struggling with this myself. there are definitely cooler ways to lay it out, but i haven't found any i like yet. let me know what you end up coming up with.</p>
<p>i'll tell you the same thing i told becca: watch out for pages with no links out of them. i realize you're not done yet, but, with so many pages, i think it'd be really easy to let a few slip by. of course, dead ends might be part of your plan, just as dead ends are part of the quetico chains (if you take a wrong turn). just keep in mind that they're a little annoying to deal with, if there are a lot of them, and it's a sign (independent of its accuracy) that you weren't very careful putting the hypertext together. it's assumed that hypertexts shouldn't have dead ends, i think. i don't remember any in any of the ones we read.</p>
<p>i don't know how else i can help out. one thing i can do is point out typos. there're a couple of typos on the <a href="http://pages.pomona.edu/~sb002004/Dire%20Wolf.html">dire wolf</a> page.</p>
<p>i don't know, but i've been told, if the horse don't pull you got to carry the load</p>

    <div class="content"><p>you definitely have had the clearest vision out of any of us for your project from the very beginning, and it still shows in how you've managed to map out what gnugnu calls the 'skeleton' of your hypertext.  i wish more of your content was already published to the site you emailed us so i could see how it fits together.  like me, you're probably scrambling to link content for the quickly approaching deadline...</p>
<p>as i said, your idea has been a very strong one from the beginning.  the only thing that's lacking for me is what i would imagine to be the real alive lushness of the wilderness you're describing.  i don't mean you should attempt to recreate wilderness somehow on the internet; obviously that's not really possible.  but i feel like i could be in the project more-- an explorer of the hypertext trying to uncover information about the chains i visit but also have an understanding of where the individual lakes/straights/narrows fit into the overall "mess of names."  gnugnu commented about the map above, and i think it is a pivotal part of your project.  unlike most other hypertexts whose maps are just representations of a "path" through the text, your map is both metaphorical and physical (if you were to use it to navigate the system of lakes).  if you don't want to include the map on every page, perhaps you could have certain "checkpoint" pages where you allow the reader to "consult the map."</p>
<p>i also love the opening aerial photograph of the Quetico chain... it's very orienting.  i wish it were larger and there were some way i could go down into it to begin your story.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Like everybody else has said, your project definitely has the best linking structure.  The map is fabulously intricate and actually makes you feel like you are navigating.  It will also be much more interesting to navigate once the map is linked to every page because then, in addition to the linear directions, there is the possibility for less word navigation and more pictorial navigation.</p>
<p>This project is daunting to say the least and I can't imagine how you're going to finish your content on each of the pages that you've set up so far.  </p>
<p>Although content and the limking structure should definitely come first, you might want to think about how to make your a little more aesthetically pleasing.  I know this is coming from someone whose entire project is about aesthetics, but I think there could be more to yours than a white page with text.  Just something to think about.</p>
<p>The map though, it's sweet. Nice job.</p>
