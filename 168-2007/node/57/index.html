    <div class="content"><p>Does Trip always cheeat on Grace, or just in some versions?  Regardless, I agree with you about the dialog not affecting the story very much.  They rarely reacted to what I said and I was actually saying real things.  I asked, "Grace, do you love Trip," and she got offended because she thought I was suggesting that she didn't love him.  So even when they did react to things I said, it felt like they couldn't understand the grammar.  Also, sometimes I couldn't get a word in edgewise.  Do you have to be looking at one of them for them to understand your statement?  Trip also thought I was coming on to Grace (I seriously don't know how that happened) and the whole time they were both mad at me for being there.  There also wasn't enough room for writing.  I think there are only 20 available spaces, which is not enough to save a relationship.  I wasn't satisfied with the interface, but their arguments were fun to listen to and relatively realistic.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by stumpy on 27 October 2007 - 11:05am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I completely forgot about my seventh grade obsession with the Sims.  All my friends had it, so of course I had to have it too.  I just played a little Sims to try and remember what it was like (because it reminded me of facade... or the other way around) and there are some interesting features I had totally forgotten about.  For example, in addition to making sure that your Sims pay their bills and go to the bathroom, you have to make sure their "fun level" is at a certain level.  If the fun level drops too low, the Sims become depressed (although I read somewhere that they can never commit suicide) and then they make the other Sims depressed.  This was the part that reminded me of facade.  The funny thing is, this is the bigggest danger in the game.  The Sims can't really get physically hurt.  Most video games deal with actions to evade physical danger, which is easier for the player to estimate.  How do I not get shot by my opponent?  a) shoot him back or b) dodge/hide.  Because emotions and reactions are so complicated, we are much more prone to be critical of games like facade and the Sims, which fail in their attempt to recreate such complex concepts like personality and emotions.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I played the sims a little obsessively for about a week before it got old for me. I do have a pretty good memory of it however. What's interesting to me is that the sims was an obvious quantification of human life, and much more addicting than facade which I think is more of a qualification of human life (or attempted at leas).<br />
What I mean is the sims you had obvious measuring sticks, ratings if you will. Your job, your material possessions, your attempts at love. ("tell joke, give compliment, tell joke, give compliment, tell joke, give compliment" all the while your relationship rating going up--if i remember the game properly) This at least for me was much more addicting than facade which is a muddle. In facade there is a very apparent disconnect between what you do and what happens. A lack of clarity of what you have power over. I saw this as a clear shortcoming of the AI to properly interact with you. But in comparison to the sims its a much more accurate representation of real life, where we have no idea what result our actions have as opposed to a sound effect and +3 above someones head or some garbage like that.</p>
<p>Now there is something very appealing about talking to real people and having pleasing/irritating sound effects play when they're digging you. This aside however no one really wants this, at least I don't think so. Thats why the sims gets old. no complexity. There is some sort of balance here where the is no clear answer to what is preferred. Look at  in terms of face book. What are friend counts and pokes on facebook but the sim-ulification (to drop some lexia to perplexia neologisms on this post) of life. (I wanted to say real life, but held back in respect of my media studies major)</p>
