</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>I will print this out to bring in today as well.</p>
<p>I want nothing more than for this to be torn to pieces so the most prominent logical flaws will be solved, and I am sure, as you will see, you'll find many. Enjoy........................</p>
<p>I am settled on my premise, which is unfortunate as it is entirely preposterous. However, I assert emphatically that we live in an increasingly preposterous world, and there is nothing I aspire to more in creative writing than emphatic preposterousness.<br />
Let me qualify this idea before I delineate the project. Never before have we been so mediated, so constructed in everything we do. In the western world we are the machine, or rapidly becoming so. I firmly believe that we are traversing the conflation of reality and fantasy of hyper-real into the cyber-real, or some other more appropriate neologism denoting a world of an inartificial fantasy as the only reality. This is not a value judgment, but simply a theoretical rendering of the presently evolving cyber world. Like most cyber-punk literature envision my story as a hopelessly optimistic dystopia.<br />
After my initial conception of a My Space based fiction I struggled with problems of implementation, all of whose solutions will play some role in the structure.<br />
My largest problem was one of interesting premise. When would a group of 6 or 7 people join MySpace all at the same time? I ran through a few scenarios that seemed occurred to immediately. A group that just finished a trip together and want to stay in touch. A group that met at a conference. A spontaneous orgy. Strangers in a bank held hostage for ransom.<br />
I found none of these had the innate themes I desired in a narrative. They were respectively: too boring (conference, trip? Yawn), too pornographically limiting (Any extrapolation on an orgy and I feel like I am going to get too much outside involvement), or too clichÃ©d (Hostage crisis screams Denzel Washington movie, which isn't something I want to play out on My Space). What I didn't realize at the time was what I was looking for was something certifiably insane.<br />
Then I had a lucky conversation. I had taken to asking friends in what situation they thought a small group of people would join my space almost simultaneously and begin interesting dialogue. This was a seemingly fruitless task. Either they had no interesting ideas or no interest in the subject. My friend Hannah went as far as derisively retorting, "6 or 7 people joining myspace simultaneously and having interesting discussion? I don't know that sounds like the apocalypse to me."<br />
â€¦Wait! The apocalypse, that's it! How delightfully ridiculous!</p>
<p>A super-virus has decimated the world population. The speed of contamination is immeasurable. Parents on doorsteps spend their last moments watching their children fall dead leaving for school. The virus functions as a social scourge. What is known is that it is omnipresent in the worlds air, but beyond that very little. At outbreak it seems have killed anyone in the presence of other people, and then after that spread malignantly. Media coverage established that before it ended altogether. It took only about 12 hours for the destruction of the vast majority of humanity. </p>
<p>Hypotheses abound among the few who survive. And they are few. They might be intensely secluded in mountaintops, or residents of North Dakota. They might have conveniently been researching in sealed sterile environments. Perhaps they were agoraphobic germaphobes with basement offices. The only thing constant is that they were all alone and have stayed that way. </p>
<p>The physical world is a surreal ghost town. Those left living can't leave the unique circumstances of fate that spared them. Communication, to understate it, is difficult. The telecommunication networks are worthless. During the outset of calamity all circuits, and switchboards were overloaded and failed. Attempts to bring them back were delayed indefinitely by death.<br />
The only means of communication left is the Internet, and even that is rapidly rotting without maintenance. Most major sites are down because of mass amounts of traffic and no upkeep. Any email is effectively worthless, as all major service was interrupted during pandemonium.      </p>
<p>In a cruel twist of fate myspace has emerged as the chosen means of dialogue. Due to its sprawling ubiquity myspace is running uninterrupted residually on a surprisingly resilient network. No one looked to myspace in the opening moments of tragedy, its inanity its own defense, and its servers are intact. It is one of the only viable means of communication. A few lucky survivors in a desperate search for people to talk with remember it as the western worlds preferred way to meet strangers. Against all odds, it becomes the best public forum a few survivors can discover. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the realities of an unfettered and unused cyberspace has unexpected consequences. The rise of the bots. Advanced spamming bots have found ways past updateless defenses, and have begun creating myspace profiles to fulfill their programmed intents. On top of that they seem to be claiming control of dormant profiles. They do their best to imitate humans, and their best is surprisingly well. It seems that human control was limiting the natural learning process of malignant programs. They (or possibly it) have seemed to have finally passed the Turing test.  There is no clarity as to what is real anymore. Myspace, sans content, operates as if nothing has changed. Nearly all profiles are still active, and have seemingly no idea of what happened. </p>
<p>This is the only give away to a digital presence: an unawareness of the devastation of the physical world. Even then that is not enough as some bots integrate information as it is uploaded. Nothing is clear. Perhaps it is one sentient bot. Perhaps it is millions of bots that can't recognize each other as they interact. Perhaps it is only bots. Perhaps a bot doesn't even know when it is a bot.  </p>
<p>Of course these ideas will have to be implied. They will be expressed entirely through myspace's editable options: Profile, videos, blogs, photos, mail, groups, comments, and a few other minor options.  Needless to say this leaves a lot of options for narrative construction. I am going to construct it with the intention of only one profile available to "readers." This is with the intent of making the project manageable. I will only have to create "full content," that is, both in and out, for only the protagonist. </p>
<p>Today I intend 5 characters.<br />
I guarantee that will change. For now, however, our protagonist is a college student living in Minneapolis. The resemblance to me is practical. I have to post video and photo of the protagonist and that is easiest when it can be me. He will be an architectural grad student who happened to be drafting a project in the confines of the small University of Minnesota workspace in the famously labyrinth like basement of McNair Hall when tragedy struck.<br />
(For the record, my father and grandfather are architects. My brother is an architectural grad student. The character will be loosely based on him. I thought it would make a fuller character to create something I was familiar with.)</p>
<p>Other characters I imagine. A middle age women who is a religious nut/prophet. A 35-year old computer programmer. A manic depressive 15 year old male. I envision these characters to specifically address themes I intend to raise. They are flexible, but deeper than they appear here.<br />
The core 5 meet in a group created by the computer programmer. He recognizes that no one is talking about the tragedy because they aren't humans. His is the only group that has anything to do with the plague. Four others join. They seem to be the only people who are alive and looked to my space for communication. </p>
<p>The story of what really happened begins to emerge in the communication of these five. So does the story of what will happen to this tiny subsection of the human race. I think the entirety of the experiment will last 2 or 3 days of intensive updating. I see ambiguous silence as the only potential end.  </p>
<p>As for outside interactors, I am up in the air. I am thinking of sending mass messages of hysteria, and just friending people non-stop. I would be very curious to see how people react. I am worried however that it might generate too much garbage and obscure the narrative. </p>
<p>For the 5 page accompaniment. Confusion and ambiguity are central themes, as are existence. It is unclear who is human in the end if anyone. Themes to be raised: Apocolyptic religious ideas. AI. Reality, hyper-reality, cyber-reality. Mediation. Materiality. Identity. Simulacra. The impact of an entirely virtual world. The existence of narrative in social networking. The demarcations of reality in the present internet. Honesty. Consciousness.<br />
I think in the end the questions being asked are what the hell would happen if the only means of communication, and even existence, were myspace, and what if that alternate reality has to exist at the same time as the (possibly already alternate) reality of myspace today?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Kinda the same <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,517023,00.html"> idea </a></p>
<p>"Facebook users joined in. Under Event Info, the Students Protest for a Free Pakistan put out the word to students of Islamabad's Hamdard University to gather outside the college, in support of other protesting students at LUMS, as well as Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad and Punjab University in Lahore, all simultaneously at 2 p.m. on Nov. 7. The Facebook tagline: "The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall." And in the description of the event, this is what the group had to say: "The time has COME for us students to stand up against the tyranny of a dictator. We must join hands with the countless citizens already protesting for our safety...and protest for our rights...to protect what is ours, and not someone else's to hijack."</p>
