</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>We delved into the topic of societal determining factors at the end of class on Monday. I asked if we were not backing our way into the free will debate. 3NT responded that calling a topic an 'age-old' question robs discussion of its context. Since then, I have been pondering whether the existence of free will is in any way a contextual question. </p>
<p>MY first impulse would deny that free will should addressed in a particular context. Apart from mind-control, how could human fate be deterministic in one era and ot another? I do not think that exponential progression of society can strip man of some innate agency (if it exists). However, it might make informed agency impossible. So perhaps the postmodern era could strip agency itself of any value. </p>
<p>Opinions? Hopefully someone with a stronger philosophy background will contribute structure to this topic.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Free will is a fun one to discuss. The whole idea of society determining one's will is an extreme marxist take on life; the theory wants to say that the media entity has, in fact, brainwashed us. As you mentioned, free will cannot be addressed within a context of time unless "brainwashing" occurs, which these authors would argue has happened to some degree. However, postmodernism is not a marxist theory, the early writers are just marxist. </p>
<p>The Anderson reading has given me the inclining that at some point the marxist domination of postmodern theory will be, or already has been, removed. The definition of postmodern seems to be shifting from author to author, and as the study of "nugacity", postmodernism will eventually lead to nothingness. The everyday becomes something more than the everyday (I think of seinfeld as the example). What is postmodern is fundamentally different today than it was when Lyotard or Jameson was writing. So what am I saying exactly....</p>
<p>I don't think you can use the arguments presented in early postmodern writing as an authority on an unsolvable philosophical question. Until postmodernism can define what postmodernism is, it can't answer any other question.</p>
<p>I hope whatever I just wrote makes a semblance of sense. As anyone that reads my blog posts, I don't like marx and, therefore, my critique is extremely bias. That being said, Marxist theory is wrong on the question of free will; my free will is telling me to hate marx as much as I hate the red sox...</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by Guattari Hero on 28 September 2007 - 9:17pm.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>The spin Althusser puts on the word 'subject' is probably instructive here: 'In the ordinary use of the term, subject in fact means: (1) a free subjectivity, a center of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions; (2) a subjected being, who submits to a higher authority, and is therefore stripped of all freedom except that of freely accepting his submission...the individual //is interpellated as a (free) subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject, i.e. in order that he shall (freely) accept his subjection//, i.e. in order that he shall make the gestures and actions of his subjection 'all by himself'' (p.123).</p>
<p>When you say that Marxists are wrong about the interpellative origins of your positively, all-by-yourself hatred of Marx, you're still in fact vulnerable to the question, 'And where/why did you learn to hate Marx?'  If you answer that you hate Marx because his economic principles don't square with yours, you'll probably be asked where and under what conditions you formed your economic principles, to which you'll answer something about your family, or maybe a high school teacher - whereupon the dutiful Althusserian will point out that family units and educational institutions are insipid and efficient transmitters of ideology, and that another ideology broadcast by these very same transmitters is the ideology of 'freed subjectivity,' of the cult of personhood and individual consciousness, etc.   </p>
<p>As an [insert economic status], [insert gender], [insert race], [insert nationality] subject, you probably are a lot less likely to endorse Marx than, say, well-off male white French intellectuals, but it's important to realize that these bracketed qualities can be construed ideologically, i.e. as 'received narratives' that 'predispose' you in ways that can't be said to be uncomplicatedly 'all your own.'</p>
<p>Another way of putting this: when you say, 'I hate Marx,' Marx is going to say, 'Yes, I can //feel// the anger rising in you, young Bumpkins - take your weapon, strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey toward the dark side will be complete.'</p>

    <div class="content"><p>More like, if you say 'I hate Marx of my own free will,' you end up playing right into (what-you-identify-as) Marxist discussions of free will and subjectivity and ideology and oppositionalist narratives and blah cetera, just as Luke's anger plays him right into the dark side.  </p>
<p>Maybe a better terrible Return of the Jedi analogy would be to suggest that what Admiral Ackbar //really// should have yelled, when he realized that the 'narrative' he had constructed of leading a rebel attack on a 'nonoperational' Death Star was in fact a narrative constructed for him by the Emperor and that he had been interpellated into seemingly against his will, was not 'It's a trap!' but 'It's an ideology!'</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by 3NT on 29 September 2007 - 5:25am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Blankman, your question about context is an important one. I think this sentence gets to the heart of the matter: "Apart from mind-control, how could human fate be deterministic in one era and not another?" Indeed. Though how are we defining "mind-control"? My general response to your inclination to call "free will" quandries transcendental would be that "mind-control" changes from era to era, place to place, culture to culture, etc. As such, one important project for critical discourse is to develop tools for working between and accross social and historical lines to accurately trace how processes of mind-control manifest themselves in different contexts - a historicity of mind-control, if you will. </p>
<p>I might cast a wider net around the notion of "mind-control" than you - and we could have an auxiliary discussion about that. However, unless mind-control is completely non-existent (which is dubious, since the reproduction of systems of property, government, sociality, etc. seems to require the systematic reproduction of certain conceptions of the self in relation to the world [i.e. ideologies]), I think one would be hard-pressed to make the claim that its incarnations do not vary over time, or in different regions, or whatever. </p>
<p>In this sense, I agree with Bumpkins that "free will" is an intractable problem, at least in the formal, trans-historical terms in which we usually see it; I disagree, however, about it being fun to discuss. Who cares about sweeping, dawn-of-time platitudes like "Is man every truly free"? Such questions reduce, rather obviously, to an antinomy. The two "positions" are irreconciliable and analytically indefensible. Do you hate Marx because of free cognition, or because you've been socialized, in whatever sense, to do so? Who knows. But - and this, to my mind is the radical move of postmodern/poststructural discourse - we can certainly have a discussion about the political effects of your (not) believing in Marx. Ultimately, that's what Althusser achieves: re-opening the question; providing a framework by which to link subjective experience to systemic outcomes. </p>
<p>In other news, I'm concerned about Bumpkins' invocations of the word "Marxism" (and all its derivatives), because, in the reply above at least, its content seems purposely vague. When signifiers are left to linger without definite meaning, they come to simultaneously connote everything and nothing, and can thereby be utilized to legitimate or critique anything. Such relativism is entirely unproductive. Rhetorically potent as it might be to assign the vague pejorative, "an extremely Marxist take on life," to any number of disparate systems of belief, we at least deserve an explanation of what, precisely, constitutes "Marxism" in this particular case. </p>
<p>I can say honestly that my take on life is "extremely Marxist." Yet would anyone be able to draw definitive, a priori conclusions about my conceptualization of the world from this statement alone? I don't think so. Does it mean that I insist on tying social and cultural phenomena back to an "economic base"? Does it mean that I think capitalism (a vague signifier in and of itself) will overcome itself in an inevitable revolution? Does it mean that I believe one party should take centralized control of all societal operations? </p>
<p>All of the above, none of the above. Who can say? My point is simply that not all Marxisms are equal. Though many systems of critique embrace (or have been branded by) the nomenclature of "Marxism," not all of them arise out of the same conditions, deal with the same problems, or entail the same political commitments. It's fine to be anti-Marxist; let's just be clear what that means.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by aha on 29 September 2007 - 8:19pm.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>While it's true that 'free-will' is an age-old question, exactly what is understood to be a free-will varies wildly depending on what's being discussed.  Greeks asking whether Oedipus could have evaded his fate, behaviorists investigating the degree to which human actions are conditioned and materialists asking how the reduction of existence to matter bound by (theoretically) understandable natural law affects agency all get lumped in 'free-will'.  I think that traditionally what makes questions of free will 'interesting' to discuss is their bearing on ethics of personal responsibility - how can we hold ___ to blame if their actions were oracly, socially, physically determined?   I don't think any of the writers we've read substantively alter this question.<br />
I think a more interesting line of questioning would be how Jameson's statement that 'culture has become second nature' or that 'culture has replaced nature' bear on freewill, not understood ethically, but merely as the amount of play possible within any ideology, the prospects for the future emergence of new modes of thought.  Whether the fact that sign-systems have proliferated so rapidly through radio, television and advertising so as to create a near constant inundation of ideological messages and the replacement of nature (I think Jameson says that culture has replaced 'nature' both in terms of fundamental human behavior and the non-human world).  What to make of the fact that the postmodern human environment is constituted almost entirely by systems of signs, and that the sublime is to be sought within that system rather than the relatively blank face of non-human nature? </p>
