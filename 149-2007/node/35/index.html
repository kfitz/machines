</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>In beginning to read Anderson's "The Origins of Postmodernity," I noticed something curious in how he begins to unpack the conditions (political, spatial, and intellectual) for the emergence of the Postmodern . . . he names the chapter on the preconditions "Prodromes." A prodrome, according to the Oxford, can be defined as: "A symptom or sign, or a set of symptoms or signs, that is characteristic or premonitory of the onset of a disease." (**Note: this is but one of three definitions proposed, and it may very well be that Anderson didn't mean it in this way.)</p>
<p>My question to you, as the book unfolds, is: how does this influence Anderson's biases on the Postmodern phenomenon? Does he in fact see the Postmodern as a disease?? And if so, how can we cope with living in a "diseased world?" Or what do other thinkers propose as solutions to this gloomy outlook?</p>
<p>OR! Do you think Anderson merely names this chapter "Prodromes" to indicate the fomenting seeds of the Postmodern condition/the beginning of the book??</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am about 30 or so pages into The Origins and I have come across some sentences that I need to reread five times just to say every word in my head. Take for example:</p>
<p>"Caught between ideological truculence and demystifying nugacity, caught in its own kitsch, postmodernism has become a kind of eclectic raillery, the refined prurience of our borrowed pleasures and trivial disbeliefs."</p>
<p>Firefox's spell check doesn't even have nugacity in the dictionary (Def: something insignificant or inconsequential). This whole sentence is basically saying postmodernism revels in the insignificant. There, I said it, without using kitsch.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Anderson has a tendency to 'obnubilate' his sentences' meanings with awful grabs for vocab. cred. I think what ends up distinguishing him from more successful vocab. authors, like, say, Nicholson Baker, is that whereas Anderson will just hail-mary these ridiculous flashbangs - 'prodrome!'; 'obnubilate!' - into otherwise flat, workmanlike prose, Baker tends to generate a bounce and a verve in each sentence the upper swell of which can sustain the occasional 'opusculum.' Hell for Perry Anderson will be being devoured by OEDs.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>To me, this book was like a history lesson full of unecessarily challenging vocabulary.  Anderson introduces people who first coined and forged the path into postmodernism, and writes about the development of the concept.  I am thoroughly confused.  Could someone try to simplify his outlook on postmodernism to something as simple as positive or negative?  Maybe that could help us come to a consensus about how he wanted to use the word 'prodrome'.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by ramekins on 1 October 2007 - 10:53am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It seem to me that, once again, we have to be careful of dualisms such as "positive" or "negative" when referring to postmodernism. My reading of Anderson was basically that, while postmodernism began with a set of scattered readings, Jameson was the guy that really brought it all together in his lecture at the Whitney. He "captured" and synthesized the postmodern and consequently "set the terms of subsequent debate." (78) Anderson points out that significant writings on the subject have likewise come from Marxists who have "attempted to supplement or correct" his original definition of the condition: our schizophrenic loss of historicity (&amp; the nostalgia that accompanies it), the creation of kitsch in the breakdown between high and lowbrow culture, a depthlessness of experience as attributed to the simulacrum, etc. which we have discussed in class. </p>
<p>That said, Anderson points out that "Jameson has insisted on the futility of moralizing about the rise of the postmodern...Ethical doctrines presupposed a certain social homogeneity, in which they could rewrite institutional exigencies as interpersonal norms, and thereby repress political realities in 'the archaic categories of good and evil, long since unmasked by Nietzche as the sedimented traces of power relationships'" (65). </p>
<p>So, Jameson isn't really about deciding whether or not postmodernism is good or evil/bad/unfortunate. It just sort of is. Because. And Anderson's usage of words such as "wondrous" to describe "this unwaveringly commited thinker" whose voice has been "without equal," I would venture to guess that he's a pretty big fan of Jameson himself, as well as his efforts to stay away from moralizing the movement. </p>
<p>I also found the word prodromes a bit odd, maybe it seemed a little out of place (probably because I'd never heard it before), but doesn't it seem eerily appropriate because/inspite of its meaning? The impossibility of political alternatives to capitalism, and the death of the Marxist/socialist narrative in the face of infectious plague of a "amoral" capitalism could explain this usage. It could also be a play on Jameson's parasitic definition of pastiche, described by Anderson on pg. 60</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Anderson's whole-hearted alliance with Jameson made his history lessons hard to swallow--an overview of the origins, capture, after effects, etc. of postmodernism, its various thinkers and theorists, from a single Anderson/Jameson perspective. I don't know enough/anything about most of the writers he discusses to offer an alternative perspective or argument--I finished the book not knowing how much of the history I should believe and how much to question.</p>
<p>What particularly tripped me up was his use of a left-right alliance to describe emerging theorists of postmodernity (e.g., Anderson's discussion of Lyotard's shifting political affiliations, "the vicissitudes of Lyotard's political trajectory" (29)). My understanding of the Left and the Right are entirely colored by today's politics--it seems that the left-right spectrum (a) at the time and (b) in cultural theory is aligned with different values, a twist on the Dem/Rep dichotomy that I know.</p>
<p>All that I understand of the Left vs. Right spectrum that Anderson harps on is that leftist writers are (perhaps?) more concerned with the collective while the right is more concerned with ownership--ownership of identity, for example, and the projection of that identity outwards. Could anyone give a clearer description of the spectrum? It could help me to organize the writers that Anderson presents...</p>
