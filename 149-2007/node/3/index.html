</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Let me throw out a disclaimer: This post is long and I would be very impressed if anyone besides KF decides to read the whole thing. That being said, I like the last paragraph the best and the one on Benjamin. So if you decide to even read any farther down my post, thats what I recommend.</p>
<p>While I realize that the material presented by Jacques Derrida is dense by nature, his writing is extremely wordy. He constantly has to rephrase his points because they are next to impossible to fully comprehend with one reading. I think the verbosity of his writing detracts from the points he is trying to present. That being said, here are some of the more important tid bits of information I took from the reading:<br />
-	The importance of the "center" cannot be understated. The center, according to Derrida, defines the object, idea, or what have you. The origin of the "thing" is its most important characteristic. The center creates an illusion of structure.<br />
-	"Myths are anonymous" is the single best line Derrida uses to rebut Levi-Strauss [apparently the arch nemesis of Derrida]. If you accept the argument that the center defines the structure, then a myth cannot have a defined structure because it admits to not having a center, specifically an author.<br />
-	"Empiricism is the matrix of all faults menacing a discourse which continuesâ€¦ to consider itself scientific." I don't think I completely understand the meaning associated with this quote, but I know there is a lot to it.</p>
<p>Walter Benjamin's Illumination reading put artwork, or at least movies, into a new perspective for me. His focus on the disconnect between the performer, the audience, and the audience's interaction was radically different than any thought I have had on the subject. I think the era in which he wrote this article has to do with his "hatred" for film; special effects sucked/ non-existent and camera angles were relatively fixed. Actors like Jack Nicholson and Kevin Spacey were not in the spotlight and Marylyn Monroe was still a big deal.<br />
The STERILIZATION OF ART is something I did not notice on my own accord, but when Benjamin points it out it becomes glaringly obvious. The immediate reaction to an actual masterpiece is reduced or limited because of exposure to reproductions of lower quality that make the prized piece of artwork seem ordinary. I took that to be a very interesting concept.</p>
<p>I did not enjoy the Horkheimer and Adorno reading. Maybe some of their points, or the flow of the paper, was lost in translation, but I felt it to be repetitive and extreme. They got the point across in the first five pages that capitalism spoils art by main it too main stream. Originality is lost to blandness for the sake of higher profits. I felt that the authors repeated this one statement for the entirety of the essay and that constant repetition does not make for the best argument.<br />
The material of the essay struck me as being dated, possibly. Dated is probably the wrong adjective, but the authors seemed to miss the entire idea of a movie going experience, at least my idea of the experience. I go to a movie to "veg out" to be in a fantasy world for two hours. The movie does not have to inspire me; I just want to forget about life for a while. If all movies are the same, but enjoyable, who cares? "Are we not entertained?"</p>
<p>I don't like Marxists. No offense to anybody who is Marxist in class, I'm sure you are awesome. Althusser makes an interesting observation in the Church/School relationship, namely that schools have taken the historical place of churches as the place where yougins spend their formative years being brainwashed by the "state". I thrive in the current system of "state" run apparatuses and have a hard time bashing them for fear of hypocrisy, but I understand why people who didn't fare as well could have an issue with them.<br />
The other argument that always gets on my nerves is the "exploitation of the working class by the managing aristocracy". This argument is flawed in two ways: 1. People get paid a wage and no one forces anyone to do anything. And 2. Destiny does not determine your position. Communist Russia determined what you would be when you grow up; in capitalist America you can be whatever you want as long as you are smart enough and work hard. Good golly politics are fun.</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by Anonymous on 14 September 2007 - 1:20am.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>A few questions to mull over:<br />
- How do you define 'smart' enough?<br />
- What is 'working hard enough'?<br />
- Do factors of socioeconomic class or race or gender or nationality affect one's ability to 'be whatever you want'?<br />
- Are there ways in which those who start life at the top of the capitalist cycle (ie: with capital to invest) might be advantaged over those who are born into conditions where capital is not so easily employed?</p>
<p>And to tie it back:<br />
- Have you ever seen a mainstream movie that challenges this way of thinking about 'capitalist America'?<br />
- What does this say about the way the culture industry treats the ideology of capitalism?</p>
<p>Call me a Marxist, but I don't think it's all about hard work.  It ain't a level playing field, and as I sense A&amp;H, Benjamin, etc. are trying to point out, the veil that mass media encourages us to keep down is that of a purely meritocratic society, because it's in the interest of the culture industry to keep American capitalism at its status quo.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>To add another question to this lovely list: </p>
<p>- What notion of Marxism are you using to formulate the pejorative "Marxist"?</p>
<p>Marxism means many things, and I think it would be useful to clarify our definitions (which doesn't mean that they have to be singular or univocal at all). For instance, if Marxism simply means an unwillingness to accept the claims of the supposed meritocracy functioning in America today, then wouldn't it be absurd not to call yourself a Marxist? The notion that capital flow has an inherent, structural element of polarization is hardly radical...</p>
