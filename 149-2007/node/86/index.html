<p>Recently, I've noted that advetisements have lost some of their connection with the products it represents. First, many ads no longer specify a product and instead promote a corporate brand image. Additionally, the effects of these ads for billion dollars corporations cannot be measured so easily. Sales do not plummet because of a bad McDonald's commercial. That how I understood it when Baudrillard says "advertising is no longer a stake." Major marketing companies are increasingly insulated by focus groups and market research. Besides, the most popular ads rarely attempt a direct connection with their viewers anymore (eg. Budweiser Frogs, Geico Cavemen, Sprite 'Subliminal' advertising). I think JB convincingly locates advertising in our current era.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>You thought McDonalds.  That has been burned into your psyche, such that you can't NOT think of McDs when someone says 'golden arches.'</p>
<p>Bone chilling, really.  </p>
<p>In this sense, I would argue that advertisements are NEVER NOT (or always are) trying to make a connection with their viewers.  Advertisements are inherently ABOUT viewership, even when subtle and seemingly not so.  Frogs and geckos and cavemen are branding tactics - they are means of imprinting corporate meaning into our consciousness.  So that whenever we hear a frog utter a deep bellowing 'ribbit,' we conjure images of Budweiser toads in our mind's eye.  </p>
<p>We might argue that this is an inherently simulacral state of advertising - when the referent product is no longer necessary to the success of the ad.  By the viewer is always essential - for without viewership, without be able to be understood by a viewer, the ad will ultimately fail.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>One of my favorite parts of Infinite Jest is Wallace's prophetic description of  future advertising, whose main goal has become to get as many viewers as possible to watch one ad, and then deter as many as possible from watching any more. To achieve this, ads become purposely offensive to such an excessive degree that one is compelled to keep watching (in the "head rolling down the highway" sense) but the desire to change the channel, or even turn off the television, sets in immediately upon the ad's completion. So, via manipulation of the psychic economy of their viewers, ads begin to subvert other ads. It's kind of like comedian Bill Hicks's prediction that in the near future television ads will consist in nothing more than 30-second clips of pornography with the words "Drink Coke" at the end - except with an element of predatory practice thrown in to boot.</p>
<p>Bleak predictions aside, at present advertising exists in an odd aporetic state, since, as Blankman points out above, "the effects of these ads for billion dollars corporations cannot be measured so easily," and ultimately, "sales do not plummet because of a bad McDonald's commercial." At the same time, however, there is an overwhelming sense, especially given the increasing homogeneity of products, that advertising matters more than ever. Ads are thus akin to political campaigns: in some sense, it no longer "matters" what presidential candidates believe, since, according to opinion polls (which Baudrillard would no doubt analyze as a pathetic vestige of facticity in the postmodern world designed to maintain the operative illusion that truth exists outside of such opinion), the overwhelming majority of people realize that politicians are full of shit. Yet somehow it's still detrimental to not go through the transparently nonsensical motions of electioneering. It's all empty discourse, but it there is much to be lost and gained in utilizing precisely the right kind of empty discourse! It reminds me of the scene in Catch-22 in which Yosserian's lover gets mad at him for questioning God's benevolence. He counters, I thought we were both atheists?, and she responds, "well, I am; it's just that the God I don't believe in is much friendlier than the God you don't believe in." Brilliant and topical. In general, people in the so-called "secular" world actually believe in far more than they are willing to publically admit, and this unwillingness ends up fueling the ideological currents of global capitalism.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Back to blankman's reading of "advertising is no longer at stake," I understood this statement in reference not to the content of advertising itself (ie: in reference to non-products, as you say) but that our fascination in information and digital effects have replaced our former obsession with the advertisement.  Baudrillard writes "The 'thrill' of advertising has been displaced onto computers and onto the miniaturization of everyday life by computer science" (p. 89).  Advertising was once fascinating for its power to "simplify all languages," a power that Baudrillard claims is now in the hands of computer science.  We are now mesmerized by the multi-facets of the computer experience to simplify our experience.  I would argue that we are still enraptured in advertising, but only so far in that we have treat is as a natural experience in our daily lives.  The magic of computers is still new.</p>
