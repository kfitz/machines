</ul></div>    <div class="content"><p>Well that was a very interesting last hour and 1/2. I think I experienced everything there ever is to experience in a reading for an upper level college course. In Capitalism and Schizophrenia, I got my fair of shits and fucks. An explanation of machines ("Everything is a machine")(2) and a little more than  I ever wanted to know about a certain judge...</p>
<p>In the spirit of G&amp;D, I'm might skip around a bit in my thought process and analysis. "Producing is always something "grafted onto" the product; and for that reason desiring-production is production of production, just as every machine is a machine connected to another machine."(6) Using his definition of machine, all he is saying is that everything comes from something and that that same everything connected to every something. However, I contended that everything is not produced, but consumed by something. One form of production does not beget another form of production; rather, my consumption spurs someone else's consumption. My expenses are another's income and, therefore, consumerism keeps the cycle running, not production. The producers are only byproducts of the consumers wants; producers do not determine my wants (let the criticism begin - society determines my wants, advertising determines my wants, etc... Why can't I just determine my wants have my consumption do the work. It is, after all, all about me.)</p>
<p>Whats a body without organs? An idea?</p>
<p>How can a body without organs record anything?(11) Does body=machine or is the body a machine and an organless body a machine made of ethereal material?</p>
<p>Talking about the celibate machine and the schizophrenic experience(18), G&amp;D go on to say these experiences "are often described as hallucinations and delirium, but the basic phenomenon of hallucination (I see, I hear) and the basic phenomenon of delirium (I think...) presuppose an I feel at an even deeper level, which gives hallucinations their object and thought delirium its content..." Hallucinations and delirium are an experience that is greater and "deeper" than that experienced by the ordinary man. The intensity of such a visual, even if it is not "real" can have such a profound on the individual that it overtakes or becomes something more than reality. Its constant ecstasy in a sense: an out of body experience one cannot control - a bad trip. Its sounds awesome and horrible at the same time.</p>
<p>"Freud doesn't like schizophrenics... They mistake words for things."(23) Words aren't things? Even if they are nothing more than signifies, doesn't the very fact that they can become something greater than themselves make the "things". If "sunbeams into his ass" conjures up an idea or a visual, are not the words some thing? (Poor judge...)</p>
<p>I hope the second half of this reading has some sense of order to it. I need order; i do not function properly in chaos. I'm posting on a Wednesday, I obviously have some strict structure in my life... The mind is a terrible thing.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Haha...this was a very amusing post. First I had thought that it made sense that production was everything, but with your explanation of how consumption "keeps the cycle running", I feel like that may actually make more sense. Or rather, both concepts together because can there be one without the other?</p>
<p>A bold statement to claim that you know what you want especially in a Postmodernism class... ! =] And for someone who needs strict structure in your life, I wonder what your overall sentiment is with the whole structureless postmodern</p>
<p>I also need assistance with the whole concept of a "body without organs"...</p>

    <div class="submitted">Submitted by snaggle on 4 November 2007 - 11:01pm.</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I read the body without organs as being the adverse of psychoanalysis.  Freudian theory consistently attempts to turn everything into a fantasty.  There is no real anymore because nothing can hold any more significance than a fantasy.  The body without organs takes everything away, thus there are no fantasies.  The body without organs is the schizophrenic.  In a quite amusing section, D&amp;G describe a schizophrenic's response to Freud: "Yes, I quite agree, naturally the talking birds are young girls, and the superior God is my daddy and the inferior God my brother" (14).  The person suffering from schizophrenia does not play by capitalism's rules.  They do not allow their fantasies or desires to be produced by anyone but themselves.  They have no concrete identity and I feel this is what makes them the ultimate body without organs.  I hardly believe that D&amp;G are attempting to glamorize mental diseases but much of their paper serves as a harsh critique of psychoanalysis.  It is yet another mode of thought created by capitalism to reinforce their machines.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While reading Anti-Oedipus, bodies without organs as a concept had particularly tripped me up; from its early introduction, I attached a negative connotation to the term (probably because I associated â€œwithoutâ€ with a lack that the body supposedly suffers fromâ€¦).  It wasnâ€™t until later in the reading that I had to reevaluate how I understood the body without organsâ€”perhaps as something we should strive for and attain.</p>
<p>Mostly, I donâ€™t want to box it into a steady definitionâ€”my guess is that weâ€™re  meant to comprehend the term through gestures and motion instead of concise explanations.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>What I do know...<br />
  - the body without organs is nonproductive, but produced as the identity of producing and the product; belongs to the realm of antiproduction<br />
  - it is not a projection, or an image<br />
  - when it repulses desiring-machines, it is called "repression"<br />
  - in the capitalism example, the body without organs (capital) is responsible for the proliferation of the relationship between the machine and itself, and produces value<br />
  - it attracts and appropriates desiring-production<br />
  - its not God, but the energy that sweeps through it is divine<br />
  - its mysticallll duuude. constructs mad delirium.<br />
  - it is also "an egg" </p>
<p>The phrase "bodies without organs" comes from Artaud's "To Have Done with the Judgment of God:"<br />
     When you will have made him a body without organs,<br />
     then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions<br />
     and restored him to his true freedom.</p>
<p>So it seems that the concept of bodies without organs seeks to invoke an element of transcendence from organ machines. D&amp;G write "The body without organs, the unproductive, the uncomsumable, serves as a surface for the recording of the entire process of production of desire, so that desiring machines seem to emanate from it in the apparent objective movement that establishes a relationship between the machines and the body without organs." (11) For all their hating on dichotomies, it seems to me that they might have set one up here; they at least note that a conflict arises between the two (9). </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not exactly sure, but it seems to be a place occupied by force, energy or potential to production placed in conjunction with (an attraction to?) the machines. Bodies without organs serve as a "recording space" to construct a concept of production. They mediate production, but sort of via their own existence, I think. It seems almost like a precursor, a movitation, a spirit/soul of what becomes realized in production/life? The subject is not at the center (that's where the machine is), but the subject is on the periphery with no fixed identity. The subject seem subjected to the attractions and repulsions experienced by the body without organs, and then occupies that state. ish.</p>
<p>Ps you should look up Artaud. He was a nutjob, naturally.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This thread is pretty helpful and I wish I had had the chance to read it last night while I was struggling through the last bits of the reading.  It's nice to hear other peoples' interpretations of what ends up being a fairly important concept in D&amp;G's theory.  My concept of the body without organs is heavily influenced by the wikipedia page, largely because after I read it things started to make more sense to me.  I view it as do a lot of other posters here, a sort of abstract, non-centered way of looking at subjecthood.  As you put it ramekins, on the periphery, and without a totally fixed identity.  After reading through everyone else's responses to this strange construct, I wonder if the BwO isn't a way for D&amp;G to deal with the experience of having a unitary agency and subject; a strangely Cartesian sort of "I".  It seems that in order to make the shift of the subject from center to plateau, a new way to conceptualize and think about local sources of agency would be helpful.</p>
