<blockquote>
  <p>This course will attempt to trace the development of the American novel during 
    the first half of what has been called &quot;the American century.&quot; The 
    twentieth century was largely marked by accelerated urbanization, technologization, 
    and the rise of &quot;new&quot; media such as film that seemed to demonstrate 
    an increasing focus in American culture on performativity, specularity, and 
    consumption. Over the course of the semester, we'll trace similar changes 
    in conventional narrative genres (such as the novel of manners) and explore 
    the often-contested definitions of the period's novelistic styles (including 
    naturalism and modernism). We'll pay particular attention to the ways that 
    writing by and about women and African-Americans dramatically affects our 
    understanding of what it is to be both &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;American.&quot;<br>
