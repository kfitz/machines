<blockquote> 
  <p>This course will focus on the ways that Marxist social thought underwrites 
    its recent descendant, Cultural Studies, and the ways that it can inform the 
    study of the contemporary media. To this end, we'll read Marx and his many 
    followers, as well as more contemporary revisions of Marxist thought. We'll 
    also read a number of critical applications of Marxist theory to various forms 
    of cultural production. The course will be driven by concerns raised by student 
    interest -- the goal is not simply that you emerge understanding more about 
    Marxism and its role in cultural analysis, but also that you take an active 
    role in <em>thinking</em> this critical method. Therefore, the class will 
    be focused around group projects, student presentations, and discussion; lectures 
    will be available, but only in response to specific questions and concerns.<br>
