  <p><span class="subhead4">Course Requirements and Grading</span></p>
  <p><span class="sage">Attendance and Participation:</span> As our work here 
    will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness are indispensable, 
    and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; each additional 
    unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. Moreover, chronic late 
    arrivals will not be tolerated; for every three late arrivals, one unexcused 
    absence will accrue. Finally, be aware that presence without preparedness 
    does not count. Do the reading. (15%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Group Work</span>: During the second week of classes, 
    I will divide the class into groups of 4 students. These working groups will 
    serve multiple purposes during the semester: you will do some in-class discussion 
    in these groups, you will share the burden of reading assignments within the 
    groups, and you will work on group projects together. Among these projects 
    will be an in-class presentation requirement; on two occasions this semester, 
    your group will be called upon to lead our class discussion by giving a brief 
    presentation and directing the ensuing conversation. This presentation and 
    facilitation will be peer evaluated. Your overall work in the group will be 
    evaluated by the group's other members. More information to follow. 
    (25%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Papers:</span> Shortly before the mid-point of the semester, 
    you will produce an 8-page paper in which you will carefully consider some 
    aspect of the theoretical discourse we have covered to that point. The term 
    paper, due at the end of the semester, will be 15 pages long, will involve 
    substantial research, and will make a complex, well-defined argument in which 
    you seek to apply the theoretical material we have covered to the cultural 
    object or phenomenon of your choosing. You will submit a proposal and an annotated 
    bibliography for this paper several weeks in advance of the paper itself; 
    shortly before the paper itself is due, you will submit a draft to a peer 
    reviewer. All papers must use proper MLA format. <span class="highlight">Late 
    papers will only be accepted by prior arrangement.</span> Again, more details 
    to follow. (brief paper, 20%; term paper, 40%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">N.B.:</span> There are currently no exams scheduled for 
    this class. I reserve the right to change my mind, however, if I feel an insufficient 
    number of people are completing the readings each week. Do your friends a 
    favor: do the reading, talk in class, and avoid a nasty final exam.<br>
