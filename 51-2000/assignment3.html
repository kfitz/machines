<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Length: 12-15 pages (with 
  1&quot; margins, in 12-point Times)</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your final assignment is 
  to write a well-researched, thoughtful, critically astute, and above all <i>interesting</i> 
  analytical research paper on the topic of your choice. The topic you select 
  should involve at least one of the authors we've read this semester, though 
  you may use more. You may choose to focus solely upon the novels we've read 
  this semester, but you may also choose to involve other works by the writer(s) 
  you choose to discuss. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your paper should make 
  a focused, insightful, well-elaborated, well-supported argument about the novel(s) 
  you select. In addition to performing a close critical analysis of your primary 
  texts, your paper must engage a minimum of TWO secondary texts. These may be 
  literary, critical, historical, cultural, etc., so long as your use of the secondary 
  texts is significant. In other words, your secondary texts must illuminate something 
  about the novels you're discussing that is absolutely pertinent to your argument. 
  Be sure, however, that your paper does not devolve into a report on the research 
  you've done; the center of this paper is, as always, your own original thought. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This assignment involves 
  three requirements: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1. Proposal:</b> On 
  <b>Tuesday, October 31</b>, you will hand in to me a 250-500 word (1-2 page, 
  double-spaced) statement of the argument that you intend to explore in your 
  paper. This is of course not to suggest that you will be tied to this argument, 
  or that it won't be affected by the research you will do. But this proposal 
  should let me know the basics of what you're interested in: the writer or writers 
  (and novel or novels) you want to deal with, the approach you intend to take, 
  the conclusions you suspect you might reach -- and, above all, why you're interested 
  in this topic. This need not be a polished piece of prose, but do give me as 
  much information as you can; my feedback on this proposal may be helpful in 
  focusing your investigation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>2. Annotated bibliography:</b> 
  On <b>Tuesday, November 14</b>, you will hand in to me an annotated bibliography, 
  letting me know the extent of the research you've done so far. This bibliography 
  must contain at least seven separate secondary texts (books, articles, etc.); 
  each entry must also contain a note from you (hence the &quot;annotated&quot; part) about 
  the text, explaining what this text is, what its basic argument is, and how 
  this item will benefit your investigation. Note that you will not be required 
  to cite all of the works you list in your paper, but this range of texts should 
  help you find secondary texts that genuinely illuminate your argument, rather 
  than simply fulfilling the secondary text requirement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3. Paper:</b> The thing 
  itself. Which must, as always, use MLA format, must conform to the length guidelines 
  above, and must -- MUST -- be carefully proofread. Papers whose meaning is obscured 
  by a plethora of typographical or spelling errors will be returned unread, and 
  will incur late penalties until resubmitted. You should also make use of your 
  friends, classmates, and the writing fellows in refining both your ideas and 
  your writing. To that end, there is a subsidiary requirement: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3a. Peer review:</b> 
  On <b>Tuesday, November 21</b>, you should hand a draft of your paper (in whatever 
  state of completion) to your peer review partner, and you should get a copy 
  of your partner's paper. I will leave it to you to pair yourselves up, but make 
  sure you speak with your partner soon. The two of you should compare notes as 
  you're working on your drafts, and should comment thoroughly and constructively 
  on the drafts themselves, helping one another to clarify writing issues, deepen 
  your analysis, and complicate your argument. These commented drafts must be 
  returned to the author on the following <b>Tuesday, November 28</b>, so that 
  each of you will have a week to revise your papers as necessary. When you turn 
  in your final draft, <b>you must turn in the commented first draft as well</b>. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="660033">Note: 
  All deadlines are firm. No extensions will be granted.</font></b></font></p>
