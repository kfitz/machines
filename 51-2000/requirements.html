<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Course 
  Requirements and Grading</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Attendance and Participation:</b> 
  As our work here will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness 
  are indispensable, and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; 
  each additional unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. Moreover, 
  chronic late arrivals will not be tolerated; for every three late arrivals, 
  one unexcused absence will accrue. Finally, be aware that presence without preparedness 
  does not count. Do the reading. <b>(15%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Reading Responses:</b> 
  Early in the semester, I will divide the class into discussion groups. Each 
  group will be responsible for taking the lead in class discussion, on a rotating 
  basis. Each group will lead a Web Crossings discussion in the days prior to 
  their facilitation; in class, the group will act as &quot;experts,&quot; actively 
  guiding our exploration of the material. Each student will be responsible for 
  participating in each week's Web Crossings discussions, contributing questions 
  and ideas that require further attention during class. While you will only be 
  required to post once each week, posting more often is better. More details 
  to follow. <b>(15% total)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Papers:</b> During the 
  semester, you will produce two 5-page papers in which you will perform a close 
  reading of any element of a particular group of texts. These papers may later 
  serve as the jumping-off point for your term paper, or you may abandon these 
  topics altogether and work on something new. The term paper, due at the end 
  of the semester, will be 15 pages long, will involve substantial research, and 
  will make a complex, well-defined argument. You will submit a proposal and an 
  annotated bibliography for this paper several weeks in advance of the paper 
  itself; shortly before the paper itself is due, you will submit a draft to a 
  peer reviewer. All papers must use proper MLA format. Late papers will only 
  be accepted by prior arrangement. Again, more details to follow. <b>(brief papers, 
  15% each; term paper, 40%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>N.B.:</b> There are 
  currently no quizzes or exams scheduled for this class. I reserve the right 
  to change my mind about this, however, if I feel an insufficient number of people 
  are completing the readings each week. Do your friends a favor: do the reading, 
  talk in class, and avoid a nasty final exam.</font></p>
