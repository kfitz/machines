  Description</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This course will attempt 
  to trace the development of the American novel during the first half of what 
  has been called &quot;the American century.&quot; The twentieth century was 
  largely marked by rampant urbanization, technologization, and the rise of &quot;new&quot; 
  media such as film that seemed to demonstrate an increasing focus in American 
  culture on performativity, specularity, and consumption. Over the course of 
  the semester, we'll trace changes in conventional narrative genres (such as 
  the novel of manners) and explore the often-contested definitions of the period's 
  novelistic styles (including naturalism and modernism). We'll pay particular 
  attention to the ways that writing by and about women and African-Americans 
  dramatically affects our understanding of pre-World War II America. </font>
