<h3 class="title">Inside Cavadagna’s Office</h3>

<p>Calvino’s emphasis on the physicality of books provides an interesting angle to consider the way we think about textuality and its relationship to writing technologies and literary production.  Along with the two main Readers of Calvino’s novel, we are accustomed to think of texts in books as being solid, complete, and authoritative.  By rupturing the various “texts” within the novel, presenting books with mixed up signatures, incomplete thoughts, and lost sections, Calvino creates an inter-textual reading experience which tests the boundaries of narrative.  The textual ruptures of <i>If on a winter’s night a traveler </i>lead us to question how the presentation of texts in book form – a solid, sequential, glued, and closed format – has shaped our cultural understanding of reading.  Interestingly, Calvino presents most of these ruptures in the context of literary production; a technological screw-up jumbles a book’s signatures, the chaos of Cavadagna’s office causes texts to disappear, change, become confused.  </p>

<p>I’m wondering how our culture and our current technology have influenced the way we think about the whole-ness of a text, or what even qualifies as text.  Is Calvino just making transparent the process of textual amalgamation that all readers now use?  When we read, are we just embedding the text into a master narrative – a text that is all texts we have read?  Are current hyper-textual technologies merely making these processes more transparent?</p>

<p>I am not sure that I agree that "we are accustomed to think of texts in books as being solid, complete, and authoritative." Perhaps the alleged completeness of a text is precisely what spurs interpretation. We believe that the textual labyrinth before us is self-contained and ultimately comprehensible. Thus we set out to construct readings of it.</p>

<p>However, if we believe that every text is "authoritative," why do we bother with literary criticism? Why do we ever question textual assumptions, representations, and silences?</p>

<p>I bring up these questions not because I disagree with Alex, but because I feel that something paradoxical happens in the act of reading. Even if the "text itself" (whatever that means) is fragmented and incomplete, the act of interpretation somehow makes it complete. Furthermore, on the question of completeness, why does the novel end with a combination of the various chapter titles into a single sentence? For me, this indicates that even though these various stories are separate and fragmented, the author or the reader still manages to construct connections. Despite the limitations of the attempt at interpretation, I do not think that Calvino (or Pynchon) tries to dissuade the reader from it. After all, there is something uniquely human (by using this word am I setting up an artificial human/non-human or human/machine binary?) about creating meaning from the void.</p>

<p>Also on the question of hypertext: Hyper-textual technologies are interesting because they do not necessarily change the ways that we read. Rather, these technologies make the ways that we already read known to us.</p>
