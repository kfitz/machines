<h3 class="title">On Reading, Writing, and Violence</h3>

<p>In conjunction with our discussion of the "violence" of the interpretive act in Calvino, here's another perspective:  Shelley Jackson (whose <i>Patchwork Girl</i> we'll be reading later in the semester) has recently <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html">announced</a> her newest project, entitled "Skin," for which she seeks participants willing to become part of an "embodied story," in which each will have one word of the story (and possibly a punctuation mark) tattooed upon his or her body.  Each participant is required to send Jackson a photograph documenting the tattoo, but the text "will be published nowhere else, and the author will not permit it to be summarized, quoted, described, set to music, or adapted for film, theater, television or any other medium."  Most interesting to me, however, is the fate of those so inscribed:</p>

<blockquote>From this time on, participants will be known as "words". They are not understood as carriers or agents of the texts they bear, but as its embodiments. As a result, injuries to  the printed texts, such as dermabrasion, laser surgery, tattoo cover work or the loss of body parts, will not be considered to alter the work. Only the death of words effaces them from the text. As words die the story will change; when the last word dies the story will also have died. The author will make every effort to attend the funerals of her words.</blockquote>

<p>This is a really provocative project, but one that seems to me to do a double violence to the idea of readership -- both physically carving the text itself into its ostensible audience (arguably "demoting" them to the unconsciousness of inscription itself) while simultaneously reserving all of the pleasures of reading to the author.</p>

<p>(Other discussions of this project have popped up on a number of blogs; see, for instance, <a href="http://rhubarb.typepad.com/index/2003/09/now_this_is_coo.html">rhubarb</a> and <a href="http://caxton.stockton.edu/rettberg/discuss/msgReader$109">Scott Rettberg</a>, among a slew of others.)</p>

<p>While the Skin project seems to be a literal "embodiment" of the kind of textual violence we were talking about in class (enforcing a certain authorial interpretation of content upon the reader), I would question whether or not Shelley Jackson's project could truly be called a "text."  Whether in book form or in hypertext, “text” in our class discussions has always signified a “medium” – a space of inscription that forms a boundary between reader and author.  This boundary, which allows for interpretation, for vagueness, for reading itself, seems (to me) to be one of the most essential qualities of the literary.  Jackson’s project appears to dissolve the textual boundary completely.  She is directly contacting her “words” through email, conversing with them through correspondence to explain the project and inscribe her messages.  Once the words are inscribed, the participants themselves (and the author) will be the only ones with the privileges to access the “text,” a process which would seem to close off the possibilities of interpretation to anyone not in direct communication with the author.  Furthermore, the mere fact that the “text” is inscribed over so many individual bodies (many of which will never meet) seems to preclude the act of reading for anyone but the author herself.  Projects like this force us to ask: to what degree can a text be fragmented and still considered a text?  We seemed to have no problem considering Calvino’s fractured narrative techniques, or Pynchon’s fragmented sense of objectivity as part of single texts.  But what happens when the text itself is fractured?  Can a hypertext website be said to form a single “text?”  Is the library card catalogue a text?  What about the entire internet?    </p>

<p>While I admit that I find Jackson's project absolutely fascinating and I think that it's potential as a work of VISUAL art is enormous, I take issue with the premise on which she is constructing "Skin." By merely saying "From this time on, participants will be known as 'words'...not [to be] understood as carriers or agents of the texts they bear," does not make it so. Calling a person a "word" no more makes them a word than calling a person a "kitty" makes them a kitty. If a participant loses the limb on which a word is printed, the limb (and the word) are gone; the "text" is altered, whether Jackson likes it or not. Unless the "text" exists only in the original photographs (sent to Jackson), in which case not even the death of the participants would alter the "text." So where does the text exist? God, we could do a whole course on this project alone. Can we talk about this in class?</p>
