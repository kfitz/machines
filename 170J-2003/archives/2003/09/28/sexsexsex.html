<h3 class="title">SEXSEXSEX</h3>

<p>At risk of sounding like the (generally hateful) feminist, Lotaria, I have to ask: Does anyone else have serious issues with the sexuality going on in this novel?  Do the appellations "Reader" (for the male) and "Other Reader" (for the female, who is never really developed as a plausible second-person character) bother anyone else? (Female as the "Other.") What are we to make of the fact that the Writer (Silas Flannery) is male? That the Counterfeiter is male? That all seven of the Readers who pop up at the library at the end are also male? I may be paranoid, which is a class theme anyway, but it seems as though Male is the normative mode of existence in the novel; the Female mode of existence only appears when the plot requires some kind of sexual scenario.  And to complicate our interpretations that much more, Calvino seems to be distinctly AWARE of this, making fun of this contrivance in Chapter 9: </p>

<blockquote>"Reader, what are you doing?...You're the absolute protagonist of this book, very well; but do you believe that gives you the right to have carnal relations with all the female characters? Like this, without any preparation..." (219).</blockquote>

<p>Most of the page is taken up by this truly comical self-consciousness, but does humor or self-awareness really make the novel's sexuality less problematic?  The only female characters are Lotaria, Ludmilla, and (maybe?) Lotaria's mysterious double, Shelia-Alfonsina-Gertrude-of-the-ever-shifting-name. Lotaria is obviously dislikable, mainly due to her (admittedly, over-the-top) feminist ideology--but where does that leave feminism in the novel? Lotaria's identity-less double is so obviously sexually problematic, I don't know where to begin. And though Ludmilla is idealized (as a character, as a woman, as a reader) and supposedly empowered by her position as a pure Reader by the novel's end, I'm still not quite sure what to make of her. If she is actually the "pure Reader," free of interpretation, then isn't she also a *passive* reader, blindly accepting whatever is fed to her?  And we're stuck with the passive female cliche.  But later, Arkadian Porphyrich describes Ludmilla as "the winner" in her conflict with Ermes Marana by reading in such a way as to "uncover truths hidden in the most barefaced fake, and falsity with no attenuating circumstances in words claiming to be most truthful" (239). Doesn't that mean that she's interpreting the texts she reads? Hasn't Calvino been mocking us for our need to interpret all along? Is Ludmilla just a "better" interpreter than the rest of us, doing it the "right" way? I honestly don't know what to make of her or of her role as a reader, which is described simultaneously as empowered and passive. </p>

<p>And what about when the Reader decides at the end that he suddenly wants to marry Ludmila?  And in the next page, they are married.  I'm glad she got to have so much say in that.  Were we adequately prepared for that?  Is it a sort of joke on Calvino's part, a commentary on the happily-ever-after ending?</p>

<p>I don't know that it's directly related to the human/machine theme of this course, but I think the issues of sexuality are so bound up in the power play at work in the novel and in the essential point-of-view here that we really can't ignore them. Any comments, since we probably won't get this in to class time?</p>

<p>[UPDATE:  I've tinkered with your formatting here, W., just to make this a bit more readable.  --KF]</p>

<p>Actually, I'd really like to talk about this in class (though I'd love to see conversation here, too), because I think there are some important and interesting (if perhaps tangential) connections here to our human/machine concerns.  For instance:  remember that Turing's famous test of machine intelligence begins as a test of gender.  It seems to me that the question of whether or not machines can think (or, in the more literal interests of our class, write) are not unconnected to questions about what categories of humans are imagined to be able to think, or, as in Calvino, write...</p>

<p>At the risk of becoming "I keep thinking about this one passage Girl"... I keep thinking about this one passage.</p>

<p>It's about Ermes Marana's obsession with Ludmilla as an ideal reader -- about why the image of her reading was "what he was never able to bear:"</p>

<p>"Ermes Marana dreamed of a literature made entirely of apocrypha, of false attributions, of imitations and counterfeits and pastiches.   If this idea had succeeded in imposing itself,  if a systematic uncertainty as to the identity of the writer had kept the reader from abandoning himself with trust -- trust not so much in what was being told him as in the silent narrating voice -- perhaps externally the edifice of literature would not have changed at all, but beneath, in the foundations, where the relationship and text is established, something would have changed forever. <i>Then Ermes Marana would no longer have felt himself abandoned by Ludmilla absorbed in her reading: between the book and her there would always be insinuated the shadow of mystification, and he, identifying himself with every mystification, would have affirmed his presence</i>" (p. 159, my emphasis). </p>

<p>My question: what's being implied here about Marana's efforts to mess with the Author Function?  Why is Marana's destabilization of that part of traditional notions of a text represented as just another attempt to affirm masculine presence in the face of a woman who by her very existence (in this case, Ludmilla's existence as absolute reader) challenges that presence?  Is this saying anything about Marana's theoretical obsession with killing the Author?  </p>

<p>Are there maybe, then, possibly positive elements to Ludmilla's constant representation as the ever elusive, inexplicable element in the reader-text relationship?   (I put all these thoughts in question form because I really haven't quite made up my mind about it.)</p>

<p>Maybe so, but problems persist in how this dominate/elude relationship is so specifically gendered in the novel -- how the female still has no other role to play than as the mystifying non-male.</p>

<p>I wonder.</p>
