<h3 class="title">What about the end?</h3>

<p>I know this is a rather straightforward question, but it was of particular interest to me in Calvino's novel, a work that seems obsessed with beginnings.  Towards the close of the novel the sole continuous narrative, that of the Reader, takes on an unusual degree of absurdity that is comparable to or even greater than those of the novels he has been reading.  As I'm sure you noticed, everything begins to blend together, from the Lotaria-Ingrid-Etc. character, to the very titles of the books for which the reader has been searching.  I'm not sure what to make of the scene in the library.  Calvino seems to give us a tutorial on the different ways one can read a book, an appropriate ending to a novel that struggles with the meaning of reading, but what of the fact that the titles on the reader's list, when strung together, form the beginning of a book?  Finally, what happens when Calvino suggests there are really only two endings to a book (death or marriage, basically) and he chooses that of marriage between the hero and his primary love interest as the end to his own novel?</p>

<p>Part of me felt that Calvino was making fun of me, as a reader, and my need for closure.  Will any ending do- even one that is as brief, sudden, and formulaic as the one Calvino offers?  The concept of a beginning, middle, and end is certainly linear- so in a novel that seems so fragmented, how does an ending function?  Does it have any value?</p>

<p>D'oh, you beat me to this subject.</p>

<p>I was similarly frustrated with the ending, more because of its abruptness than anything else. You're right, this is a novel all about beginnings, but even something like this has to have an ending, at whatever cost to the formula. So we have one, a quick half-page reassurance that the Reader has indeed succeeded in getting the girl and the missing book(s), and has somehow managed to escape his job as a literary spy in South America. How did we get here from there? The problem is that the novel moves from eleven possible beginnings to one definite end, with no adequate middle to speak of. </p>

<p>It would be too easy for me to say that Calvino ran out of ideas and just decided to end it; the distinct lack of a middle underlines the novel's status outside of the Aristotelian school of classic narrative, although its succumbing to providing an ending, however slapdash, at least shows it isn't too far removed from the norm. But a certain amount of agency is granted to the reader here, as well, as Calvino gives us free reign to create whatever kind of middle we want, so long as it leads back to chapter 12. (In my middle, for instance, the Reader finally returns home after five years of skulking around South America only to find that Ludmilla has shacked up with Ermes Marana's younger brother Mercurio, and the two must sword-fight on the top floor of the tower of Pisa in order to secure the maiden's hand; at any rate, you get the idea.) As for the idea of Calvino making fun of us as readers at the end - well, I feel like he's been doing that all along.</p>

<p>I keep thinking about one of passages Dane highlighted in his presentation -- the one where the Reader and Ludmilla get in bed and read each others bodies, and Calvino/the narrator describes it as a "non-linear" reading, one which "starts at any point, skips, repeats itself, goes backward, insists, ramifies in simultaneous messages" etc etc.  </p>

<p>"A direction can be recognized in it," writes the narrator, "a route to an end, since it tends toward a climax, and with this end in view it arranges rhythmic phrases, metrical scansions, recurrence of motives.   But is climax really the end?  Or is the race toward that end opposed by another drive which works in the opposite direction, swimming against the moments, recovering time."</p>

<p>Obviously the narrator's just dying for us to think about traditional narrative models which tend towards climax (i.e. all plot elements build up until finally, the hero and heroine get married and the end), and about possible alternatives to these -- a model that "swims against the moments" back into the "middle" of the text, to use Chris's term.   </p>

<p>And so the question is begged, how does Calvino's own narrative fit into this?  Emily (and Whitney in her SEXSEXSEX post) mentioned the bizarre, even offensive, artificiality of the marriage at the end.  What a shoddy climax their marriage is, if we can even call it that.   </p>

<p>I guess I'd argue that Calvino, with his ending, and all the started novels in the book which always get cut off before any semblance of climax is reached, is always postponing that narrative drive for climax and "making fun of us" for wanting it.  Either just for arrogance's sake, or else, I guess, to try to get us to a new level of narrative/interpretation/meaning... yeah. I don't know, it's a big project, this one of <i>If on a winter's night a traveler</i>'s.   I still feel left, like our class discussion today was left with it, with the question of the success of it.</p>

<p>I completely disagree that this book does not have a middle. Perhaps the narrative chapters (e.g., "If on a winter's night a traveler") are all mere beginnings, but the the story about the two readers has a beginning, middle, and end. Aside from the second-person narration style and the strange subject matter, this central story is fairly continuous.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the ending is abrupt and absurd. Part of the reason for this might be because, as the seventh reader notes, "in ancient times a story could end only in two ways: having passed all the tests, the hero and the heroine married, or else they died" (259). In this story the hero and the heroine get married. The point of this observation, I think, is that there are a limited number of basic genres and plots. Literary critic Northrop Frye, for instance, separates theater into four basic genres. The same (albeit with slightly altered categories) could be done for fiction as well (both in terms of genre and plots). The ways in which those plots are explored, however, are virtually unlimited. It is in the style and the form (if we can separate these from content) that we discover meaning (and read ourselves). The anti-climatic ending focuses our attention on the process and form of the novel even more.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I do not read this novel as hypertextual (or proto-hypertextual) at all. I do not believe that "Calvino gives us free reign to create whatever kind of middle we want." Granted, there are moments in the novel (e.g., Silas Flannery's diary entry about the story with seven possible endings) that explore the notion of choice. However, Calvino is quite aware that the author still puts certain limitations on the reader (through form, certain assumptions, etc.). Furthermore, we must be cautious of the giddiness that a little freedom brings. After all, as we see with political systems of power (in chapter 10), indulgence (or freedom) and abuse are oftentimes part of the same cycle (see p. 236). In other words, choice is always based in a system that limits choice as well... I'll try to write more on my ideas about power/counterpower in the novel in a further post as well.</p>

<p>What's in a title? The initial post made me wonder why we as readers usually pick a book based on the title and usually the title is only one small part of the entire text. True it is usually all you have to figure out what the book is about  but really a novel can have a title that has absolutely nothing to do with anything obvious in the text. Then again maybe I’m dense and just did not understand the connection.  But anyways In Crying of Lot 49 and If On A Winter's Night A Traveler the reader moves through the text trying to figure out why in the world the author picked THAT title. So I guess the title properly serves as a lead into the text but it usually just kind of throws the reader into the middle of the text and it takes a few pages or in some cases the entire novel for the reader to get their bearings. I am not a patient person and want to know it all right away but I imagine there would be less incentive to actually read the book.</p>
