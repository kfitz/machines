<h3 class="title">Turing/Wiener</h3>

<p>Based on today's conversations (about the Turing test, as well as about the relationship between cybernetics and society), I'm wondering if any of you have come across any websites that might help further our thinking.  For instance:  here's a site dedicated to the <a href="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html">Loebner Prize</a>, which is the ongoing annual competition I mentioned in class today.  (Note the places I was wrong:  the grand prize is $100,000, not $1 million, and though no one has yet won that prize, a lesser prize has been awarded every year.)  Bring us links via the comments, or if you've got more you want to say, begin a new post...</p>

<p>Through the link that KF provided us, I found a place where you can chat with the bot that won the Loebner prize most recently.   It (or she, rather... her name is Alice) is <a href="http://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=f5d922d97e345aa1">here</a> ("http://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=f5d922d97e345aa1"). </p>

<p>She's fun, that's why I'm linking her for you.  I recommend introducing yourself to her, and then asking her these questions:<br />
What color is the sky?<br />
How old are you?<br />
Are you naked?   (I was curious...) <br />
What is your favorite food?<br />
Do you like being a robot?<br />
Do you like computers?</p>

<p>There are problems if you attempt a more sophisticated conversation than this, of course. </p>

<p>But still, after this experience with Alice, I have to say, I'm more convinced than ever that you're all automatons.  If it hadn't been for Turing, I never would have guessed your secret...  </p>

<p>Does spelling count?</p>

<p>Our class discussion today made me remember an incident where a professor of English at Pitzer College once complained that her students were members of the “spell check generation,” as she handed back handwritten journal entries. She went on to explain that because of advances in technology students were loosing the ability to spell correctly without the assistance of a computer.  </p>

<p>As a kid I remember dreading taking spelling tests. The hardest words to spell were words that were not spelled like they sounded, words like phone, and cologne.  Now, if I type the words exactly as they sound fone and coelone the computer tells me that I have misspelled them and correctly guesses the word I intended. </p>

<p> The initial emphasis on correct spelling was to establish a universal method of communication (universal in that all people of a particular language can comprehend the idea expressed) so that people could communicate effectively in a written form. Do children still need to be taught how to spell since a computer spell checker can perform this task for us?    </p>

<p>What if spell check eliminates spelling tests from elementary school curriculum or if proper spelling is not required on a computer spelling test as long as one can guess the intended word? Is this a big deal or does spelling really matter after all since we are headed into a paperless environment?  I must say I am rather jealous if the traditional spelling tests taken by school age children are deleted or changed at some point due to these advances in technology. I cannot help but wonder if spell check is detrimental to society or an advancement and an aid to society? <br />

<p>Here is another computer bot. http://www.zabaware.com/webhal/</p>

<p>This disclaimer is kind of funny. Humans teach it nonsense! (ha ha) I bet the first thing humans try and teach it is curse words. Makes me wonder who and how is "intelligence" defined. </p>

<p>Good google lee mooglie! I did not see this last part until I scrolled down the entire page.  "DubyaSpeak" This is so funny! It comes up with stuff Bush would say to you in a conversation with him and where and when he would say it.<br />
