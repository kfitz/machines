<p>This happened to me when my mom found my website and entered the section that had the "warning, do not enter this page if you are offended by anything whatsoever, and especially if you are my mother" bit at the beginning. Then of course she had to ask me all about it and it was really frustrating. That Onion article is absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>Audre just called my attention to the fact that Prof. Fitzpatrick had posted this same article on her own blog.  For a source as nonlinear and disjointed as the internet, I think it's funny how information spreads.</p>

<p>Did you know that if you search on <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> for the word "the,"  a link to <a href="theonion.com">The Onion</a> is the first thing that comes up?  It must have a huge readership.</p>

<p>I think the first bumper sticker advertising an internet site I ever saw (that was a weird experience... bumper stickers with URLs on them -- talk about remediation) was for The Onion.  </p>

<p>I don’t have a blog, but I wouldn’t be to concerned that my mom would find racy information about me on the internet. First of all, I don’t think she would look.  Second, she is, for the most part, incapable or searching anything out.  However, if I ever have kids, I’ll definitely be able, maybe not willing, but able.  As far as questions about selective privacy go, It’s pretty interesting to think that ours is probably the last generation to have internet-handicapped parents.  </p>

<p>Once upon a time I asked a question in a chat room about summer internships and misspelled a word. It was saved for a few years online, and came up whenever anyone goggled me. It was so awful. My mom discovered it on her own one day and felt the need to fuss at me about it all the time. Also one of my papers was published online from my ID1 class and just this past week my mom berated me for my stupidity in allowing such a thing. I really hate how your mistakes are etched in stone 4 ever! ugh</p>
