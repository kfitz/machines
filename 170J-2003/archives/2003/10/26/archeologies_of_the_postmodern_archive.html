<h3 class="title">Archeologies of the (Post-)modern Archive</h3>

<p>I had the opportunity to see Sven Spieker's talk on "Archeologies of the Modern Archive" last Wednesday. Although the application to the class may be indirect, I thought that some of you might find Professor Spieker's arguments interesting. What follows is based on my memory and my extrapolations so I apologize for the cursory nature of this post.</p>

<p>Spieker began his talk by comparing the paper archive (in the sense of the museum, the bureaucratic archive, and so on) to our contemporary digitial archive (namely, the internet). Despite the technological gap between the two, the idea of the "archive" remains the same in both cases. The word "archive" comes from two different Greek words. The first, "arkhe," refers to the "beginning" or the "commencement." The second, "arkheion," refers to the building of the Arkhons who were the guardians of the archive. Thus, an archive is both the <i>collection of documents </i>that recount a given history and the <i>institution</i> that collects those documents. This distinction also suggests a further question (one that we have considered in class in terms of the inside/outside binary): An archive clearly contains history (or historical documents), but how do we write a history of the archive itself? Or perhaps, using a metaphor prevalent in the 19th century, how do we perform an autopsy of the "body" that is the archive?</p>

<p>In a sense, it is impossible to write the history of the archive. We only know the archive (or, if you prefer, History) by participating in it. Professor Spieker offered an interesting literary example that clarified this point for me. In Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>, Joseph K. attempts to understand various institutions (the law, the bank, and so on). However, he cannot understand or, at least, experience each of these archives without participating in them. At the point when he is "inside" the institutions, Joseph K. (and the reader) can no longer see them from the perspective of the outside.</p>

<p>Another reason why it might be impossible to access the archive without participating in it is that an archive does not store mere files or historical documents. The archive also stores the very order used to classify those objects (for more on this see Michel Foucault's <i>The Order of Things </i>and <i>The Archeology of Knowledge</i>). Thus, there is no such thing as an empty archive that waits to be filled by history. Archives are themselves historical documents that suggest how a given era understood knowledge and how it chose to order tha knowledge. So in the age of the archive (in an age of modernism) we move from the interest with the message to the idea (using McLuhan's famous pronouncement) that the medium <i>is </i>the message.</p>

<p>Professor Spieker also commented on a related subject that is applicable to our work in class. By reading the archive he discussed the question of whether waste, excess, and destruction are "outside" systems or whether they are always necessary parts of a system. Spieker suggests that archives store more than historical documents. They (inevitably) store the destruction of the order that they are trying to preserve. For instance, the archive cannot precent the presence of rats, insects, mildew, light, and so forth. Thus the archive is impossible without the simultaneous deterioration of the archive. In fact, this deterioration does not come exclusively from the outside (that is, the rodents and natural sources). There is also an inherent destruction in the idea of the archive. An archive can only accept new material by destroying the old; waste is necessary for the renewal and growth of the archive. Interestingly enough, this particular model of the archive comes up in the work of an important thinker of the late 19th and early 20th century: Sigmund Freud. The psychical apparatus is theorized much like an archive; we can only remember and live by forgetting and repressing parts of the past.</p>

<p>But anything that passes through the archive is not forgotten (just as the repressed is always liable to return). An archive always holds an "other" element (waste?) that is not accounted for by the archive. In this way, Spieker argues, archives are always a step ahead of themselves and of us.</p>

<p>Well that is my brief summary with extrapolations. Here are a few of my questions to think about and (hopefully) to respond to: </p>

<p>- How do you think that the model of the archive described here applies to the (post-)modern archive? Are elements repressed on the web? Is the medium of the internet (or any form of modern technology) indeed the message? </p>

<p>- Is the blending of medium and message particularly evident in hypertext fiction? Is hypertext fiction a truly revolutionary form or does it often assume that it is "beyond" history (when there is, in fact, a direct connection between p-fiction, as Johns Hopkins Johnson calls it, and hypertext fiction)? </p>

<p>- Is the model of "the archive" discussed here applicable to all fiction (that is, despite the quantity of information offered, are there always destructions and silences)? What does this tell us about the form of the novel? Have we (modern readers) become so accustomed to the novel form that we forget its origins (colonialist British origins according to Edward Said) and assumptions?</p>

<p>I regret missing the talk now.  It sounds like it was very cool -- thanks for sharing it.   I like that we have this space to bring indirect-but-relevant things to the table, as it were.   </p>

<p>The point you mentioned about the impossibility of understanding/experiencing the archive without participating in it seems to takes on an interesting meaning in your post, as you write about the nature of the internet as archive, from within that archive itself -- within this blog of ours. </p>

<p>I'm interested in the concept of internet-as-archive, but not sure how to think about it in terms of this "medium-as-message" idea you've presented.  Do you have any thoughts about it?  Mind if I throw your question right back at you? </p>
