<h3 class="title">FYI Player Piano</h3>

<p>Here is some interesting information that may be of some assistance as you read Vonnegut's Player Piano. Player Piano is the mordant first novel of American Kurt Vonnegut Jr (1922- ). Published to little fanfare only three years after Orwell's "1984" (1949), Player Piano (1952, reprinted 1966) continues the tradition inspired by Zamyatin's novel "We" (1922) and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" (1932). Zamyatin's "We"  is the first modern distopia, and the work on which all the rest are based, or are based on those based on it. It portrays a future of absolute totalitarian communism in which everyone wakes up and dresses and even chews food in unison and all buildings are made of glass so there is no privacy, not even the idea of privacy. Being the first distopia, it is not quite as refined as 1984, for example, but fully as horrifying and more potent due to Zamyatin's brilliant writing. </p>

<p>Aparently Vonnegut's text "Player Piano" is part of the same literary genre as Zamyatin's "We". This genre is called Distopia. Here is a brief explanation of the genre.</p>

<p>"Distopia, also called anti-utopia, is a rare but potent genre of fiction. The word comes from dis-Utopia, referring to the classic "Utopia" which described a perfect world. The word "Utopia" itself means "Nowhere" but has come to mean paradise, since that is what the work described. Dis-Utopia, then, is just the opposite: a Hell on Earth. This fictional form is usually used as a warning, generally a political one, a portrayal of the author's vision of what would happen if that which terrifies him or her became all powerful. </p>

<p>In discussing the genre of distopia it is important to examine the distinction between what I call a "True Distopia" and something which is merely "distopian." In a true distopia it is the distopian world itself which is the focus and purpose of the piece, the artist's message being expressed by the totalitarian world itself, whereas something which is simply distopian takes place in a distopian horrible future, but the distopia itself is not the focus of the book, but more often the characters in it and their story, making it a distopian novel. For example, the movie "Waterworld" is distopian, but in no way does the future depicted convey the message of the creators, but rather the plot and characters are the point of the movie. This distinction may be difficult to make but the difference is very important for how one views the peace and what one gets out of it. </p>

<p>WARNING: if you have never read a true distopia before and plan to, take care! You cannot read it as you would an ordinary novel. If you read for plot and character interaction you will be angered and upset by the horrible world you see. True distopias must be read for the world, not the characters, and the reader must continually have an eye towards the author's comments on society. If you view the characters as the subject you will be angered; if you view them as the means of showing you their world you will be disturbed, enraged, terrified and delighted by these brilliant works. "  (found at http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/1634/Distopia.html)</p>

<p>Also note that Dr. Paul Proteus' name "Proteus" is a kind of  flower known for showy bracts and dense flower heads and is sometimes used as an adjective to describe that something "a varied nature or ability to assume different forms" (Merriam Webster Dictionary).

<p>well, damn.  i've apparently read half of this book only to set myself up for ultimate disappointment in the end, as i've been reading for plot and character interaction as well as the "world."  do you really feel this is a distopia?</p>

<p>and while we're unpacking definitions of proper names...  how about "epicac," folks??  a vomit-inducing drug, if i'm not mistaken...</p>

<p>oh, vonnegut</p>
