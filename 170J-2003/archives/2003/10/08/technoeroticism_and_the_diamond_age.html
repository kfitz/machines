<h3 class="title">Techno-eroticism and <i>The Diamond Age</i></h3>

<p>Let's talk about sex.   I was just looking today at a book by Claudia Springer called <i>Electronic Eros: Bodies and Desire in the Postindustrial Age</i>.  In it, Springer writes about something she calls "techno-eroticism," or, very simply, the intersection between technology and eroticism.  Techno-eroticism can take many forms, whether it's glorifying the strong phallic beauty of a steel turbine, or making out with a hot cyborg in a scifi novel, etc.  It is "the passionate celebration of technological objects of desire."  </p>

<p>Technology and eroticism interact often in <i>The Diamond Age</i>, most bizarrely in the case of the Drummers.  The extremely promiscuous Drummers have particles in their blood that spread through the exchange of body fluids, and then interact:   "Each one is a container for some rod logic and some memory... When one particle encounters another either <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro</i>, they dock and seem to exchange data for a few moments" (307).    </p>

<p>The sex act becomes a form of information exchange, and all the Drummers together function like a massive digital/neural computer running a very complex program.  The Drummers also spread their "information" to non-Drummers, making the size of this "computer" potentially infinite.  (It sounds a lot like a sexually transmitted disease, doesn't it...) </p>

<p>In her study of techno-eroticism, Singer writes, "Debates about what it means to be male or female and how sexuality should be expressed often find their way into popular culture's techno-erotic imagery.  The imagery sometimes explores alternative types of sexuality and at other times retreats to conventional stereotypes from the past."   </p>

<p>Any thoughts on where the Drummer episodes fit into this debate?  Hackworth's wife, a neo-Victorian, divorces Hackworth because of his "immoral" promiscuity.  Hackworth himself seems not a little appalled at having engaged in homosexual acts during his 10-year orgy.  What do you think of the Drummer sex-communication system?  </p>

<p>What about the novel's obsession with nanotechnology in general? --  microscopic technology that becomes literally incorporated into the body, performing a broad range of tasks, often affecting the host -- Hackworth gets the shivers, for example, when he is loaded with particles that fight both other particles and his own immune system.   How are these technologies in <i>The Diamond Age</i> playing with -- or reflecting -- our conceptions of sex, the body and the self?   </p>

<p>What strikes me most about the technology of The Diamond Age is its proximity to the human body.  Should I bother to use the word penetrate?  The human body is a space that can be entered, exited, acted upon, or modified by technology.  guns are set into the skin of human foreheads; nanosites enter and exit human bodies, often without the knowledge of the host.  At the same time humans are more integrated with technology, the technology is becoming more organic - some nanosites function like viruses; much of the technology is voice-controlled, requiring minimal interface.  </p>

<p>I think it's interesting, though, that while some of the sexualized encounters with technology involve a kind of penetration and violation, Stephenson doesn't really give technology a dominating effect like Vonnegut (correct me if you think otherwise).  Humans have mastery over the creation of the technology and how it's used.  We never really get the sense that machines are running the show.  Even when technology "runs amok," as in the nanosite "toner" battles, the adverse effects to humans seem accidental, not part of a power dynamic.  <br />
