<h3 class="title">Welcome</h3>

<p>This is the blogspace I've mentioned several times in class, finally up and running.  You should log in at the address I gave you and begin posting as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I'll be posting here as well -- thoughts that occur in the off hours, links to various resources, and so forth.  I'll also be building a blogroll in the next few days, so look out for a list of links to appear on the left.  Do some exploring, and bring us back good examples of blogs that we should be reading.</p>

<p>My expectations for your writing here are as follows:  each of you should post (at least) one new entry each week, and should respond to (at least) two of your peers' entries each week.  Your posts should be thoughtful, interesting, and well-written.  Attention to grammar, spelling, and other conventions of writing is a must.</p>

<p>Finally, remember:  we're carrying on a conversation with one another here, but we're doing it in public.  Be generous, and keep your broader audience in mind.</p>
