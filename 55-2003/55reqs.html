  <p><span class="subhead4">Course Requirements and Grading</span></p>
  <p><span class="sage">Attendance and Participation:</span> As our work here 
    will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness are indispensable, 
    and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; each additional 
    unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. Moreover, chronic late 
    arrivals will not be tolerated; for every three late arrivals, one unexcused 
    absence will accrue. Attendance at the screenings is likewise required; if 
    you have a conflict, it is your responsibility to ensure that you see the 
    film. Finally, be aware that presence without preparedness does not count. 
    Do the reading. (15%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Readings and Responses</span>: As you'll no doubt quickly 
    note, there's a lot of reading in this class: twelve novels, plus supplementary 
    theoretical and critical essays. As you'll also quickly figure out, most of 
    the novels are very fast reads. While I may narrow your focus in them at times, 
    please note that the supplementary essays are not optional reading; I'll expect 
    each of you to be able to use them in your discussion of the novels. You will 
    be required, moreover, to submit a one-page (single-spaced, 12 point type 
    on letter-size paper) analytical response to each of the texts we read this 
    semester. Your papers should focus on some critical question affecting the 
    text's meaning, and should use a close reading of the text to support its 
    points. These papers will usually be due on the last day we discuss each text, 
    but they absolutely must not rehash class discussion &#8212; these papers 
    should represent your own thoughts about the text in question. You will be 
    allowed to skip one response paper in the course of the semester without penalty; 
    extra points may be awarded if you turn in all of them. Take these papers 
    seriously; they may provide fodder for the longer papers you have to write. 
    <span class="highlight">Absolutely no late papers will be accepted; if you 
    must miss class on the day one is due, turn it in early.</span> (20% total)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Class Facilitation:</span> Early in the semester, I will 
    divide the class into discussion groups. Each group will be responsible for 
    taking the lead in class discussion, on a rotating basis. Each group will 
    facilitate our discussion by giving a brief presentation and by preparing 
    questions and topics that actively guide our exploration of the material. 
    More details to follow. (10% total)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Papers:</span> During the semester, you will produce one 
    4 to 6-page paper in which you will perform a close reading of any element 
    of one of the novels we have read to that point. The term paper, due at the 
    end of the semester, will be 12 to 15 pages long, will involve substantial 
    research, and will make a complex, well-defined argument. You will submit 
    a proposal and an annotated bibliography for this paper several weeks in advance 
    of the paper itself; shortly before the paper itself is due, you will submit 
    a draft to a peer reviewer. All papers must use proper MLA format. <span class="highlight">Late 
    papers will only be accepted by prior arrangement.</span> Again, more details 
    to follow. (midterm paper, 15%; term paper, 40%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">N.B.:</span> There are currently no exams scheduled for 
    this class. I reserve the right to change my mind, however, if I feel an insufficient 
    number of people are completing the readings each week. Do your friends a 
    favor: do the reading, talk in class, and avoid a nasty final exam.<br>
