<blockquote>
  <p>This course will focus on a genre that has only in recent years been taken 
    seriously as a subject for critical discourse: science fiction. We will approach 
    science fiction from a number of complementary perspectives. On the one hand, 
    we will consider the argument forwarded by one critic that science fiction 
    is characterized by &quot;cognitive estrangement,&quot; by creating new worlds 
    that we must struggle to understand. At the same time, we will bear in mind 
    the suggestion that such &quot;other worlds&quot; narratives are always about 
    our world, and that tales of the future are invariably about the present. 
    In so doing, we'll begin with a series of texts that construct what might 
    be thought of as the contemporary science fiction &quot;tradition,&quot; and 
    will follow these with a number of texts that, in varying ways, write back 
    to or against that tradition. Throughout, our focus will be on these writers' 
    widely varying treatments of race and gender, both as part of worlds from 
    which we are &quot;cognitively estranged,&quot; and as part of worlds that 
    tell us something about our own.<br>
