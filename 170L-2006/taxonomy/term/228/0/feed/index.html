 <title>The importance of being truthiness</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/366</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;As soon as we say &#039;I&#039; we begin to lie.&quot;  I&#039;m very curious about this approximate quote of Shelley Jackson&#039;s.  By extension we assume that, since Jackson is a writer and explores this quote in her writing, it can also be stated, &quot;As soon as we write &#039;I&#039; we begin to lie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious about this not so much because I agree or disagree, but because I fail to see the importance.  I have never seen pure objective truth as a goal of writing.  Perhaps more so in a supposedly nonfiction autobiography (but even then not some inarguable mathematical kind of truth,) but never in a fiction, even one based on real characters.  The goal is to take little snippets of truth, character tics such as a boy who expresses himself through his toes, and meld them together into a character that reads as true, regardless of whether he or she is or not.  The truth that writing strives toward is the truth of empathy.  The establishment of an emotional connection between writer and reader.&lt;/p&gt;
