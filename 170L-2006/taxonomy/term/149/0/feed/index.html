 <title>Novel Twists, collective fictions of days gone by</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/402</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my search for online images and backgrounds for my final project, I came across a site that reminded me a lot of Shelley Jackson&#039;s Skin.  The site is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noveltwists.com/&quot;&gt;Novel Twists&lt;/a&gt;, and it basically is a piece of collaborative fiction comprised of a total of 150 pages, and people bid for the right to contribute a page.  I tried to find the ebay aunction site where this was going on, but I failed.  It&#039;s probably privatized or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this project is very similar to Jackson&#039;s Skin.  It also relies on the premise that this is a collaborative project with a limited number of participants who don&#039;t know each other.  Here, though, the participants aren&#039;t as thoroughly screened as those in Jackson&#039;s project.  Rather, the winner/writer of each page goes to the highest bidder, and then all the proceeds go to charity.  Quite an interesting way to raise money, don&#039;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Skin and Hypertext as Jigsaw Puzzles</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/371</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This might seem like I am stating the obvious, but is it just me, or does Shelley Jackson seem--in addition to being super interested in bodies, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/369&quot;&gt;Frabby&lt;/a&gt; pointed out--to also be obsessed with puzzles?  It seems like if we were to simplify the concepts behind &lt;em&gt;Skin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Patchwork Girl&lt;/em&gt;, then it would seem like Jackson is creating a giant jigsaw puzzle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html&quot;&gt;frontpage&lt;/a&gt; of Skin, I was misled into thinking that her final project was supposed to be presented as a giant collage/puzzle of the people&#039;s tattoos.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/368&quot;&gt;Pimm&lt;/a&gt; also linked us to Jackson&#039;s tatooed people&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart&quot;&gt;community blog&lt;/a&gt;, in which someone mentions that &quot;I am we,&quot; which seems like the individual does acknowledge that he or she is like a puzzle piece in a larger collective identity. Not to strip people of their humanity and say that they&#039;re/we&#039;re all puzzle pieces, but it does seem like Jackson&#039;s hinting at this concept with her work.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Life, A User&#039;s Manual</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/345</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So after I came up with my final project idea, I ran across David Bellos&#039; translation of a book by Georges Perec, a Frenchman, called &lt;em&gt;Life, A User&#039;s Manual&lt;/em&gt;.  The idea behind the book somewhat resembles the idea behind my hypertextual neighborhood-- although Perec&#039;s idea was considerably more original, considering that his book was published in 1978.  Perec examines every room in an apartment block in Paris on the evening of June 23, 1975&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several interesting aspects to this book.  For instance, despite its avant-garde structure, &lt;em&gt;Life, A User&#039;s Manual&lt;/em&gt; was both a popular and a critical success-- almost a French version of &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Online Caroline, non-guilt, Big Brother</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/295</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I first logged onto Online Caroline for about 30 seconds, looked around, thought she was a real person, and then logged out.  I thought she was just another blogger.  I was tired that night and decided to put off &quot;playing&quot; with her until the next day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I read Jill Walker&#039;s essay on Online Caroline.  It was during the reading that I realized Caroline was fake.  I &quot;spoiled&quot; the story for myself before I could even start my &quot;friendship&quot; with Caroline.  I walked into this &quot;relationship&quot; already skeptical because of Walker&#039;s analysis, and after about 10 minutes of being Caroline&#039;s &quot;friend,&quot; I was convinced this was not for me.  I echo a lot of skepticism that others, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/293&quot;&gt;crashingintowalls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/283&quot;&gt;tophat1&lt;/a&gt;,talk about in their posts.  I mentioned in some comments in other people&#039;s posts that the over-friendly tone, though aimed at making the situation believable, actually has the opposite effect.  Caroline&#039;s attempts at moving this friendship forward had a negative effect on me.  The web designer&#039;s &quot;tools&quot; of friendship, including personalized emails and a conversational, direct tone makes the &quot;player&quot; realize that this situation is forged, fake. Like other people have mentioned, the personalized email does not feel personalized--rather, it seems contrived to me.  It seems to me like the web-designers are forcing the friendship onto the participant, wanting desperately for us to buy into their scheme.  But, as many of these posts seem to suggest, it hasn&#039;t been working for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Transmedia Storytelling</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/275</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Transmedia. The future of media and gaming?  Or rather, is the future now? Henry Jenkins writes that &quot;transmedia storytelling...depends less on each individual work being self-sufficient than on each work contributing to a larger narrative economy.&quot; (124)  He includes books, film, television, comics, and other media, &quot;each doing what it does best, each a relatively autonomous experience, but the richest understanding of the story world comes to those who follow the narrative across the various channels.&quot; (124)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve asked some friends who like gaming whether they feel this is true, and they seem to think that the best games are those that don&#039;t belong to some &quot;narrative economy.&quot;  Stand-alone games that don&#039;t seem to have a narrative arch like CS and Diablo are, as we all know, really popular and it doesn&#039;t matter that there&#039;s no background story.  Video games that involve Harry Potter and other non-computer-media based characters don&#039;t do as well, in terms of sales.  Why is this?  Is the fun of the game lost in the attempt to make a videogame an accurate representation of the particular book or film?  Do the constraints of the characters&#039; book world or film world limit what the videogame player can do? Maybe I was asking an audience that just happens to not like such &quot;transmedia&quot; works, and I&#039;m making too rash of a generalization?  Still though, it seems that the most successful--and I&#039;m defining success by sales and sheer number of players worldwide--games have not been the &quot;transmedia stories&quot; but instead stand-alone videogames.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Another kind of right to contract?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/274</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been thinking about the idea of a contract between reader/player and text/story/game, which several people have made brief reference to in class and on the blog.  It&#039;s a pretty generally accepted notion that readers enter into contracts with books, and it seems equally plausible that a player enters into a contract with the game she chooses to play.  I&#039;m wondering if the contract that a reader makes with a text is substantially different from the contract a player makes with a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader expects that a story will make some sort of coherent sense (unless we&#039;re talking about highly experimental stuff)-- that she&#039;ll be able to follow along to a certain extent, that even if she doesn&#039;t understand every single paragraph, she&#039;ll be able to draw some meaning out of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Architecture, Zork, Building Worlds</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/244</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;*Spoiler Alert: If you haven&#039;t played Zork yet, proceed with caution because some of what I say in this entry will potentially &quot;spoil&quot; the story for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when I started to play Zork, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I started out in front of a white house, on the edge of a forest.  I thought this would be similar to the experience of interacting with Eliza, a simple exchange of user prompts and computer-generated responses. Boy, was I wrong.  As I found out after several hours of stumbling around in Zork-world, the white house and forest actually sit on top of an elaborate underground empire called The Great Underground Empire, complete with secret rooms and monsters to kill!&lt;/p&gt;
