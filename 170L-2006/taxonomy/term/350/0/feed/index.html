 <title>End of semester craziness</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/674</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think that much of the posting craziness that has gone on in the past few days is evidence of our collective procrastination, but I, for one, have enjoyed it quite a bit.

I&#039;m going to be a bit sad to have it gone.  I hope that you guys keep posting every now and again, even if only occasionally.  This has been a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Blogs, speed, and interactivity</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/635</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s true that the end of semester increase in post frequency has allowed for a lot of fun interaction.  It also seems that without a ton of class reading to discuss, people are making fewer monologues and are actually responding to eachother, which I think is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, we talked a lot about whether blogs were truly interactive, or whether they offered a false interactivity.  I think in these last few weeks I&#039;ve gotten a better sense of the kind of interactivity that really serious bloggers manage.  Professional bloggers often post several times a day, and when you have a group of peop&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>one more question</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/633</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the blog would look like if it was less structured.  Just kind of a free-for-all.  Length of posts, amount of posts, content of posts, all completely open.  Would that be better or worse?&lt;/p&gt;
