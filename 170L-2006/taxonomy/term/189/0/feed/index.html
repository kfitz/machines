 <title>The Onyx Project: additional software included</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/485</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few people have mentioned frustration with the &quot;for sale only&quot; nature of &quot;The Onyx Project,&quot; or in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/476&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, a desire to see the site&#039;s claims about their product in action. When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/329&quot;&gt;first suggested this reading&lt;/a&gt; a while back, I mentioned that I had a copy of the full, working product (and no, I did not pay $23.95 for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a DVD that runs out of Windows. I haven&#039;t seen the thing myself, but I&#039;m also pretty intrigued to see how this interactive not-movie plays out. If there&#039;s interest, maybe I should bring it to class Monday or Wednesday and we could all play around with it then? What does the rest of the class/the professor think?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>factoring ourselves into the equation</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/314</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in class, we discussed Jill Walker&#039;s essay and how some of us might have felt &quot;played&quot; by onlinecaroline.  We talked about how our feelings in a novel are similar or different (according to our individual perspectives).  Finally, we discussed our different feelings of voyeurism regarding the different texts.  First off, I think that there is a different interaction between reader and novel and reader and electronic text. We aren&#039;t factored into the novel at all, at least not in any literal way and we certainly aren&#039;t going to change the ending according to our action or inaction.  At least in some electronic texts we are able to change the outcome according to our choices (even if they aren&#039;t especially informed choices).&lt;/p&gt;
