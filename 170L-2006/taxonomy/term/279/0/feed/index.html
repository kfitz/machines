 <title>Changing the way the brain reads and thinks</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/444</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;m reading GAM3R 7H30RY (and let me tell you, it freaks me out that even though a part of my brain processes that it&#039;s not all standard alphabet, most of my brain reads it like perfectly normal text), and was struck by the passage on card 10: &quot;Work becomes a gamespace, but no games are freely chosen any more. Not least for children, who if they are to be the winsome offspring of win-all parents, find themselves drafted into endless evening shifts of team sport...Play becomes everything to which it was once opposed. It is work, it is serious, it is morality, it is necessity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a family that never really encouraged joining sports teams.  My father had been on a lot of teams as a kid and enjoyed it, and we were never told we *couldn&#039;t* be on teams, but it was never really pushed.  My parents felt it was more important to run around the backyard and play amongst ourselves than get caught up in the cut-throat competitiveness of suburban rec leagues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we played cards and board games for blood.&lt;/p&gt;
