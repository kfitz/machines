 <title>Immediacy in text-based games</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/261</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I have to admit that this was an enjoyable homework assignment. I left my video game habits, modest as they were, in a prior life, so the walk through memory dungeon was quite pleasant. Of course, returning to my old stomping grounds with a critical eye became an experience in itself. I played Zork long ago and far away, and at that point I had painstakingly mapped the terrain and finally bought a strategy guide to get me through a tough section that I cannot remember now, save for vague impressions of fire and ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around I was more content to wander and observe. I felt far from involved, and I watched my own reactions and the structure of the game much more than the actual play. I wanted to figure the game out, but in a totally different way than I once had. Perhaps this made it difficult to appreciate what the game brought to the table. Before my memory of command truncations and conventions kicked back in (hey, even if you never forget how to ride a bike, you may still wobble a little) I fought with the interface and reached some of the same frustrations that &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/258&quot;&gt;night owl&lt;/a&gt; did. The game felt clunky, probably as much because of my desire to pick it apart as my familiarity with more immersive environments.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The chimney is too narrow for you and all of your baggage.</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/258</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just spent a little more time with Zork than I would have liked. And I didn&#039;t kill a damn thing. Aren&#039;t we supposed to get to kill things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or steal them? That&#039;s what the HELP says, but I can&#039;t imagine any remotely entertaining (or even interesting) method of going back and forth to that first room with the trophy case. I couldn&#039;t even consistently manage to walk out of whatever room (or whatever bizarrely specific, geographically or historically incompatible location) that I was in, and then walk back into it from the exact same direction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls&lt;br /&gt;
and ceiling. There are passages to the north and east.&lt;br /&gt;
A mass of ice fills the western half of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; walk north &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream. The path&lt;br /&gt;
travels to the north and the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; walk south&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wall there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; walk north&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls&lt;br /&gt;
and ceiling. There are passages to the north and east.&lt;br /&gt;
A mass of ice fills the western half of the room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Messing with the system</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/257</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Playing with Zork was interesting, to say the least.  I could see the conflict Henry Jenkins describes in &quot;Game Design as Narrative Architecture.&quot;  He writes, &quot;Game designers struggle with this balancing act--trying to determine how much plot will create a compelling framework and how much freedom players can enjoy at a local level without totally derailing the larger narrative trajectory.  As inexperienced storytellers, they often fall back on rather mechanical exposition...&quot; (126).  With Zork, I felt the larger narrative framework was derailed...or I couldn&#039;t find it.  Like Lulu, I googled (actually, I Wikipediaed) Zork, and I&#039;m not ashamed to admit it.  There is no way I could have figured out what I was doing and even get out the trees in the dimly lit forest until Wikipedia gave me simple commands to use.  Even after I found some help sites, I still couldn&#039;t figure out what to do.  The most frustrating part was that I felt like I was following strict guidelines that weren&#039;t even told to me on how to play the game.  I repeatedly typed in responses (which I thought made sense) that caused the message &quot;I don&#039;t understand what you mean&quot; to pop up.  After seeing those over and over, I wanted to scream at the computer.  Yet, oddly enough, the pleasure of typing something that caused a positive reaction or an actual response was rewarding enough to keep me going.  However, eventually the displeasure of seeing that my responses were invalid made me play the trick that KF said user did with Eliza: come up with ridiculous responses in order to mess up the system.  This turned out to be my favorite part, because I felt like I was getting a human answer.  For instance, I was stuck in the forest behind a grating, and I typed &quot;pick up grating,&quot; to which Zork replied &quot;You can&#039;t be serious.&quot;  When I found more grating and typed &quot;jump grating&quot; (again), I got &quot;You&#039;re enjoying yourself, aren&#039;t you?&quot;  Later, when I found the bird chirping in the tree, I (for kicks, I hope I&#039;m not this violent in real life) typed &quot;kill bird.&quot;  Zork responded: &quot;I&#039;ve known strange people, but attacking a bird?&quot;  Funny stuff.  The amusing part is that enough users must have tried to input these same, weird commands or the creators of Zork suspected that there would be oddballs like me who wanted to push the game&#039;s buttons (so to speak) or they wouldn&#039;t have created those replies.  It made me want to continue just so I could see where I would get a funny reply and not simply &quot;I don&#039;t understand what you mean.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
