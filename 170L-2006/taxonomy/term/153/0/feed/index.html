 <title>Micronarratives and Background Information</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/250</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Game Design as Narrative Architecture,&quot; Henry Jenkins talks about narrative presence, in the form of previously encountered narratives as well as micronarratives, in games.  He describes certain games that involve previous knowledge.  His cites &quot;American McGee&#039;s Alice&quot; as an example of a game derived from an older story (Lewis Carroll&#039;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;).  The premise of the game is strange: years later Alice is trying to figure out of her experience of Wonderland was real or a hallucination.  Jenkins makes the point that the gamer plays against a background of previous encounters with  &quot;storybook illustrations and Disney movies.&quot; Yet, it would be quite different to draw from the Disney movie or storybook vs. Lewis Carroll&#039;s book.  The sinister feel of the game would be in much starker contrast to the Disney movie.&lt;/p&gt;
