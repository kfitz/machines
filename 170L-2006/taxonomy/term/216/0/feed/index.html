 <title>How much authority did the authors have over their work?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/347</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Web readers will have an experience closest to that of a typical hypertext reader, but even then, the presence and order of material on the site will be determined by participants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am confused by this.  From what I could gather, the authors sent out 8 packets with three sheets each to participants.  The sheets we&#039;re presented with on the webpage.  Is this implying that the participants were given sheets with random bits on them, and they put them together in what they thought was the most cohesive order, and then got back to the authors on this?  Doesn&#039;t make sense, though, since the authors say the participants will *definitely* understand the full story arc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that the participants are more...not street artist, but...made the visual and social art aspects of the story happen, and could potentially make the political statements contained in the text far stronger, but had very little bearing on the full narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
