 <title>Publishing on the Web</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/616</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blurb.com/&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; while wandering around online a little while ago.  To summarize, it&#039;s a site offering software that supposedly allows anyone to &quot;publish&quot; their own books.  While self-publishing is nothing new, the creators of this software claim that they have made it so easy as to render it trivial (alright, that second part is my claim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontpage is dominated by a rotating set of testimonials from various users.  The one that&#039;s up currently proclaims, &quot;Meet Jim, a banker. He&#039;s written three cookbooks.  This month.&quot;  One might be inclined to scoff and say, &quot;Well they weren&#039;t real books, were they?&quot;  but some poking around on the page reveals that the creators of this software offer a method to convert &quot;books&quot; made in that format into physical &quot;bookstore quality&quot; product.  And they will tell you how to do this for the low low price of 14.95.&lt;/p&gt;
