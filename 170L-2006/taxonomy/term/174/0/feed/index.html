 <title>Having a mini temper tantrum...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/343</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m going to mention this because right now it&#039;s soooooo frustrating and I simply can&#039;t not talk about it...but I just wrote a whole long blog post and then accidentally deleted it!!  And for about 30-45 seconds, I kind of lost it.  I hate that everything has to be recorded or it doesn&#039;t count.  I know what you&#039;re thinking, probably that that&#039;s a stupid comment.  It is kinda stupid because that&#039;s how everything works I guess but just know that right now I am struggling ....I could almost feel a tear slowly building... but then it went away.  Obviously I am bad at dealing with life when my attempts to do something productive are thwarted.  It&#039;s just, you know, when you did something you&#039;re supposed to do you almost feel proud, but now that&#039;s been destroyed... because you get that feeling and then you just know that whatever you type now is only going to be a crappier version of what you originally had...sigh ok enough with that.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Reading and Complicity</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/307</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I deliberately did not read Jill Walker&#039;s essay on Caroline (until 5 minutes ago) because I was hoping that I would have enough time to discover the end on my own.  But given that getting to the end apparently takes a minimum of 24 days, and that people would probably talk about the end in class today, I decided to bite the bullet and read Walker&#039;s essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was genuinely surprised at what was going to happen to Caroline-- and especially surprised at my own reaction: I felt worried and sad.  But then I asked myself why I should feel concern for someone who doesn&#039;t exist.  I felt sheepish, like I do when I cry in movies-- like, why should my emotions be so easily manipulable?  But then I realized that our culture considers it fairly acceptable to be emotionally affected by the fate of a character in a book-- or even a character in a movie or TV show.  So why not an online character, too-- especially one with whom I have communicated with far more than I have ever communicated with a character in a book, movie, or TV show?  I guess it just takes time for new media to gain legitimacy in our minds, even when what they&#039;re doing has ancient parallels.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Caroline, you can be MY friend</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/297</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like most people are pretty dissatisfied with Caroline.  Although I understand the desire for Caroline to seem lifelike, to seem like a person we would actually be friends with, I think that there are other important factors that contribute to the overall quality of an interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these is, I think, overlooked far too often, and it is this: interestingness.  I mean, yeah, I don&#039;t believe that Caroline and I are actually friends, but I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; curious about how she will resolve the tensions in her personal life, and I do look forward to receiving her emails each day, which are full of enjoyable, self-deprecating, and self-conscious banter (better than some of the &quot;real&quot; emails I receive), and I do enjoy poking around the site.  The same is not true, for me, with Jemma.  She is not very interesting.  I don&#039;t care about her date.  Or studying physics in the UK.  But Caroline has a definite personality.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wish I could be part of your world? Ummm...no thanks.</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/293</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Another first impression to go along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/291&quot;&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; on carolineonline (and to dig me out of the blog deficit that I am in. Planet Jemma did not draw me in, but I was not as negative about this one for some reason (suppose I&#039;m more into the cartoons). What was interesting about this one for me (besides the Britishisms, which I miss sorely) was the many different media that this site worked in. The &quot;first person&quot; videos, the quizzes, the emails and the voting (which apparently impacts the story line...) seem to be multiple &quot;hooks&quot; provided to get someone caught up in this story. I got the feeling that this was a rather unproductive shotgun approach that failed to achieve consistency. The surveys that I filled out instantly returned conversational responses, which felt hokey. Also, the video was contrived, complete with cliffhanger. While it lacked the &quot;creepy&quot; vibe of carolineonline, it felt unfinished and commercial in its attempts to pull me in.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Caroline and Jemma</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/288</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know why, but I just have to force myself to be anything more than the tiniest bit interested in the stories at &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinecaroline.com/&quot;&gt;onlinecaroline.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://planetjemma.com/&quot;&gt;planetjemma.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Having to put in my email address already makes me cranky, and thinking about getting emails from these sites makes me realize that I will probably do what I do with all other emails, which is leave them piling up unread for as long as possible while I assure myself I will read them later.  I don&#039;t know what it is...I&#039;m still trying to figure out my stubborn resistance to it all.  Something about getting these standard responses to my interactions with the characters...  I don&#039;t really want to fill in my personal details and answer quizzes so I can get these limited replies...won&#039;t it probably just come down to how much I can mess with the format and try to get unique responses?  I haven&#039;t read through all of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; yet, but I&#039;m immediatly more interested in it.  Reading something that I can pretend is personal and real is more captivating for me than reading emails that are trying to make you think they&#039;re personal and real because, really, all their trying does is make it more obvious that they&#039;re not what they&#039;re trying to be.  Does that make sense?  These are my early impressions so who knows, maybe I&#039;ll get more drawn into the stories of &quot;Caroline&quot; and &quot;Jemma&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
