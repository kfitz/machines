 <title>Virtual Anarchy and Facade</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/264</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Listening in class, I was relieved to hear that I wasn&#039;t the only one who found it irresistable to push the limits of Facade (trying for kisses, to turn the argument violent, threesomes, asking for more and more drinks etc.)  What interests me here is how players attempt to rebel against the freedom they are given in a game like Facade.  Rather than trying to complete the game the urge is to romp around within in it trying to come up with outcomes that seem the furthest from what the creators intended.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Facade</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/249</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just downloaded and played Facade and I must say it&#039;s every bit as creepy as I imagined a game about trying to keep a couple together/break them apart would be.  Their facial expressions, the way they tend to interpret innocuous comments made by my character (Ray) as weirdly innapropriate advances, or at least divisive in nature, and how they get mad at not only each other, but also me with no warning.  For example, during an awkward silence I made the mistake of mentioning the view, which caused Grace to flip out about how people are always talking about the view.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relative nature of Facade struck me as very un-game like.&lt;/p&gt;
