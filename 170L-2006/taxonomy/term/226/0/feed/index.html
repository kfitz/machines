 <title>Skin and Elitism</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/363</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am almost unnerved by how furious the basic conceit of Skin makes me.  Apart from the cult-like nature of Jackson&#039;s recruitment methods (Hey kids! Get an inane tattoo, in book font mind you, and I&#039;ll tell you the real story!), the idea of a text that you basically need to join a club to read is the height of elitism.  I suppose if one accepts the whole indie mentality of obscurity as the highest good, then one might be inclined to be really excited about this.  Not that I really have any right to tell Shelley Jackson how to express herself, but it seems to me that the goal of art should be to spread one&#039;s work as far as possible, to reach as many people as possible.  I find it hilarious that Shelley Jackson has managed to practically pull this off, and is getting attention for an experiment without any accessible content to back it up.  Let&#039;s just hope that the scientologists don&#039;t catch wind of this one.  That said, the one thing that I do admire about Skin is the way that the &quot;words&quot; are free to express their own interpretations of their tattoos on Skin&#039;s website.  At least they get some input here.&lt;/p&gt;
