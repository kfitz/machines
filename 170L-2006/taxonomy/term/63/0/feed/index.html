 <title>Interaction</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/187</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I read through the class blog, I see a lot about interaction including interaction between reader and writer, fellow bloggers, and even people looking for a date online.  Also, in our reading there is the perpetual theme of book vs. electronic literature and how our interactions differ from medium to medium.  As much as we are able to &quot;interact&quot; with the stories we read in the hypertexts, for example, there is an important physicality that is missing.  I feel less connected with literature I read off the computer screen, perhaps because it seems like a barrier.&lt;br /&gt;
    For those of you who have had the pleasure of taking the GRE recently, you&#039;ll know that the reading comprehension sections are now on the computer.  After studying for it and taking it this summer, I was glad to be finished with the severe annoyance of reading and trying to fully comprehend something off of a computer screen where you can&#039;t underline words or sentences you like or find important.  You are even restricted in the angle at which you look at the text (because it&#039;s on a computer screen).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Interaction as an Artistic Goal</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/185</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve spent a fair amount of time discussing the interactive aspect of electronic literature, and the way that this manifests itself in blogs and hypertexts.  It strikes me as ironic that while some in the literary community are so interested in developing an interactive text, this tends to be more frowned on in film and theater.  In film, it is considered cheesy when characters speak either directly to the camera or to a voiceover narrator (a la &quot;Donald Duck in Mathmagicland&quot;).  In theater, it is generally frowned upon to &quot;break the fourth wall&quot; by speaking to the audience.  I am aware that t&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A book&#039;s interactivity</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/73</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reading the Burnett selection, I was struck more by his attempts to make his book interactive than the actual ideas.  We discussed this idea in the context of &quot;We&#039;ve Got Blog&quot; a bit, mainly dealing with the fact that readers have different expectations for bound books than they do for internet content.  One of the key differences between these media, of course, was that a blog or another form of internet writing was usually interactive, in that users could comment on the blog and question it, and that a book cannot really be questioned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnett encourages readers to question his book, providing a link (well, a web-address anyway), and invites readers to join in the discussion.  I followed the &lt;a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
