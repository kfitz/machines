 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been reading bits and pieces of Jay David Bolter&#039;s book &quot;Writing Space&quot; and I&#039;ve come across some interesting and helpful articles relating to many of our class discussions and readings.  In his book, he writes a section on the gap between the thing represented and the represented sign and our desire to break through this gap.  In a later section entitled &quot;Perception and Semiosis,&quot; he continues the discussion by talking about the networks of signs we encounter on the computer.  He believes many people attribute perception to computers, or are at least trying to create create computers with programs that display perceptual characteristics.  Bolter rejects the idea that computers are in the realm of perception and states that computer literacy is semiotic (it involves systems of reading and writing signs).&lt;/p&gt;
