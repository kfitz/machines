 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was looking for election results and was really frustrated because I could not find them anywhere via Google.  It wasn&#039;t until I found &lt;A href=&quot;http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/061108-041714&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/A&gt; discussing who had the best coverage of the election, which did a major put-down of Google, and praised Yahoo, that it occurred to me &quot;Hey, wait, right, there *are* other search engines.&quot;  And apparently they haven&#039;t all become powered by Google, as I remember them being a few years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s so weird to me, I remember back in middle school, being taught how to use the internet, having a list of a dozen different search engines to check, and then came Google, the search to end all searches.  I guess I&#039;m finally starting to see through the hype and things are correcting themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
