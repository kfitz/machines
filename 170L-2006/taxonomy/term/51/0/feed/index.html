 <title>Spam on a blog</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/652</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amusing to me, as well, the volume of posts that have recently hit this site.  Not that I&#039;m one to point fingers.  It feels almost like we&#039;ve spammed the blog.  Now, I&#039;m not saying that our posts are irrelevant advertisements for penis enlargement.  I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s more along the lines of there are so many posts, with so many creative and possibly concealing names, that you can&#039;t possibly go through and read all the new ones.  It&#039;s just like when your email box gets a zillion new messages and you give up on trying to sort through them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s kind of like when Magoo was posting his fiction on the blog.  That stuff was really interesting, but the volume at which it came overwhelmed the rest of the blog posts and made reading anything but it somewhat of a search.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Nightmare</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/457</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few nights ago, I dreamt that I was watching my friends play video games (yeah I know, pretty exciting), and the violence in the game was so intense that I was paralyzed with fear. The fear only intensified as some of my friends began killing each other, and the game I was watching suddenly jumped out of the screen, until we were all either hiding or caught up in the killing frenzy. In the midst of all this terror, I thought, &quot;this is something I could blog about. Violence in games really does spill over to violence in real life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, that&#039;s an odd reaction to have in the middle of a violent nightmare. And when I woke up the next day, I was pretty sad to realize that I didn&#039;t have a blog post about violence in games.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Frankenblog . . . is another portmanteau</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;tophat1&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/55&quot;&gt;Technology and the Future&lt;/a&gt; post got me thinking (as did the fact that I was tophat1&#039;s discussion partner, which is why this is a blog post and not a comment)... One of Ong&#039;s basic points is that writing is a technology. So it is subject to the same good-or-bad evaluations that might be made about our newer, shinier, electronic technology. Accordingly, there is a fair amount of heady stuff written by important people (Ong mentions Plato, Rousseau and Derrida, among others) about whether writing is a good technology or a bad one. Writing gets credit from Ong, at the very least, for having &quot;transformed human consciousness&quot; (77).&lt;/p&gt;
