 <title>Variations on Blue</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/330</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, talking in class Monday about &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; triggered a bunch of thoughts that I shall attempt to present coherently, but no promises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~Was &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; originally emailed?&lt;br /&gt;
~What impact does seeing it all at once instead of in controlled installments have?&lt;br /&gt;
~What&#039;s that &quot;after Blue Company by Rob Wittig&quot; on the bottom of the main entrance page?&lt;br /&gt;
~I wonder how an email novel would work on the page?&lt;br /&gt;
~Hey, I read one of those years ago, time to look up &quot;Exegesis&quot; and share it with y&#039;all.&lt;br /&gt;
~Hmm, not quite what I remember, but still worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;
~There&#039;s this other writing project called Exegesis that I&#039;m just starting to poke and I&#039;m not sure what I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;
~The lack of a completely standardized keyboard (while I understand it&#039;s for issues of space) really irks me, because the muscle memory when I try to use the page up, page down, end &amp;amp; home keys often results in nasty things happening.&lt;br /&gt;
~Aesthetically, I really like ~&lt;/p&gt;
