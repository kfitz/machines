 <title>sunday nights</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been overthinking things for as long as I can remember.  I overthink the fact that I overthink everything.  I analyze absolutely everything and come up with these explanations of why I subconsciously didn&#039;t do what I said I was going to do or what someone really meant when they said something to me.  Buying things involves a very complicated process of very, very carefully weighing out all the pros and cons and selecting the exact item I want.  If I don&#039;t have enough time to go through this complicated process, it&#039;s hard to feel...satisfied. Thinking is good but thinking, hard indulgent thinking, about your life and why this happened and what you would say if you could go back in time and what you should be doing and what other people think about you...it&#039;s all f*cking exhausting.  I&#039;ve been thinking (ha) about why it&#039;s so hard for me to write in here sometimes...I find myself thinking about the blog more than ever actually doing things with it.  (And I use too many ...&#039;s).  My complete inability to just do, act, write is kind of a problem.  This blog isn&#039;t a place where I could just sit down any day of the week and write about what I&#039;m feeling at that very moment or how someone in a crowd puked, just a little, on my leg last night or how my sister keeps leaving me messages with her cat meowing into the phone followed by a &quot;snufflebunny says hello!&quot; or &quot;emmybemmybear wants to say hi!&quot; comment.  This blog has a strange mix of academic and personal and I can&#039;t always figure out what to do.  It&#039;s hard for me to write first reactions to material and first thoughts because you always have to be checking yourself-- does this make sense (making sense is obviously not always an easy task), did someone else already say this in a more concise and coherent way, am I going to completely change my mind once I read that article I haven&#039;t printed out yet...and then I just get bogged down in it all. I suppose I really just need to get over it.  This is really more of a self-indulgent whining post than a post that &quot;matters&quot; so to speak...Sunday nights get me in a certain mood (the line that always comes to me is from these stories that I used to read when I was little that were about this badger named Frances and her viewpoint of the world...&quot;Homework sits on top of Sunday, squashing Sunday flat&quot;)  But yeah, the academic stuff will come later tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
