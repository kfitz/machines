 <title>Content in GAM3R 7H30RY, new video game consoles</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/452</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I talked a little before about &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/451&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; in GAM3R 7H30RY, and now I wanted to comment a little on the actual content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading the first few chapters in the &quot;book,&quot; but as the author started getting overly theoretical with his ideas and new words like agon, alea, heterotopia, and atopia, I had a difficult time following along.  I thought it was interesting that McKenzie chose to talk about these ideas in such an extensive manner and didn&#039;t actually concretely define what he meant by each term until the &lt;em&gt;fifth&lt;/em&gt; section, &quot;Atopia.&quot;  By then, he starts defining alea as &quot;chance&quot; and agon as &quot;competition,&quot; (card 115) and I literally had to write down all his definitions and constanty refer to them in order to remind myself of what he was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
