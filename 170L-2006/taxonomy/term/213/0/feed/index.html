 <title>My project</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/569</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the great presentations today!  It&#039;s fun to see how varied everyone&#039;s are.  This is just a short post, asking if anyone wants to give feedback on my project, you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://writingmachines.livejournal.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I may not get to them immediately, but believe me...I will eventually, and they are much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I really appreciated all the in-class comments.  Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>oh!  I should do this too!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/538</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Being the second entry in the category of shameless plug isn&#039;t quite as exciting as the first, but here goes--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d love (and indeed, need) input on my own blog.  It&#039;s about (importantly enough) collaborative authorship/writing.  Here&#039;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/projects/marmalade&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#039;t have to read the whole thing--just glance at a post or two and leave me a comment if it&#039;s not too much trouble.  You&#039;ll be joining the exalted ranks of those like McKenzie Wark!  (I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a good incentive, but it&#039;s a try.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you a million--I know that&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Make my project happen!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/537</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my final project depends &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; on a community that will participate in it. As a member of the Writing Machines community, I want to ask you to help me. Rather than telling you a lot about my concept, I&#039;d prefer to let you try it for yourself and talk to me about it later. Seriously, it will take 10 minutes of your time, and it just might be fun. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlineintheworld.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Did anyone else feel like they were subscribing to spam?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/344</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, I check my inbox, and there&#039;s an email with the title &quot;FW: your bum!&quot; and i had a really bad knee-jerk reaction.  Part of this may have been I&#039;d just been to my lj friends page, where rampant discussion was going on about females and objectification and sexism prompted in part by an op-ed piece in the NYTimes, thus much fur was flying and people being rubbed the wrong way as a very diverse group of men and women weighed in and got into a very ugly, highly charged mess on objectification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, kneejerk reaction i did have to Jemma&#039;s latest email.  It took me a moment to register that it was from planet Jemma, not just some bit of (rather British) spam for hott sexxx with girlnextdoorsbum. com opps delete the space before com :)  (or, i suppose, since it was *my* bum in question, friendlyanalsexxxwithproperbrits. com)  which, with its &quot;hello!&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;Re: your question&quot; and &quot;Wrgkwekg&quot; subject lines, really doesn&#039;t bother me.  What got to me about Jemma, about the whole way emails from her website and the &quot;people&quot; affiliated with it were-- i had to go through and read all the emails that i thought were spam, because it *might* be something for class from someone I&#039;ve never heard of, about some subject I don&#039;t know about because I didn&#039;t know Jamie was &quot;Desperately seeking attractive intelligent women to appear in my TV pilot.&quot;  It felt a lot more intrusive and irritating than the emails from Caroline and her ilk, because those had the sender as the email address, so I could see &quot;Ah, it&#039;s related to that website I&#039;m working with for class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
