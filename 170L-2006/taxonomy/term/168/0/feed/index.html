 <title>Attention Economy</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/673</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two articles necessary for this blog entry (and anyone interested in modern internet theory in general): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in a previous post that not everyone has the privilege of being heard. This differs in a pre-digital society, in which if you had the ability to speak, people had to hear you (barring earplugs or a hurricane). In a digital society, everyone has the ability to speak, but getting heard is a completely different project. For example, in order to speak on Slashdot (the infamous techie hub), one must only login and comment. After a comment has been made, however, that comment is assessed by other users and is assigned an evolving numerical rank from -1 to 5 (-1 being flamebait, 5 being very good). Comments can reach a 5 on different merits -- informative, funny, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Attention spa--ooo, look, pretty pebble!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/279</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was hanging around with a friend last night, poking about on the internet (the fact that surfing the net is social activity...can of worms I&#039;m not going to tackle at the moment), and found a youtube video someone had linked to.  Nothing particularly profound or interesting, an upload of a music* video, about 4 minutes long.  The song was repetitive and the concept behind the video revealed itself very quickly, and I soon lost interest.  My friend made a comment about short attention span.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s that I never really &quot;got in to&quot; to the whole music videos thing, or that as part of the post-mtv generation, my attention cannot be held by even the shortest of sustained stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
