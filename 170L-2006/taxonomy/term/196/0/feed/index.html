 <title>Google&#039;s &quot;designs on the web 2.0 market&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/321</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this &lt;a href=&quot;http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9075-2430810,00.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; today proclaiming that Google just purchased Jotspot, one of the wiki sites KF recommended I look into as a forum for a final project.  The lead of the article states that this was the latest step in Google&#039;s &quot;designs on the web 2.0 market.&quot;  I don&#039;t know exactly what this means, but it sounds like Google is trying to monopolize the programs it thinks will be influential in the next generation of web interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Krauss, the co-founder of Jotspot, was excited by the deal. &quot;We watched them acquire Writely, and launch Google Groups, Google Spreadsheets and Google Apps for Your Domain. It was pretty apparent that Google shared our vision for how groups of people can create, manage and share information online,&quot; he said. While it is apparent that Google can use it&#039;s resources to increase the usefulness and availability of programs, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m so excited by the prospect of a Google monopoly over the web 2.0 market.  Part of it is my old-fashioned fear of any kind of monopoly, but I also think it could lead to an over-centralization and homogenization of web resources.  I&#039;d be curious to hear what the more tech-savvy among you think.&lt;/p&gt;
