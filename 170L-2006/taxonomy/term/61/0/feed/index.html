 <title>Hypertexting the classics</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/172</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago, I was searching for an online version of Alexander Pope&#039;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; for my Enlightenment Literature class (death to overpriced anthologies!), when I came across a hypertext version&lt;br /&gt;
(http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~sconstan) of the poem.  While not a very extensively annotated version of the text, it provides in a form sort of like a wiki links to explanations of language in the text and allusions, as well as visual representations of some of the scenes in the poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of Landow&#039;s idea that hypertext has been latent in literature for a long time owing to such things as allusions.  Not only does this online edition of Pope&#039;s work utilize the capabilities of its medium to make annotation easier, but it also effectively makes Pope&#039;s poem a multimedia, visual experience. In a way, it literalizes the associations that the reader draws in the course of reading.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A writer&#039;s blog</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/70</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/&quot;&gt;Neil Gaiman&#039;s Blog&lt;/a&gt; for a few days now, and I&#039;m struck by the unique attitude that he, as an already established writer, seems to take toward his blog (he calls it a &quot;journal&quot; for one thing).  It&#039;s an odd combination of the mundane and personal, personal promotion, and a method for his readers to contact him.  For example, today&#039;s entry starts out with his iTunes installation woes, progresses to a whole list of links (including an interview he did recently), and ends with him answering a reader&#039;s note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting about the blog is that he seems to &quot;let his hair down&quot; a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
