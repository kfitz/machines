 <title>Agency</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/260</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of the theory we&#039;ve been reading lately about games has attributed a good-sized share of the &quot;immersiveness&quot; of video games to the notion of agency in that we&#039;re not being pulled along by the capriciousness of authorial intent, but are rather able to freely explore within the boundaries of the game system.  Having grown up on games with interfaces sophisticated enough, or at least designed well enough to at least project the illusion of transparency, I found the experience of playing Adventure, and to a lesser extent Zork, to be incredibly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface for these games is so incredibly primitive that I did not feel a sense of immersion at all, except for a fleeting 3 minutes or so with Zork where it was all working, and the computer was not mysteriously denying my eminently reasonable requests.  It became easier as I grew somewhat acclimated to the system and what it could and could not do, but every few minutes, I would make what I thought was a common-sense command, and have it rebuffed.  Bang.  Immersion shattered.  For example, during most of my time spent with Adventure, I was being pursued through the damn catacombs by a dwarf who would throw &quot;tiny knives&quot; at me and then retreat whenever he got bored.  I had an axe at the time, so I tried to use it on the little freak.  No dice.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so I&#039;m trying to play Adventure.  Rather enjoying this next week&#039;s assignments, great procrastinations.  In theory, that is.  In practice, this is utterly infuriating.  I am not a gamer in the slightest.  I know very little about any computer games, save solitaire and 8+ year old &quot;educational&quot; games, except they usually look kinda pretty, and are apparently addictive.  The extent of my knowledge of video games is being jiggly puff while my friends play smash brothers and i stand on edges, watching my little guy wave his arms around trying to maintain balance while everyone else beats the blazes out of one another (the one time I won this way, they wouldn&#039;t let me play again all night).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know how this whole game thing is meant to work.  And quite frankly it&#039;s really ticking me off.  It doesn&#039;t make sense!  Help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case and Point:&lt;/p&gt;
