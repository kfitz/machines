 <title>Did anyone else feel like they were subscribing to spam?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/344</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, I check my inbox, and there&#039;s an email with the title &quot;FW: your bum!&quot; and i had a really bad knee-jerk reaction.  Part of this may have been I&#039;d just been to my lj friends page, where rampant discussion was going on about females and objectification and sexism prompted in part by an op-ed piece in the NYTimes, thus much fur was flying and people being rubbed the wrong way as a very diverse group of men and women weighed in and got into a very ugly, highly charged mess on objectification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, kneejerk reaction i did have to Jemma&#039;s latest email.  It took me a moment to register that it was from planet Jemma, not just some bit of (rather British) spam for hott sexxx with girlnextdoorsbum. com opps delete the space before com :)  (or, i suppose, since it was *my* bum in question, friendlyanalsexxxwithproperbrits. com)  which, with its &quot;hello!&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;Re: your question&quot; and &quot;Wrgkwekg&quot; subject lines, really doesn&#039;t bother me.  What got to me about Jemma, about the whole way emails from her website and the &quot;people&quot; affiliated with it were-- i had to go through and read all the emails that i thought were spam, because it *might* be something for class from someone I&#039;ve never heard of, about some subject I don&#039;t know about because I didn&#039;t know Jamie was &quot;Desperately seeking attractive intelligent women to appear in my TV pilot.&quot;  It felt a lot more intrusive and irritating than the emails from Caroline and her ilk, because those had the sender as the email address, so I could see &quot;Ah, it&#039;s related to that website I&#039;m working with for class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
