 <title>reality TV</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know what it is - maybe it&#039;s the much-beloved finale of Project Runway coming up, or maybe it&#039;s the article I read in the TSL about Survivor&#039;s new season, but I keep coming back to reality television somehow connecting with what we&#039;ve been talking about.  The rise of the two media at about the same time makes me think there HAS to be some sort of correlation, if not causation, then at least a similar niche being filled.

 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/42</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;In fact, television and the World Wide Web are engaged in an unacknowledged competition in which each now seeks to remediate the other.  The competition is economic as well as aesthetic; it is a struggle to determine whether broadcast television or the Internet will dominate American and world markets.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Bolter and Grusin, p. 48&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was written in 1999 - the explosion of reality tv started in 2001 with Survivor.  Is the reality genre tv&#039;s way of getting back at the web by using the web&#039;s most valuable asset - immediacy, and to a lesser extent, immersion - to revamp its image?  Is the real&lt;/p&gt;
