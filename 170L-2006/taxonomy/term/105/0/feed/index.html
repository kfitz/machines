 <title>Stepping Outside</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/659</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the appendix to his final project, &quot;Art Between Worlds,&quot; crashingintowalls remarks: &lt;cite&gt;I struggle with the fact that much of the creativity present online draws energy from the embodied world but feels no compunction to reinvest in it, hyperlinking and posting comments instead.&lt;/cite&gt; I find this comment very apposite to my present situation; that is, after a morning spent sitting here working on ideas for blog and wiki stuff, for thesis stuff -- and let&#039;s be honest -- weeks spent drawing heavily on all my word-related sources of creativity, I hit yet another of those walls where I realized that I couldn&#039;t write anymore, no less think anymore, until I stepped out into the world, exposed my ever-paler skin to the winter sunshine, and rediscovered the type of human contact that does not occur through a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>this class</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/628</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Oz kind of touched on this topic earlier, but there are some things I&#039;ve been thinking about lately in terms of the nature of this class.  On this blog we use anonymous names, but of course we all know/could figure out who&#039;s who.  We saw presentations of people&#039;s final projects and can also clink on links to see all of their content whenever we like.  We can look at who&#039;s updating the wiki and who made what editorial changes.  There&#039;s something about the way this class is set up that lets people get to know more about each other, and to make judgments, whether correct or not.  Most classes you just sort of drift through without really getting a sense of who other people are or what they&#039;re interested in, but not this class--I feel like I&#039;ve seen certain parts of people&#039;s personalities coming through their academic work.  And what&#039;s interesting to me is that this new level of interaction (or at least it&#039;s new for me) is facilitated by the internet and the online communities we&#039;ve created.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Loneliness and the Internet</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/149</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been stuck on this quote: &quot;I am afraid that one of the things that makes the web in its current form so attractive is that so many of us are afraid and lonely and do not know what to think or who will hear us&quot; (from Joyce&#039;s &quot;Othermindedness&quot; p52).  I&#039;ve been thinking about the theme of loneliness lately in connection with people who create content and put it on the web where it can be seen by a potentially huge audience.  Why do people post intensely personal diaries of their life and why do people want to read them?  Why do people want other people they&#039;ve never met before to know mundane little details of their daily lives--where they went to eat, what they bought at Target, what song they&#039;re listening to while they&#039;re writing their entry?  Maybe because these things all say something about the person who is reporting them; they convey some kind of information the writer wants you to acknowledge.  But why do we want to acknowledge this information, to get some brief grasp on how somebody else lives their life, to speculate about what some teenage girl&#039;s life is like as with the whole Lonelygirl thing?&lt;/p&gt;
