 <title>Schemas that talk</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/310</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing a thesis on Henry James.  At the beginning of this semester, I was talking with one of my thesis readers, and she recommended that, during this year, I try to be thinking about James with every paper I write.  She said this, and I felt myself do the thing -- wide eyes and two or three quick head nods -- that means interest and assent, all the while thinking, &quot;Is she nuts?  I wouldn&#039;t even know how to try, and anyway, thinking that much about James would be deadly.&quot;  The weird thing, as it turns out, is that I didn&#039;t have to try.  Looking back on what I&#039;ve written so far this semester, everything -- be it on a poem by Lewis Carroll, William Blake, a syllogistic proof, or this blog -- has been processing some Jamesian thematic or another.  Or maybe I&#039;ve just learned to see it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is partly to do with why I&#039;ve been thinking, lately, about Douglas and Hargadon&#039;s discussion of schema theory.  Not only do these schematics help me to think about the way my own mind is working, but they also apply to a whole lot of what we seem to be trying to process in this class and on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
