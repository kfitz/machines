 <title>Skin and Hypertext as Jigsaw Puzzles</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/371</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This might seem like I am stating the obvious, but is it just me, or does Shelley Jackson seem--in addition to being super interested in bodies, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/369&quot;&gt;Frabby&lt;/a&gt; pointed out--to also be obsessed with puzzles?  It seems like if we were to simplify the concepts behind &lt;em&gt;Skin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Patchwork Girl&lt;/em&gt;, then it would seem like Jackson is creating a giant jigsaw puzzle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first looked at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html&quot;&gt;frontpage&lt;/a&gt; of Skin, I was misled into thinking that her final project was supposed to be presented as a giant collage/puzzle of the people&#039;s tattoos.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/368&quot;&gt;Pimm&lt;/a&gt; also linked us to Jackson&#039;s tatooed people&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart&quot;&gt;community blog&lt;/a&gt;, in which someone mentions that &quot;I am we,&quot; which seems like the individual does acknowledge that he or she is like a puzzle piece in a larger collective identity. Not to strip people of their humanity and say that they&#039;re/we&#039;re all puzzle pieces, but it does seem like Jackson&#039;s hinting at this concept with her work.&lt;/p&gt;
