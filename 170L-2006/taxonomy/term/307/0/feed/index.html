 <title>Publishing Networked Books</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/544</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;em&gt;GAM3R 7H30RY&lt;/em&gt; and talking to marmalade yesterday about publishing networked writing in print, I&#039;ve started thinking a lot more about authorship as it relates to the transfer of online-to-print material.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, lately I&#039;ve started thinking about the publishing industry since graduation is looming, and in particular, I was curious about publishing writings from compilations such as slambooks.  What if somebody wanted to publish a childhood slambook?  Who gets the credit--the person who took the initiative and went through the formalities/procedures to getting the actual book published, or would there be some sort of &quot;thank you to Mrs. C&#039;s sixth grade class of 1996&quot;?  I think a year or two ago, when I was in an Urban Outfitters store, I saw a book that was basically a collection of some random guy&#039;s middle school notes that he passed around behind the teacher&#039;s back when he was twelve.  He&#039;d saved all those notes and then published them in a book.  I can&#039;t remember if he credited his classmates or other note writers.  I remembered this example again when we read &lt;em&gt;GAM3R 7H30RY&lt;/em&gt; and all these issues about credit and authorship came up again.&lt;/p&gt;
