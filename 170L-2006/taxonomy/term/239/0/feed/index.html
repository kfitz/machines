 <title>more on Skin</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/381</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;ve been thinking a lot lately about Skin and the one-word tattoos and people&#039;s postings.  Here&#039;s where I&#039;m getting tripped up...ok she could have potentially asked that volunteers get sentences, paragraphs, pages, or even the whole text, I suppose, tattooed on their body.  If someone copied one of the volunteer&#039;s tattoos, their tattoo would be seen as a copy, a reprinting of Jackson&#039;s work.  But words are different...if someone copied someone&#039;s tattoo of a word you would not even necessarily assume that they were &quot;copying&quot; someone, and that word would not be seen as a reprinting of Jackson&#039;s work.  Single words can&#039;t be claimed by single authors (although I guess you can make up a new word and take credit for it).&lt;/p&gt;
