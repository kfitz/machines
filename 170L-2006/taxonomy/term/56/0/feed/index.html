 <title>ruhh ruhhh RUHHH ZING!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/649</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;That is the sound my computer is making as of late.  Ruh, ruh, ruh, zing.  But more animated, like in the title of the post.  It gets all slow and confused and then explorer.exe starts taking up the entire CPU and it makes that noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I expect any of you to be able to fix it, as this thing is going on 4 years old and is probably about to hit the pasture, but wouldn&#039;t it be cool if things could be fixed by the sounds still?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like back in the day, when the people o&#039; yore would take their automobile into the shop and be like, &quot;Doc (they were always Doc), the car&#039;s got a problem.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;What sound&#039;s it making?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>online finals</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/622</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My suitemate is taking econ up at Harvey Mudd, and I asked her earlier today about her final.  I know she&#039;s been studying for it, so I was being polite and asking when her suffering would be over (ie. the final time).&lt;br /&gt;
I was pretty surprised to hear &quot;tonight at 6,&quot; knowing the structure of exam times during finals week.  How could her exam be at night?  Was Harvey Mudd on crack?&lt;br /&gt;
No, it turned out, not in this sense.  Harvey Mudd is online.  It seems as if an increasing number of their courses (according to my friend) have their final exams through some internet moderator site that does these things.  They employ the honor system to assume you won&#039;t be using anything but the allowed notes, and then set a time for everyone to take it, in this case, 6 pm, and the site times the test.  It quits the application after the allotted amount of time is up.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>projects, more video games, attitude toward blogs</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/572</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple things--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Everybody&#039;s projects are amazing and I&#039;m so impressed with everyone&#039;s work over the course of the semester.  It&#039;s really cool being able to see what exactly everyone&#039;s been occupied with over the last two months.  Would it be possible to make one post with links to everyone&#039;s projects?  And to keep that post at the top of this class blog so that it&#039;s accessible all the time? (one thing that&#039;s always annoyed me about blogs is that if it&#039;s an active blog, then you have to keep clicking &quot;next page&quot; to get to fairly recent posts because everyone posts so much) So is there a way to put everyone&#039;s projects in a single post and keep it on the front page?  I definitely want to take time to explore more during my own time.  I like everyone&#039;s projects so much that I feel like we deserve to be mentioned in the institute for the future of the book or some other techie world site, because it&#039;d be cool to share beyond our class.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>being pc, or the environment changing the virtual world</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/61</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It used to be a garbage bin, didn&#039;t it?  The recycling bin?  Where you throw away your files that you don&#039;t need/want anymore?&lt;br /&gt;
When did it change, and was that a product of political correctness about the ways we deal with garbage in the environment?&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, it doesn&#039;t really make sense to change it otherwise.  You can&#039;t so much...recycle files.  When you get rid of the info, you&#039;re trashing it.  It&#039;s over.  Then again, it doesn&#039;t go to a virtual landfill.  Maybe it should be called the incinerator bin.  But then we&#039;d have to have virtual air pollution.&lt;br /&gt;
Sigh.  This isn&#039;t going to work, is i&lt;/p&gt;
