 <title>Intersections between classes: Blogs and zines</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/555</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I love when, near the end of the semester, I begin see connections between materials in my different classes that I never thought I would find.  This recently happened to me in my &quot;Women&#039;s Magazines and the Female Journalist&quot; class at CMC when we learned about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine&quot;&gt;zines&lt;/a&gt;.  Although it&#039;s difficult to describe what zines are in one sentence, they are typically self published, not-for-profit magazines, and, in the context of my CMC class, we learned about zines written by and for girls.  I knew nothing about zines--I don&#039;t even think I had heard the term before coming to my class--but I immediately saw many intersections between them and blogs.  Although zines are still flourishing, it seems like blogs are becoming the zines of today.  Both pride themselves in allowing users to &quot;speak&quot; (or write) in an informal, unpolished, and more &quot;natural&quot; way.  They are real voices (as much as printed words can represent a voice), and, in both, the writers are very open and honest.&lt;/p&gt;
