 <title>Cassie is...</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Fine!  It is possible that pseudo is going to kill me for this, but I suspect the class will revolt if the secret is not revealed.  I&#039;m not sure that the person wants their name posted on this blog, so I&#039;ll just say this:  On pseudo&#039;s project page, there is a section on possible suspects.  One possible suspect is described as having their fingerprints all over this.  That person was the main initiator of the Cassie prank.  Said lead prankster had help from several individuals, most of them on the suspect list.  Crashingintowalls and I both knew the identity of the prankster, and I fear that a couple of joking suggestions I made were actually implemented (the &quot;You don&#039;t care about me!&quot; letter, among others).&lt;/p&gt;
