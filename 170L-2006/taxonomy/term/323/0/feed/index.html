 <title>Online Identity in Ender&#039;s Game</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/596</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is something about finals week that makes me want nothing more than to hunt down my favorite children&#039;s books as a way to relax in between bouts of studying.  In keeping with this goal, I borrowed the Orson Scott Card novel &lt;em&gt;Ender&#039;s Game&lt;/em&gt; from a neighbor.  Then I remembered the storyline in which 12-year-old Peter and 10-year-old Valentine plot to take over the world.  Their first step in their plan is to publish their writings on &quot;the nets&quot; using false names and adult personas.  Take a look at the following passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They stayed away from the nets that required use of a real name.  That wasn&#039;t hard because real names only had to do with money.  They didn&#039;t need money.  They needed respect, and that they could earn.  With false names, on the right nets, they could be anybody.  Old men, middle-aged women, anybody, as long as they were careful about the way they wrote.  All that anyone would see were their words, their ideas.  Every citizen started equal on the nets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I ran around with a camera (a contraption I truly despise, both because I don&#039;t like people using it on me, and I don&#039;t like the way it tends to distrupt social flow).  I needed a whole lot of pictures of faces for a final project for a class.  Most of the weekend, I was in various parts of LA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really interesting, the different responses I got from people.&lt;/p&gt;
