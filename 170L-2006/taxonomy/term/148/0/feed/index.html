 <title>Aha! A video game review in mainstream media!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/276</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;How appropriate! Just when we were all lamenting over the lack of videogame reviews in the media, I open up my browser and lo and behold! a videogame review appears on the frontpage of my city&#039;s online newspaper site!  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com&quot;&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; occasionally reviews videogames using the same rating system that they use for films.  The clapping man jumping out of his theater seat is a sign that the video game is super awesome.  Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/24/DDGSCLTG6F1.DTL&quot;&gt;this videogame review&lt;/a&gt; rates this new videogame called Bully. This is an &quot;immersive boarding school experience&quot; where you have to play &quot;Tough kid Jimmy&quot; whose &quot;weapons of choice were itching powder and wedgies.&quot; Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Transmedia Storytelling</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/275</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Transmedia. The future of media and gaming?  Or rather, is the future now? Henry Jenkins writes that &quot;transmedia storytelling...depends less on each individual work being self-sufficient than on each work contributing to a larger narrative economy.&quot; (124)  He includes books, film, television, comics, and other media, &quot;each doing what it does best, each a relatively autonomous experience, but the richest understanding of the story world comes to those who follow the narrative across the various channels.&quot; (124)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve asked some friends who like gaming whether they feel this is true, and they seem to think that the best games are those that don&#039;t belong to some &quot;narrative economy.&quot;  Stand-alone games that don&#039;t seem to have a narrative arch like CS and Diablo are, as we all know, really popular and it doesn&#039;t matter that there&#039;s no background story.  Video games that involve Harry Potter and other non-computer-media based characters don&#039;t do as well, in terms of sales.  Why is this?  Is the fun of the game lost in the attempt to make a videogame an accurate representation of the particular book or film?  Do the constraints of the characters&#039; book world or film world limit what the videogame player can do? Maybe I was asking an audience that just happens to not like such &quot;transmedia&quot; works, and I&#039;m making too rash of a generalization?  Still though, it seems that the most successful--and I&#039;m defining success by sales and sheer number of players worldwide--games have not been the &quot;transmedia stories&quot; but instead stand-alone videogames.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Narrative Architecture, Zork, Building Worlds</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/244</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;*Spoiler Alert: If you haven&#039;t played Zork yet, proceed with caution because some of what I say in this entry will potentially &quot;spoil&quot; the story for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, when I started to play Zork, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I started out in front of a white house, on the edge of a forest.  I thought this would be similar to the experience of interacting with Eliza, a simple exchange of user prompts and computer-generated responses. Boy, was I wrong.  As I found out after several hours of stumbling around in Zork-world, the white house and forest actually sit on top of an elaborate underground empire called The Great Underground Empire, complete with secret rooms and monsters to kill!&lt;/p&gt;
