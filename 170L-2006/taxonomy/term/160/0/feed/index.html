 <title>Identity Configuration</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/259</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While this may seem to be something of a regression, I find myself still thinking about certain  aspects of last week&#039;s reading.  In particular I am interested in the idea that Stuart Moulthrop raises that games &quot;appeal because they are configurative, offering the chance to manipulate complex systems within continuous loops of intervention...&quot;  Moulthrop&#039;s exploration of this topic seems to fall under a more &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; perspective in that he is concerned with the manipulations of the game&#039;s rules and the objects in the gameworld (as I understand it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a game I played years ago, back when I was more into games than I am today.  It was a role-playing game called Fallout, where you created a character and wandered about in a post-apocalyptic wasteland hanging out with mutants, killing things and tipping radioactive two-headed cows (actually this was a configuration that I never pulled off, though I wanted to).  This was before MMORPGs were really big, so creators of these games had to find ways to make the gameworld reactive, which more or less happens as a matter of course in the case of the online games.&lt;/p&gt;
