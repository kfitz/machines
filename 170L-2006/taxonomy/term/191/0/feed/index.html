 <title>Personal Bloggers: Can you forget your audience?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/542</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I think I mentioned in an earlier post, I&#039;m in a Women&#039;s Magazines and Female Journalists class at CMC.  Today KF joined our class and gave a really good, informative talk on blogs as a literary form and the creation of character through personal blogs (to name a few of her main points).  At the end, in response to a student&#039;s question, KF said (and I hope, KF, that you don&#039;t mind if I share this) that she guesses that 25% of her personal blog is written for herself, with no thought of her audience.  Of course, that means that about 75% of the time, she writes with her audience in mind.  Perhaps this number seems high to some, but I think it&#039;s surprising low.  After all, at the end of class, we talked about how personal blogs can be compared to reality TV shows: at times, somewhat scripted and perhaps representative of a false identity (though the viewer may never know if the identity is real or not).  Using that same comparison, I thought that a blogger must ALWAYS be aware that she is writing for an audience.  I mean, the people on MTV&#039;s Real World are certainly aware that a camera is in front of them and act accordingly, right?  Similarly, I thought that personal bloggers must always be aware of a potential audience.  But then I realized how my blog writing has changed over the semester; at first, I was incredibly uncomfortable writing something that would be posted to my professor, my entire class, and to anyone else who happened to stumble upon our site.  However, now I&#039;m much more at ease writing, and I don&#039;t feel as embarrassed raising points on the blog, even if they are somewhat personal.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stalking Rettberg and Privacy</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/320</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&#039;m becoming an internet stalker.  When I was looking up information on &quot;Kind of Blue&#039;s&quot; author, Scott Rettberg, I saw that he received his PhD from the University of Cincinnati.  I&#039;m from Cincinnati, and although I don&#039;t love my city, I get oddly excited when I hear others mention it, so I decided to pursue him.  I found a link to his &lt;a href=&quot;http://retts.net/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, and from there the stalking began.  There was a link below to a site called &quot;Jill&quot; and, lo and behold, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://jilltxt.net/&quot;&gt;Jill Walker&#039;s&lt;/a&gt;.  From looking at the sites, and his intrigued me in particular, you can read how they teach at the same university and about their adventures traveling to, say, a Turkish bath.  Or you can scroll through his photos, posted on Flickr.  That&#039;s right, you can see pictures of his dog, his vacations, his family on Christmas.  Or you can look through an album of 10 photos of Jill, which has the heading &quot;This set is mostly for me. Sometimes I want to see my girl.&quot;  That didn&#039;t stop me from looking.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Voyeurism</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/316</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&#039;s a bit unusual to write a blog with the purpose of asking a question about a definition, but I&#039;m going to do it: What exactly is voyeurism?  What&#039;s crucial to understanding it?  I was confused in class when we talked about it, but I was too embarrassed to ask.  However, looking at even recent posts on the blog that use the term make me realize that I am still confused, and I&#039;m not sure if my definition differs from others&#039;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia says &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism&quot;&gt;voyeurism&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;a practice in which an individual derives sexual pleasure from observing other people.&quot;  Other definitions I&#039;ve found seem a bit unclear on how sex is involved; is it necessary in voyeurism for the viewer to derive sexual pleasure, or can he/she just watch a sexual act?&lt;/p&gt;
