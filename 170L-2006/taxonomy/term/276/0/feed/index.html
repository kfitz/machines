 <title>Creating Identity on Social Sites</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/434</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m reading a collection of essays right now called &quot;Communities in Cyberspace&quot; and in it is an essay by Judith Donath called &quot;Identity and Deception in the Virtual Community.&quot;  In it she addresses one of the issues we discussed in class.  We wondered why people would choose to contribute to a wiki and we came up with a few possibilities.  Donath suggests that some people say altruism accounts for some contributions but she believes it is more likely that people want to assert themselves as knowledgable sources.  She says that &quot;building reputation and establishing one&#039;s online identity provides a great deal of motivation&quot; because no matter how intelligent your post is, you can only get recognition if the author is known.&lt;/p&gt;
