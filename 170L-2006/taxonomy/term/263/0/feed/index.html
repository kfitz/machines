 <title>Tomorrow&#039;s Artists; the power of new distribution channels</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/478</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to an Econ major friend of mine about the future of internet art from a business perspective and she pointed me to an article from the NY Times by Hal Varian, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/people/hal/NYTimes/2006-10-19.html&quot;&gt;Why Old Media and Tom Cruise Should Worry About Cheaper Technology&lt;a /&gt;.  In the article Varian states that old media execs have missed the boat by focusing so much on piracy.  What the should really be worried about is the &quot;falling cost of producing and distributing digital content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salaries of megastars such as Cruise are forms of &quot;economic rent&quot; and their dollar amount is determined by &quot;scarcity.&quot;  There&#039;s only one Tom Cruise and consumer demand for him is high.  But, as Varian points out, more and more free time of consumers is spent watching free content on the net, &quot;there are only 24 hours in a day.  The more time young people spend watching Lonelygirl15, the less time they will have to watch Mr. Cruise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mixing Worlds: Social Software and Books</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/423</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can talk to a Honnold/Mudd librarian online?  It was a funny concept to me, yet last Saturday I was eager to do it.  The most ironic part of me using this service from the library is that the reason I was using &quot;librarianchat&quot; was that I could avoid having to read online versions of articles and books.  That&#039;s right: I had found some sources for my final research paper for a class, but I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown because the only versions I could find were online.  So I turned to talking to the librarian over AIM.  (Another funny addition to the story is that I&#039;m usually on AIM all the time, but this semester I have been on it less and less, because it is such a huge distraction and I have been bombarded with work.)  Anyway, I signed online, talked to the librarian (who used all capital letters, which suddenly made me feel like I was a preteen and should be using them too), and figured out how I could get print editions.&lt;/p&gt;
