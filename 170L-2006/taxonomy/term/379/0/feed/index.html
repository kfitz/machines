 <title>One More Link (and this one&#039;s for a good cause--)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/687</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Through the miracle of Facebook fliers (yes, I clicked on one -- it looked pertinent and interesting! I promise I&#039;m not a sucker), I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://onewritething.com/&quot;&gt;one write thing&lt;/a&gt;. Although I could have gobs to say about the web design of the site (indeed, it&#039;s the first thing that jumped down my throat), I&#039;d like to talk about the idea behind the site. What is the idea behind the site? Well my dear reader, I&#039;m glad you asked (what was that you were saying about coercive writing?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind One Write Thing seems to be that if the writer can get people interested in the site, whether it be through his journalistic abilities or the prizes he plans to give away, he can get people to donate to a cause they care about. It&#039;s an interesting theory, and I want to consider it with respect to attention theory.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What if it doesn&#039;t end on the Last Page?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/686</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven&#039;t read Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke, you&#039;ve missed a mid-brow piece of addictive literature about two English magicians during the industrial revolution in Britain. With lots of references to Arthurian canon and a bit of artistic license with history, Clarke has created an immersive world. The world does not end with the last page of the book, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarke continues to continue the lives of her characters &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonathanstrange.com/copy.asp?s=2&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. In an interesting piece of metafiction, she describes her characters&#039; responses to the publication of the book the details their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
