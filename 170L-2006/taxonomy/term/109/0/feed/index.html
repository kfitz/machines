 <title>Daunted by Design</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/208</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I, like magoo, was very interested in the discussion on Monday relating to our frustration with the &quot;bad web design&quot; of Lexia Perplexia and Disappearing Rain.  Not being a web-designer myself, I was struck by a  vague feeling of dissatisfaction reading the two of them.  Upon reflection, I realized it was because of how aesthetically displeasing they were.  I&#039;m used to web-sites that look good, with nice color schemes, cool fonts, pictures, layout, etc.  I like my websites like I like my magazines: slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly part of the problem is that Lexia and Rain are old, and Larsen and Memmott were working with the techonology they had at the time, but I think it raises an interesting question: In regard to hypertexts, is being a good writer not enough? Do you need to be a good programmer/web-designer, too?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Unintended Materiality</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/205</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was interested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/200&quot;&gt;silversprung&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; question about whether materiality is that much of a big deal for authors not aware of their own materiality. Clearly, there are authors like Mark Danielewski who take great pride in proclaiming and commenting on their materiality, but it does seem that this is a given for the vast majority of authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &quot;Lexia to Perplexia,&quot; I (here I was about to say enjoyed, but that isn&#039;t quite the right coloration) was provoked by the issue of the &quot;face&quot; that we impose onto a computer monitor. Among other things, it brought to mind the biases that we bring to reading a text, in this case a mapping from our human experience of face-to-face conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Memmott &amp; the W3</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/193</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the comments, today and on the blog. They were all very helpful and very interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m wondering particularly about the relation between hypertext authors and their &quot;bad website design.&quot; To what extent and in what ways do you-all see the design principles that have evolved for commercial sites as relevant to the design of literature for the Web and for e-reading in general?&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I read Hayles&#039;s description and explanation of &quot;Lexia to Perplexia&quot; before I actually looked at Memmot&#039;s work, I was surprised how much it overwhelmed me and gave me a headache.  I couldn&#039;t click a back button, so I was often trapped in loops.  Once I clicked on Memmot&#039;s name, for instance, and kept seeing Egyptian symbols and circles.  I clicked around but couldn&#039;t find an exit, so I became frustrated and quit.  Then I reentered the site, began reading the &quot;Minifestos&quot; (which I actually liked because of the scroll-over definitions of words), but then accidentally clicked on a link that forced me to exit the site.  I should have believed Hayles when she said &quot;Lexia&quot; is &quot;a very &#039;nervous&#039; document&quot; (57).  I felt almost completely out of control, and the bright, flashing lines and messages (which I initially thought were cool) frustrated me when I couldn&#039;t read the text or make sense of what I read.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Orality and Literacy in &quot;Lexia to Perplexia&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/158</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been reading N. Katherine Hayles&#039; &quot;Writing Machines&quot; for the past two days, and she has a lot of really thought-provoking insights about various kinds of electronic literature.  (She also has many jargony sentences that make my head spin, but that&#039;s a different story.)  Her analysis of Talan Memmott&#039;s &quot;Lexia to Perplexia&quot; enabled me to think about that work with a kind of intellectual depth that I never would have been able to access without her guidance.  But I guess that&#039;s why we read criticism and theory, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found Hayles&#039; discussion of how Memmott creates a &quot;creole&quot; of English and programming code particularly fascinating.  She says that this creole &quot;forms the medium trought which the origin of subjectivity can be re-described as coextensive with technology.  Just as these hybrid articulations do not exist apart from their penetration by code, so the subject does not exist apart from the technology that produces the creole describing/creating the techno-subject (53).&lt;/p&gt;
