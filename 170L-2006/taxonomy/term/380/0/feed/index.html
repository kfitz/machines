 <title>Farewell and Goodnight</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/692</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&#039;m hopping on the bandwagon of farewell posts and summations.  While I didn&#039;t always appreciate the requirement to post x number of times on the blog, I must admit that it added a great deal to the class.  In a conventional classroom setting, you may occasionally see people reach beyond the scope of the assigned material, but it&#039;s generally in a generalized way, like &quot;Well, this really reminds me of another book I&#039;ve read, which I will now briefly summarize for you.&quot;  Unless you happen to be familiar with the reference, you are left to just nod and trust the speaker to inerpret the text for you.  With a blog and, more importantly, the ability to link, we are free to actually look at the source and make our own interpretation, thereby getting both the cross-pollination as one professor put it once, and an expansion of the class&#039;s discourse that goes beyond a dead-end reference.&lt;/p&gt;
