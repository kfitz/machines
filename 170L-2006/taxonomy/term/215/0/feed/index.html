 <title>Is Implementation a novel?  And what is Skin?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/357</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious and confused how to define Implementation.  Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/350&quot;&gt;Lulu&lt;/a&gt;, I don&#039;t necessarily think we need to pinpoint what Implementation is or isn&#039;t in order to read it, but its authors and Walker seem to beg readers to ask this question of it.  For instance, in the intro to Implementation, Rettberg and Montfort define the readers, depending on how they read or use Implementation, as either &quot;sheet readers&quot;, &quot;place readers&quot;, &quot;web readers&quot;, or &quot;participants&quot;.  For some reason I was annoyed when I read that only the people who post the stickers, photograph them, and send the photographs back to the authors are &quot;participants.&quot;  This identification/definition makes sense, but initially I was mad that I couldn&#039;t be considered a participant just from reading the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Reading Implementation and Skin</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/356</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I realized exactly what I&#039;d be reading, I printed out the &quot;letters&quot;/pages from Implementation as if I&#039;d be reading an article or a novel (which, actually, the authors claim it is).  Boy was I mistaken.  Some of the story lines were easy to follow, but often the dialogue completely switched topics from one paragraph to the next.  I had thought it was a bit ambitious for the authors to say  Implementation is a &quot;novel about psychological warfare, American imperialism, sex, terror, identity, and the idea of place, a project.&quot;  After all, that&#039;s a lot of topics for a short novel.  But once I started reading, I saw that these sudden changes of topic and interweaving of stories allowed for so much ground to be covered.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>How much authority did the authors have over their work?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/347</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Web readers will have an experience closest to that of a typical hypertext reader, but even then, the presence and order of material on the site will be determined by participants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am confused by this.  From what I could gather, the authors sent out 8 packets with three sheets each to participants.  The sheets we&#039;re presented with on the webpage.  Is this implying that the participants were given sheets with random bits on them, and they put them together in what they thought was the most cohesive order, and then got back to the authors on this?  Doesn&#039;t make sense, though, since the authors say the participants will *definitely* understand the full story arc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that the participants are more...not street artist, but...made the visual and social art aspects of the story happen, and could potentially make the political statements contained in the text far stronger, but had very little bearing on the full narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
