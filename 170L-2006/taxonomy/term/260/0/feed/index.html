 <title>Darkness on the Edge of (Online) Town</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/421</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m doing my project on internet forums, so I naturally read the wikipedia page about them that was linked from the social software article that we were assigned.  The main example that I&#039;ll be drawing from is &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.somethingawful.com/&quot;&gt;the forums at somethingawful.com&lt;/a&gt;.  As I browsed through wikipedia, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Freund&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about a former poster on that forum who killed two people and then himself over what most of us would deem a trivial slight.  Apparently, he had posted on somethingawful and other forums about the incident and his plans for revenge, even asking for and receiving information about where to buy ammunition on the forums.&lt;/p&gt;
