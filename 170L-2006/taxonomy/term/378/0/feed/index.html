 <title>Closing thoughts, of sorts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/693</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m finding it hard to come up with a way to round things out this semester, to come to any kind of closure with this class.  I&#039;m not sure if I managed to convey this, but I&#039;m enormously proud of all of you, of what you accomplished this semester, and of the bravery with which you took it on.  I know this was uncharted territory for the majority of you, and I know you must all have had moments (perhaps still today!) of wondering what the heck you&#039;d gotten yourselves into.  And I know that there were a lot of times (perhaps still today!) when you&#039;d have liked more input from me, more of a reassuring sense that we had a clear destination, that I knew how to get there, and that you were all well on track.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>farewell</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/684</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I leave you all with &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=CD6VgRUE1y0&quot;&gt;the best, most disturbing, and simple music video&lt;/a&gt; of the year.  Made by an artist not so much older than ourselves.  And the words of Hunter S Thompson: &quot;Sometimes the energies of a generation come together in a long fine flash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
