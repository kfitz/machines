 <title>what about the spam?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/611</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I just cleaned out the bulk box in my yahoo account, partially to procrastinate, partially to see if anything had accidently gotten directed there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when we first got the internet at my parent&#039;s place, my father was always freaking out, telling us that we were under no circumstances to open an email when we didn&#039;t know the sender, or the message was bulk-forwarded.  At times I had to call friends to make sure they had in fact sent me the chain letter that would promise  upon opening dismemberment, nightmares, eternal happiness, true love, and an endearing if medically unsound puppy if i did/not foward the message to the requisit number of people in 17.5 nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Did anyone else feel like they were subscribing to spam?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/344</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, I check my inbox, and there&#039;s an email with the title &quot;FW: your bum!&quot; and i had a really bad knee-jerk reaction.  Part of this may have been I&#039;d just been to my lj friends page, where rampant discussion was going on about females and objectification and sexism prompted in part by an op-ed piece in the NYTimes, thus much fur was flying and people being rubbed the wrong way as a very diverse group of men and women weighed in and got into a very ugly, highly charged mess on objectification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, kneejerk reaction i did have to Jemma&#039;s latest email.  It took me a moment to register that it was from planet Jemma, not just some bit of (rather British) spam for hott sexxx with girlnextdoorsbum. com opps delete the space before com :)  (or, i suppose, since it was *my* bum in question, friendlyanalsexxxwithproperbrits. com)  which, with its &quot;hello!&quot; &amp;amp; &quot;Re: your question&quot; and &quot;Wrgkwekg&quot; subject lines, really doesn&#039;t bother me.  What got to me about Jemma, about the whole way emails from her website and the &quot;people&quot; affiliated with it were-- i had to go through and read all the emails that i thought were spam, because it *might* be something for class from someone I&#039;ve never heard of, about some subject I don&#039;t know about because I didn&#039;t know Jamie was &quot;Desperately seeking attractive intelligent women to appear in my TV pilot.&quot;  It felt a lot more intrusive and irritating than the emails from Caroline and her ilk, because those had the sender as the email address, so I could see &quot;Ah, it&#039;s related to that website I&#039;m working with for class.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
