 <title>Territoriality vs. Collaboration</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/432</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the discussion we had yesterday in class about authorship in a collaborative work, I wanted to delve a bit into the problem of authority on wikipedia.  In browsing through Many to Many, I was most interested in the &quot;debate&quot; between Clay Shirkey and Larry Sanger about whether primacy should be given to &quot;experts&quot; in the editing of various wikipedia pages.  Shirkey quotes a comment that the debate drew, the most interesting part of which (I thought) was &quot;Wikipedia has seen several recent incidents, including one this month, where notable scientists have joined the project and engaged in patterns of edits which demonstrated utter contempt for other editors of the encyclopedia (many of whom were also PhD-holding scientists, though lesser known), attempted to &quot;own&quot; pages, attempted to portray conjecture or unpublished research as fact, or have exaggerated the importance or quality of their own work. When challenged, said editors have engaged in (predictable) tirades accusing the encyclopedia of anti-intellectualism and anti-expert bias--charges we&#039;ve all heard before.&quot;  While I cannot speak to the validity of this statement, if it is true it highlights a relatively ugly debate lurking behind the apparently harmonious face of wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
