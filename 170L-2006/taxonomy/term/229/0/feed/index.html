 <title>Winchester&#039;s Nightmare</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/370</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got a chance to have a look at Winchester&#039;s Nightmare just now, and I have to say that I found it to be far more bearable than either Zork or afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Winchester&#039;s status as a hypertext goes, what I appreciated about it was that there is at least an attempt to provide a spatial context for the exploratory kind of reading that the text demands.  Winchester takes as its central conceit that we are exploring the mental space of Sarah Winchester (at least that&#039;s how I see it).  As such, the confused, associative way of moving from one scene, one lexia to the next at least makes a certain amount of sense.  For example, you start out on a beach with a seashell in front of you and the way that you actually start the story (probably after some time spent wandering Zork-like to no particular purpose) is to listen to the shell, which the text compares to a rifle shell, and then boom, there you are in an armory.  I&#039;ll admit, I didn&#039;t just randomly decide to listen to the shell.  The text will give you a hint or a prod every now and then if you get stuck for awhile, which I appreciated.  The beauty of Winchester&#039;s premise is that it actually works with the structure of hypertext, rather than being almost incidental to it.  Arguably, afternoon&#039;s premise of reconstructing an accident was in harmony with this as well, but Winchester casts you as Sarah Winchester, whereas there is no clear point of entry for the reader in afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
