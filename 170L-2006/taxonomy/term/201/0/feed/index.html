 <title>Simulations</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/325</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed that much of the discussion during our last class meeting about the closing line of Jill Walker&#039;s essay (&quot;You don&#039;t play a simulation, it plays you&quot;) dealt with the idea of a &quot;simulation&quot; in mostly narrative terms.  However, I feel like this idea speaks to other forms in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we may examine it in reference to games.  Much was made in our readings on ludology of the idea of games as a &quot;rules-based&quot; experience, being more about our capability to manipulate the game world than about conventional narratives.  I&#039;ve found that when I play a game of any kind, my way of thinking adapts itself to the rules and limits of a game space, and I may find myself enacting behaviors that I would not necessarily consider desirable or right in a real-world context.  For example, when I would play Civilization, which is pretty much my favorite game ever, I act at odds with my real-world beliefs because that is the best way to win the game.  The French are expanding too close to my borders?  Well, I&#039;ll just wipe them out then, and get that sweet, sweet land.  The citizens in one of my cities are pissed off? Well then let&#039;s see how they like a nice dose of martial law.  In real life, such actions would be repugnant to me, but the game, the simulation, has its own logic, which it imposes on you as a necessary step to success.&lt;/p&gt;
