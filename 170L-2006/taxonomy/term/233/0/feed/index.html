 <title>Blogs as hypertexts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/372</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One of Jill Walker&#039;s ideas that I sort of struggled with was her claim that blogs could collectively function as a sort of hypertext--collaborating to form an authored work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally think of the authorship question in blogs as stemming from the blogger/commentator relationship--the creation of a text that talks back (think Ong and Plato from the beginning of the year). Walker claims in &lt;cite&gt;Distributed Narrative&lt;/cite&gt;that &quot;the story of a weblogger is described is [sic] by the story being told by several different narrators on their independent sites.&quot;  She expands a bit more on this in the Feral article, discussing the blog-diarist Justin Hall, specifically her view that his blog could be read as a hypertext through many different lenses.  For instance she claims that &quot;I could choose to limit it by authorship, as Foucault suggests, in which case I would choose to look at everything Hall has written.  Or I could choose to limit by the main character in the narrative, Justin Hall, in which case I would look at his girlfriends&#039; blogs and other writings about him as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
