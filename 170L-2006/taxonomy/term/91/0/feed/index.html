 <description>&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Othemindedness&quot; and elsewhere, I have also been thinking about Google and other search engines that guide our experience on the internet.  At least for someone like me, I rely on search engines to find the &quot;best&quot; and &quot;most relevant&quot; information on the web.  Yet, as Joyce points out, this both helps us filter through information and &quot;insists upon a hierarchy of information&quot; (54).  When you enter a keyword on one of the major search engines, it ranks information for you.  To search all of the sites offered would take forever, so you trust in Google (or Yahoo, etc).  I think Joyce is right in saying that as such editing tools expand, we will need to create a more &quot;human&quot; community to be sure that the tools remain tools, and do not dictate to us what to read and what not to read.&lt;/p&gt;
