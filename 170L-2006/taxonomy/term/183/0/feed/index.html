 <title>Is Implementation a novel?  And what is Skin?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/357</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m curious and confused how to define Implementation.  Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/350&quot;&gt;Lulu&lt;/a&gt;, I don&#039;t necessarily think we need to pinpoint what Implementation is or isn&#039;t in order to read it, but its authors and Walker seem to beg readers to ask this question of it.  For instance, in the intro to Implementation, Rettberg and Montfort define the readers, depending on how they read or use Implementation, as either &quot;sheet readers&quot;, &quot;place readers&quot;, &quot;web readers&quot;, or &quot;participants&quot;.  For some reason I was annoyed when I read that only the people who post the stickers, photograph them, and send the photographs back to the authors are &quot;participants.&quot;  This identification/definition makes sense, but initially I was mad that I couldn&#039;t be considered a participant just from reading the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Schemas that talk</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/310</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing a thesis on Henry James.  At the beginning of this semester, I was talking with one of my thesis readers, and she recommended that, during this year, I try to be thinking about James with every paper I write.  She said this, and I felt myself do the thing -- wide eyes and two or three quick head nods -- that means interest and assent, all the while thinking, &quot;Is she nuts?  I wouldn&#039;t even know how to try, and anyway, thinking that much about James would be deadly.&quot;  The weird thing, as it turns out, is that I didn&#039;t have to try.  Looking back on what I&#039;ve written so far this semester, everything -- be it on a poem by Lewis Carroll, William Blake, a syllogistic proof, or this blog -- has been processing some Jamesian thematic or another.  Or maybe I&#039;ve just learned to see it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is partly to do with why I&#039;ve been thinking, lately, about Douglas and Hargadon&#039;s discussion of schema theory.  Not only do these schematics help me to think about the way my own mind is working, but they also apply to a whole lot of what we seem to be trying to process in this class and on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scattered Thoughts on Categories</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/301</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Back again on the well-blogged about problem of narrative versus game versus hybrid, I wonder if it&#039;s just too soon to force names on emerging media forms. I&#039;m reading a book called Factual Fictions by Lennard Davis on the origins of the English novel. He discusses (not surprisingly) the birth (or maybe form) of the novel in the 17th-18th century arena, focusing on the blurriness between fact and fiction in these works. That alone isn&#039;t too relevant to our class blog, but in it he writes about defining the novel and trying to locate its birth. Davis says, &quot;The first and preeminent notion in any methodology of beginnings is that of the threshold. That is, at what historical moment does narrative, for example, becomes what we can call novelistic?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
