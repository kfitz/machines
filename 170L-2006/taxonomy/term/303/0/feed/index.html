 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Onyx Project seems to have been one of the most blogged about readings of the entire semester, and for good reason I would say.  Unfortunately I may be hopping into the game a bit late, but what I find most interesting about it is the tension between its determinedly &quot;new&quot; form and the familiarity of its subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of the Onyx Project are practically dogmatic about disassociating their &quot;NAVworld&quot; from movies and games.   They write on the website, &quot;We love movies/games.  This is not a movie/game.&quot;  However much they want to deny it, I think that they have a considerable dose of the old &quot;anxiety of influence&quot; going on (there it is, the first and last Harold Bloom reference on this blog). Pimm already wrote a post about how entwined the project is with the conventions and establishment of movie-making.  It&#039;s unavoidable, as an aptly chosen Mcluhan quote in that post illustrates, that new forms will display a heavy debt to their immediate predecessors.  The very fact that the creators denounce comparisons to movies and games so strongly indicates to me that there are more similarities than they want to admit.  If NAVworlds were as radically different as they claim, wouldn&#039;t those differences be self-evident?  Given that they do acknowledge a debt to movies and moviemaking, their efforts to differentiate NAV seem like a playwright saying &quot;No, I&#039;m nothing like Shakespeare, nothing like Shakespeare at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
