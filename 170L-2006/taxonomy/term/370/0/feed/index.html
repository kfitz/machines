 <title>Closing thoughts, of sorts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/693</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m finding it hard to come up with a way to round things out this semester, to come to any kind of closure with this class.  I&#039;m not sure if I managed to convey this, but I&#039;m enormously proud of all of you, of what you accomplished this semester, and of the bravery with which you took it on.  I know this was uncharted territory for the majority of you, and I know you must all have had moments (perhaps still today!) of wondering what the heck you&#039;d gotten yourselves into.  And I know that there were a lot of times (perhaps still today!) when you&#039;d have liked more input from me, more of a reassuring sense that we had a clear destination, that I knew how to get there, and that you were all well on track.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll keep this short and sweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanks for the memories, the posts, the blogging, the wiki-ing! Thanks for making my almost-last English class at this college an experience that was so different (in a good way) from any others that I&#039;ve taken.  I will miss blogging here and I&#039;m glad that you all made this class and blog worthwhile for me. =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanks!&lt;/p&gt;
