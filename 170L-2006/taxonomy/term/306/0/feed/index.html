 <title>Personal Bloggers: Can you forget your audience?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/542</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I think I mentioned in an earlier post, I&#039;m in a Women&#039;s Magazines and Female Journalists class at CMC.  Today KF joined our class and gave a really good, informative talk on blogs as a literary form and the creation of character through personal blogs (to name a few of her main points).  At the end, in response to a student&#039;s question, KF said (and I hope, KF, that you don&#039;t mind if I share this) that she guesses that 25% of her personal blog is written for herself, with no thought of her audience.  Of course, that means that about 75% of the time, she writes with her audience in mind.  Perhaps this number seems high to some, but I think it&#039;s surprising low.  After all, at the end of class, we talked about how personal blogs can be compared to reality TV shows: at times, somewhat scripted and perhaps representative of a false identity (though the viewer may never know if the identity is real or not).  Using that same comparison, I thought that a blogger must ALWAYS be aware that she is writing for an audience.  I mean, the people on MTV&#039;s Real World are certainly aware that a camera is in front of them and act accordingly, right?  Similarly, I thought that personal bloggers must always be aware of a potential audience.  But then I realized how my blog writing has changed over the semester; at first, I was incredibly uncomfortable writing something that would be posted to my professor, my entire class, and to anyone else who happened to stumble upon our site.  However, now I&#039;m much more at ease writing, and I don&#039;t feel as embarrassed raising points on the blog, even if they are somewhat personal.&lt;/p&gt;
