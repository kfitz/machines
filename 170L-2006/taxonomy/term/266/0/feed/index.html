 <title>World Bloggers</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/425</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After KF said that Technorati had graphs on blogging demographics, I went to explore the site myself. I found this graph on blog posts by language. The graph is found on this &lt;a href=&quot;//www.technorati.com/weblog/ &quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;, you have to scroll down to look at &quot;Posts by Language 2006.&quot;  English was still in the top with 39%, followed by Japanese, and Chinese, and well I&#039;m sure everyone here understands how to read a pie graph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;//www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000433.html &quot;&gt;caveats&lt;/a&gt; section (where Technorati explains why this data isn&#039;t perfect), it seems that the language of blogs isn&#039;t all that stable and the numbers seem to jump around a lot. It looks like the number of English blogs is actually increasing (at least from January 2005 to May 2006), which I find strange. I would have thought it would be the opposite. Also the site acknowledges that there are still bugs in the counting program, and that Korean and French blogs are being undercounted.&lt;/p&gt;
