 <title>Another funky book</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/199</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of class today we discussed whether or not the form of Hayles&#039;s book somewhat refutes her own claims because it basically forces certain mediums--like the imitations of internet links--into her text.  It made me think of a book I read for my African American science fiction (or Afrofuturisms) class that I actually mentioned in my last post.  The book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhythmscience.com/&quot;&gt;Rhythm Science&lt;/a&gt; by musician, turntablist, producer and writer Paul D Miller, aka Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid, has the image of a record on the front and a hole through the center of the record and the enter book.  The hole actually serves as purpose, because it holds a CD that&#039;s included at the back of the book.  As you might be able to tell from the link, the book has an odd array of images, colors, lines, and words scattered throughout.  (Including a repeating image of the playboy bunny; Professor Thomas said she couldn&#039;t figure why he included that--) It wasn&#039;t a big surprise for me to learn that the book, like Writing Machines, was published by MIT Press.  It even has an online version (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/mediawork/#&quot;&gt;&quot;WebTake&quot;&lt;/a&gt;), and the link to it is right above the link to Writing Machines.&lt;/p&gt;
