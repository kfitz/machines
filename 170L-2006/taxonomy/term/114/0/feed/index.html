 <title>Elegies for a lost art</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/268</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m reading the most strangely beautiful book--I thought it was going to be a book about authorship, but it&#039;s turned out to be this beautiful musing on what it is to read and be reader... its a collection of this man&#039;s insights into his lifelong love affair with books--the author is someone called Sven Birkerts, and what&#039;s he&#039;s written is called &lt;cite&gt;The Gutenberg Elegies&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Link+-ed it because it had a chapter on hypertexts, but as soon as the librarian brought it out to me, I knew I&#039;d not gotten what I&#039;d expected.  It looked like a novel--a normal paperback--rather than anything remotely scholarly.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Perspectives on the future of the writing</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/173</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the future of literature while reading posts on hypertexts, I was reminded of a passage from Helen Dewitt&#039;s novel The Last Samurai.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It seemed to me...that the writers of the future would...approach the level of the other branches of the arts which are so much further developed.  Perhaps a writer would think of the monosyllables and lack of grammatical inflection in Chinese, and how this would sound next to lovely long Finnish words all double letters &amp;amp; long vowels in 14 cases or lovely Hungarian all prefixes suffixes&quot; (63-64)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her view words from languages are each like different colors of paint which could be mixed together and composed to create something more beautiful than anything written before.  Clearly, reading/writing such a text would take a great deal of learning and isn&#039;t realistic for any kind of mass audience, but it&#039;s still a beautiful idea.  I suppose I was reminded of it because of how these hypertext authors view literature as such a malleable thing, while I have always thought of it as novel, poetry, drama, etc--the written word, on paper, complete with some sort of narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
