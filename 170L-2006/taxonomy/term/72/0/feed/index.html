 <title>A few things to take a look at...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/91</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve stumbled across a few blogs ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goldenfiddle.com&quot;&gt;goldenfiddle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodtuna.com&quot;&gt;hollywoodtuna&lt;/a&gt;) that I don&#039;t know what to make of yet.  They include links to ridiculous things and commentary but a lot of the time they&#039;re just providing comments on how female celebrities look (from a guy&#039;s perspective).    A lot of the stuff is pretty sexist, and it&#039;s strange to think about how quickly photos and gossip are put up on blogs.  There&#039;s something strange about looking at pictures of what some female celebrity wore yesterday and reading about how the dress was see-through or how skanky she looked.  I guess these blogs are providing some kind of service that people desire, like an ability to tear down the popular girls (like Go Fug Yourself), but the sexual tone of these blogs makes them different.  Maybe I&#039;m wondering if I should be more offended by them?  I&#039;m not sure, just some random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
