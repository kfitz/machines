 <title>Editors in the World of Electronic Literature</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/418</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading over the Electronic Book Review and the Future of the Book I was particularly interested in how the internet and the process of electronic writing will change the position of editor.  It&#039;s my belief that it&#039;s only a matter of time before electronic literature gets commodified in some way, be it through an online publishing company of some sort or a community of writers/critics who filter and market content, or some other variation.  The possibilities for creation within the form are so great and the internet audience is so large.  There&#039;s big money to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it seems unrealistic to think this electronic editor will be similar to those that control the publishing world.  Sure the basic task of cleaning up grammar and punctuation will still be needed, but in electronic literature the form and interaction between the different types of media and the user are in many ways as important as the words that make up the literature.  Thus I see the electronic editor as having more in common with Hollywood talent scouts than with traditional publishers.  The mark of a good electronic editor will be their ability to find and develop talent. Comb the internet for the next artist or face that can be sold to the internet public.&lt;/p&gt;
