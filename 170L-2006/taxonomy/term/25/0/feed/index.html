 <title>Not all who wander are lost</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/24</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this rather common quote three years ago at a gas station off of Highway 101. A group of high school friends and I were driving out to go on a backpacking trip to celebrate the end of our senior year. We stopped at a gas station near the trailhead to fill up the vehicles, and as I got out to stretch I noticed this singular rusted-out VW Beetle parked (well, perhaps I assumed that the situation was less intentional and more permanent than &quot;parked&quot;) next to the garage. Blazoned on its bumper was the above saying, and it is one that has stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of &lt;em&gt;wandering&lt;/em&gt; was one that I had to overcome several times while on my most recent journey through the wide world of blogs. I&#039;ve spent some time on personal blogs, and I definitely appreciated &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/blog/3&quot;&gt;Gunslinger1818&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s comments on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/blog/7&quot;&gt;marmalade&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s on &lt;a href=&quot;http://postsecret.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Postsecret&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this took some of the wind out of my sails and I decided to search for some new blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
