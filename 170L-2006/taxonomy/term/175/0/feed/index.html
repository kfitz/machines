 <title>Game Time and Narrative</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/294</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been thinking some about Jesper Juul&#039;s ideas about game-time.  It&#039;s occurred to me that narrative may in fact create an incongruity in game-time, as the narrative suggests one kind of temporal flow, and gameplay suggests another.  I&#039;m sure that at least a couple of you have played one of the Final Fantasy games.  One thing that I&#039;ve found incongruous about that sort of game is that the plot creates &quot;urgent&quot; situations where you are told that the villain has been spotted in some town and you have to go stop him.  The implication in the story is that you have to go now.  However, you can often wander about doing random things to your heart&#039;s content, while the urgency created by the plot just sort of festers in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
