 <title>Generations, Voices, Fragmentation</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/581</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Tophat made a post a while back about the &quot;Voice of Our Generation,&quot; which had me thinking about the question of why no author seems to &quot;define our generation&quot; in the way that past writers such as Fitzgerald and Salinger had. I sat down to write a comment, but it got pretty long, so I decided to just write a blog entry instead. Then it got pushed to the back burner and I decided to revisit it. Naturally this has nothing to do with needing to get my post count up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have to say that I&#039;m not sure I buy the idea that any writer can really function as the voice of a generation.  Fitzgerald and Salinger only really spoke for white middle to upper class males as far as I can tell.  Maybe somebody disagrees.  If we accept this proposition, then it makes sense to say that Fitzgerald and Salinger only really spoke for a minority of a generation.  Under these terms, it might make just as much sense to call Ralph Ellison the &quot;voice&quot; of the same generation as Salinger, but then he wasn&#039;t speaking for everyone either.  Considering these examples, it seems rather unproductive to look for a singular Voice of a Generation, but rather we should consider a plurality of Voices.  The Time Magazine article Tophat mentioned mentioned a number of different authors as candidates if you will for the mantle of Voice of the Generation, but I really don&#039;t see why we should attempt to whittle the list down to one and attempt to place the burden of speaking for the present generation on their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
