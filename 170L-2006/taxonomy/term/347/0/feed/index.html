 <title>rant about online applications</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/625</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m currently in the process of working on law school applications, as well as helping my friends who are working on their own grad school applications.  More and more schools are requesting that applicants submit their materials online, so that is the route I&#039;ve elected to go.  I have a very love/hate relationship with these online applications.  On the one hand, the ability to copy-paste or automatically fill in some of the basic information that every application asks for has made my life much, much easier.  I like being able to save my applications online, not having any papers to keep track of.  On the other hand, some of these text boxes do not have anywhere near enough room.  You run into the same problem on paper applications, but at least then you know ahead of time how much room you have, and can fudge things a little bit with small writing if you have to.  There is at least one applicaiton that I may have to submit in paper because the boxes they provide don&#039;t even have enough room to list the name of the company I&#039;ve worked at for the last two years.  I&#039;m glad the option is being offered, but some of these electronic application are a bit more of a pain in the neck than I anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
