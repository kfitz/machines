 <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright. So, I am sheepishly outing myself, tail between legs. I read &quot;afternoon&quot; after class. While I&#039;m not trying to defend myself, it was interesting going into the story already having a preconceived notion of what it was about-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a very different story, it feels like, the crash and the possible dead wife and son only popped up...once? Maybe twice? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like it. The indecisiveness, the lack of linerality, the inability to decipher whether there was one or multiple narrators, never quite exactly sure how any one character fit in with another, the fascinating interpersonal relationships that developed as a result. I very much saw myself reading my life, my blueprint of interactions with people, onto the story. The lack of coherency, I think, allows the reader to really pick and choose what fits where, how it fits, if it fits, what to disregard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/129&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
