 <title>I read a story for the story</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/190</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A previous post by Natwwal touched on some of the thoughts I&#039;ve been having about electronic literature and about the works we have read.  I too enjoyed the reader-friendly interaction with &quot;Disappearing Rain&quot; despite being disappointed with the jumbled and sometimes bad writing, especially in the &quot;River Journeys&quot; half.  The main distinction that I think has been bugging a bunch of us is the focus of several of the other hypertexts on the media and the form rather than content.  &quot;Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Lexia to Perplexia&quot; and even the description of &quot;Humument&quot; in Hayles piece lead me to think that the authors are far more concerned with the effect of the interaction the reader has with the interface and the medium than with the actual story (if there is one).&lt;/p&gt;
