 <title>Final projects - how long are we keeping these up?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/626</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So....uh....how long do you guys plan on keeping your final projects active and online?  I know this sounds like a silly question - why not just leave it up, for everyone to see and love and admire for all posterity or as long as the internet exists?&lt;br /&gt;
But mine kind of....worries me.&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, I know it&#039;s not Googleable.  I tried Googling various phrases and names from the family tree - no results.  But something about having THAT MUCH information online, accessible if you know how, and possibly accessible with later editions of Google or other search engines, freaks me out a little.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the stuff I said about people isn&#039;t bad, really, I swear.  It&#039;s just that I&#039;ve talked about EVERYONE in my family online, and that&#039;s a little scary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>101 vexations</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/566</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anybody else feel like they&#039;ve bitten off way more than they can chew regarding their term project?  Because by the looks of things on Monday, half of you seem mostly DONE, which is amazing to me.  I have my 101 lexia staring at me, and while I know every story that&#039;s going in the remaining ones, it&#039;s just....daunting.&lt;br /&gt;
And then there are the lexia I don&#039;t know what to do with, because I have too many stories for that person.&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s just hard with some of the people, like I&#039;ll never get across exactly what I want to for them unless the reader knows them themselves.  With a fictional hypertext, everything (or mostly everything) about it is on paper, or screen (whatever).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>No names?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/518</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s killing me to totally take the names out of my hypertexts.  I mean, my thing is a family tree, so I obviously have to have names.  But changing them...feels weird, somehow.  My best compromise that I&#039;ve been able to come up with is to just omit the last names, as for the most part, the names I&#039;m dealing with are pretty generic.  And actually, most of the people in it I&#039;d be happy to have read it.  It&#039;s just Aunt Beth.  Maybe I should just not write the story I was going to for her.  I don&#039;t know.  I have too much work.  I&#039;m overwhelmed, frankly.  Names are the least of my problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>There is NO online privacy. Change the Names!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/424</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to a fellow student&#039;s blog question, I thought I&#039;d broadcast this ASAP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not upload anything you don&#039;t want someone anywhere to read!! Not at all, not anywhere!! Not here, not now not because it&#039;s a class, never!! Actually, don&#039;t print it if you don&#039;t want it read, either, even under an assumed name. Exactly the wrong person will order it from Amazon 20 years later, for some other reason, looking for something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the person&#039;s name. Change the hair color, distinguishing characteristics, state of origin, name of local city and streets. If the people are recognizable, make them at least deniable: &quot;No, I didn&#039;t write it.&quot; Or &quot;No, it wasn&#039;t about you. The story&#039;s set in Squalidelphia.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
