 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in class we talked about the future of the book.  In particular, I was surprised that Bolter was so free in uploading &quot;Writing Space&quot; on the internet and allowing anyone to edit is as they please.  They say once you write a book and publish it for the world, it&#039;s not really yours anymore.  I guess Bolter is just really taking it to the next level.  At any rate, I was wondering, outside of the community of scholars particularly interested in this subject, who else legitimate would put a book online for free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my answer on a site called www.edge.org on which Jaron Lanier writes an article called &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.  Yochai Benkler, who is a law professor at Yale, has published a book called &quot;The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom.&quot;  He then posted it as a free download online and people (Lanier says between 15,000 and 20,000) downloaded it and added comments and links.  I checked it out and, sure enough, within seconds I had all 527 pages on computer.  Benkler said it&#039;s an experiment and presentation of what he sees as the future of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
