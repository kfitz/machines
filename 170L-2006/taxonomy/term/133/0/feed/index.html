 <title>Arianna Huffington as &quot;the human blog&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/218</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this article &lt;a href=&quot;http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/21989/index.html&quot;&gt;&quot;The Human Blog&quot;&lt;/a&gt; about Arianna Huffington.  It&#039;s a lot of promotional stuff and blah blah but it did make me think about the nature of the blog and the nature of the person who is participating in most of the technologies (and the communities that arise because of them) that we have today.  The article states, &quot;Everywhere she goes turns into a series of links, links that lead to other links. She&#039;s a human blog.&quot;  At first this just seems like one of those tagline throwaway sentences, but then I started wondering how it might have some relevance. Further down in the article the author claims,  &quot;her ability to shift swiftly from topic to topic, her swashbuckling political rhetoric, her penchant for attention-getting--are what the online world is all about.&quot;  It links the online world to the idea of popularity and &quot;contagious ideas.&quot;  All this interconnectedness and sharing of information, and sharing information quickly and being blatantly honest and persuasive, well, it&#039;s working for her, right? Influential people use her blog as a place to put out their opinions, and she gets to orchestrate the whole thing.  The article seems to be suggesting that a certain kind of person will excel in the online world...does this mean that some people are better suited for the world of print?  I guess where I might go with that is, well, if Huffington is more successful in the world of blogs, and there are obviously other people who find the most success in the online world, how is their influence different from the influence of those who have success in print? Does someone like Huffington gain influence because her work is constantly on the computer screen and constantly changing, because her work can shift continuously?&lt;/p&gt;
