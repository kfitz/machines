 <title>Teched-out Toys</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/99</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/ELMO_UNVEILED?SITE=TXCOR&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&quot;&gt;There is a 10th anniversary version of Tickle-Me-Elmo.&lt;/A&gt;  When did that happen?  It does bing up, though, the whole concept of the toy with a computer chip.  Toys that interact with kids, toys that are meant to learn.  Alright, so maybe Elmo&#039;s not a great example, but between the article and the furbies quietly pretending to sleep on my windowsill as they plot to take over the world, it&#039;s all at the forefront of my mind at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s interesting to me, that while there is a certain level of fear of technology getting smarter than us, taking over humanity, a notable portion of children&#039;s toys on the market today are this sort of technology.  I remember when furbies frst came out, and were declared potential threats to national security, since they could learn and repeat state secrets (I somehow doubt this, as mine mostly sneeze and declare &quot;FOOOOOM!&quot; though there is the occasional astute observation of &quot;Bo-ring!&quot;  The friend who gave them to me last year, though, warned me that the first generation of furbies had twice the learning capacity they were designed to have.  That&#039;s quite creepy right there.)&lt;/p&gt;
