 <title>Shorter American Memory</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/657</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shorter American Memory&quot; is a collection of prose poems by Rosmarie Waldrop, one of the poets who visited this semester as part of the English Department&#039;s Literary Series. I read &quot;Shorter American Memory&quot; for another class this semester and found it to be an incredible reading experience, and so considered adding the piece to our suggested reading list based on a tenuous similarity to the writing process Katherine Hayles describes in her chapter on &quot;The Humument&quot; -- Rosmarie Waldrop crafted &quot;Shorter American Memory&quot; by undertaking what she calls an abridgement, or collage poetry. That is, working with the text of &quot;American Memory,&quot; a high school textbook on U.S. history, Ms. Waldrop went through the existing order of the text and its chapters -- selecting words, phrases, and fragments either according to certain rules or according to her whims -- to create her own version of American Memory.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Stop making sense?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/564</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, my final project seems to want to look like an exercise in form and structure built on a solid theoretical foundation. I&#039;ve mentioned before on this blog that the theoretical and historical component is about memory in general, and a mnemonic practice known as &quot;memory palaces&quot; in particular. Looking at the site I&#039;ve built, and the method of navigation, it seems pretty essential that I provide (as succinctly as possible) some explanation of what an memory palace is and what it means to this project. Below I&#039;m including the summary I wrote up, and any feedback (e.g., &quot;no, I still have no idea what you&#039;re talking about,&quot; or, &quot;okay, I think I have some idea of what this palace thing-y might look like and why it could work as a hypertext&quot;) would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
