 <title>Ong but mostly other thoughts--</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/35</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Ong&#039;s discussion about the progression of writing talks about the contribution of the Greeks who developed the first alphabet containing vowels. The importance of this was that &quot;the Greek alphabet was democratizing in the sense that it was easy for everyone to learn&quot; (89). Yeah, this isn&#039;t a particularly complex point in comparison to everything else we read, nor is it even that integral to the rest of the Ong piece. However, the word &quot;democratizing&quot; caught my eye and made me think about a paper I wrote for another class about the rise of political blogs that rabidly advocated for their particular political party.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Amateur Hour</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/14</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first search through the millions of blogs &quot;out there,&quot; I realize that the &quot;out there&quot; concept might be an interesting one in itself.  As we read in class, blogging is native to the web and so maybe it has some of the seemingly infinite qualities of the Internet.  When we log online, we are entering a space in which we can share content and enter into discussions which we would not enter into in real life.  Pop psychology suggests that people are more likely to open up to one another in darkness, where there is no eye contact.  Perhaps this is the high-tech equivalent?&lt;br /&gt;
        With this in mind, I started searching for sites that involved offbeat, interesting subjects.  I mainly searched through discussions of the paranormal (from crop circles to bigfoot-and some fairly vicious skeptic blogs).  One example is thedebrisfield.blogspot.com but there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;
