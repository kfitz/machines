 <title>The Legacy of &quot;Lexia to Perplexia&quot;</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/573</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated with &quot;Lexia to Perplexia&quot; when we read it in class a few weeks ago.  While the piece was very innovative, it had a very gimmicky feel that left a bad taste in my mouth.  Based on class discussion, I don&#039;t think I was alone in my opinion.  Thus, I am rather intrigued by how many of our final projects (my own included) make extensive use of images and sounds.  I believe it was Shock and Awe who complained that hypertexts frequently have &quot;too much text and not enough hyper.&quot;  While nobody came up with a project as odd or experimental as Memmott&#039;s, I began to see shades of Lexia in many of the presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Materiality and Journaling</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/561</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by the presentation today that compared blogs with classic, paper-and-pen journaling. The presenter mainly focused on the similarities between blogs and paper journals, raising some interesting parallels that I was unaware of.  I thought that the presenter did a great job of discussing the public/private dichotemy in paper and online journaling.  However, the project got me thinking about my own experience journaling.  At various points in my life, I have maintained a written journal, a blog, and a computer-based journal that I did not share or publish online.  It was my experience that I wrote about very different things in each format.&lt;/p&gt;
