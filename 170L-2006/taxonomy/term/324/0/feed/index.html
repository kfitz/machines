 <title>New words compliments of the Internet</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/571</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.m-w.com/&quot;&gt;Merriam Webster&lt;/a&gt; word-of-the-day service.  It&#039;s a free service that sends you a different word each day along with a definition, use-it-in-a-sentence, and a word history.  I originally signed up for the service in the hopes that it would help me on the GRE vocab section (I&#039;m not convinced it&#039;s done me much good on the test or in everyday life) but I never signed off of the service because it has some fun words sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#039;s word is cybrarian which apparently is &quot;a person whose job is to find, collect, and manage information that is available on the World Wide Web.&quot;  It sounds so corny to me but apparently the word has been in use since 1992.  In general, I think it&#039;s funny that the web has had so much influence on new words that almost always sound so corny.&lt;/p&gt;
