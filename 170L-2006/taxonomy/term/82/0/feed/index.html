 <title>More and More (Media)tion</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/646</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As if we needed even more technology to mediate the world for us, someone has come up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section1A.t-3.html&quot;&gt;the ambient walkman&lt;/a&gt;.  Basically, the product is a pair of headphones which sample ambient noise and turn it into some form of music.  Its creator prefers to style it &quot;The Ambient Addition,&quot; which frankly I find insufferable.  The idea that we need even more mediation seems ridiculous to me.  I suppose that the technology represents a somewhat cool achievement, but I&#039;m at a loss to understand why anyone would want to listen to an approximation of music created by the birds, the bees, and those jackhammers down the street (although I suppose that combination would be pretty wild).&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Aha! A video game review in mainstream media!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/276</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;How appropriate! Just when we were all lamenting over the lack of videogame reviews in the media, I open up my browser and lo and behold! a videogame review appears on the frontpage of my city&#039;s online newspaper site!  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com&quot;&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; occasionally reviews videogames using the same rating system that they use for films.  The clapping man jumping out of his theater seat is a sign that the video game is super awesome.  Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/24/DDGSCLTG6F1.DTL&quot;&gt;this videogame review&lt;/a&gt; rates this new videogame called Bully. This is an &quot;immersive boarding school experience&quot; where you have to play &quot;Tough kid Jimmy&quot; whose &quot;weapons of choice were itching powder and wedgies.&quot; Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Daily Show</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/105</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve often wondered why it is that people of our generation seem to find Jon Stewart much funnier than people my parents age do.  It&#039;s not as though the concept of spoofing news is particularly new; SNL has been doing it for years.  I&#039;m still trying to sort through the significance of this, but last night, as I was watching the Daily Show, I was struck by the similarities between the show&#039;s format and the format of a blog.  Instead of &quot;link, commentary,&quot; the Daily Show offers us &quot;video clip, commentary.&quot;  While SNL comics did something similar, they tended to stay in character.  Jon Stewart doesn&#039;t try very hard to maintain the persona of a newsperson.  His own voice and opinions come through very clearly.  In this way, he isn&#039;t so different from political bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
