 <title>The Competition Factor</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/236</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I had never really thought about video games seriously before the last couple weeks.  But the readings, class discussions, and blog posts caused me to look back on my own gaming experiences and compare them to my experiences with other arts.  One major facet of gameplaying, total different from my relation to other art froms, emerged: Competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best games I played lured me into a war.  Immersion for me was throwing the controller when I lost, punching walls, and then feeling angry and silly for hours.  I have thrown books, shut off CD players in a rage, crumpled up artwork, but it was always because they were bad and I could tell, not because I was bad and the art had beaten me.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ms Dewey and the invasion of the virtual personality</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/228</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A few posts ago I mentioned how I imagined the future blog to be a wise-looking old man.  Well apparently someone out there sees the future search engine as a sexy young multiracial woman in a lowcut but very classy black suit/dress.  Her name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msdewey.com/&quot;&gt;Ms. Dewey&lt;/a&gt;.  She talks on her cell-phone, reads a magazine, and pesters you to query her with more searches.  She grows bored and annoyed when neglected.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she is damn creepy.  Why?  Well first of all there are the disturbing racial and gender implications of her submissive+sassy attitude and attire.  But, and this is what I&#039;m interested in, it seems also to be an issue of invasion.  There&#039;s something disturbing about having such a vivid virtual personality present itself on your computer screen.  Even when the page is minimized or sub-tabbed you can feel her presence, watching you, waiting for instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
