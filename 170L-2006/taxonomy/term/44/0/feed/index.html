 <title>Techno &amp; Other Determinisms</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/49</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Questions of technological determinism remind me of similar dichotomies -- mind|body, nature|nurture, and so forth. The problem seems created by a misposing of the question. One asks whether a presumed factor in some change has all impact or no impact, or some impact; one measures the impact on change as though the factors were addeded incrementally. This misrepresents causal relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
   The seems like something in the family of the &quot;complex clause&quot; fallacy. A couple of metaphors might clarify what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;
   Consider factors like &quot;technology&quot; and &quot;human nature&quot; to speak very broadly, as multiplying against each other instead of aggregating. It becomes absurd to ask whether in the equation 3*2=6, the 3 or 2 is more important: There are two threes, three twos. Removing either nullifies the entire result. Similarly, ask oneself whether the length or breadth of a 2*3 table is more important. One might be tempted to say that the length is more important, since the # is greater, but how much length remains if one removes the width?&lt;/p&gt;
