    <div class="content"><p>So continuing with Lulu's idea that social software is all over the place, I just scrolled through if:book until I found something that really interested me, which of course ended up being a bit unrelated to the topic at hand. </p>
<p>But, anyways, I found a <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2004/12/the_film_as_book.html"> post</a> called, "the film as book," about the movie Tarnation, which is a super low-budget film about the filmmaker's relationship with his mother. The interesting thing about this film is that it is composed of actual videos, answering machine messages, and pictures from the director's life.  The blog post was mostly concerned with how film was merging with books and the way the movie seems to be composed of "writing."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, we read about social software and its various forms this week.  A few thoughts after reading/browsing through the websites--</p>
<p>1) Is it just me or does "social software" seem like a highly vague and generic term that pretty much describes almost everything that we do online?  The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_software">entry</a> defines social software as media that "enables people to rendezvous, connect or collaborate through computer-mediated communication and to form online communities."  Wikipedia's list of social software encompasses anything and everything technology/communications related, including several topics we've already covered in class like blogs and video game worlds.  My initial reaction was that it seemed almost daunting and impossible that we attempt to cover "social software" in just one week because such software seems to include enough material for an entire semester's worth of discussion.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So now that we've actually hit the social networks portion of the class, I'm going to go back to the facebook issue. I remember that we already discussed facebook a little at the beginning of the semester (in light of the news feed debacle), but I think that the many 2 many blog offers some meatier stuff to think about here. There was kind of a lengthy <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/09/17/facebooks_privacy_triumph_stealth_secrecy_and_melodrama.php ">debate</a>going on, and people had some intense reactions (which is sort of amusing because I get the feeling that these adults aren't even on facebook).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was pretty surprised to read this from "Distributed Narratives" concerning personal blogs-</p>
<p>"Although these sites are public, and their authors are well-aware that their words are read by many, my pinpointing connections and analyzing relationships by the words in which they are told seems to cross a boundary that should not be crossed"</p>
<p>Walker finds this sort of examination "ethically problematic." Does she mean it would be unethical to map out all the personal relationships and intricacies and then write about it? That may be unethical (maybe) but it also wouldn't be very interesting in an academic arena, so it's kind of a moot point. If Walker means it's unethical to do so out of curiosity, then I think I disagree. If you're invested in someone's blog, particularly the blog of someone you've never met, why wouldn't you want to read their friends' blogs? Why wouldn't you want to read about different perspectives on your blogger? Different stories?</p>

The map thing was fun, though.  Near my boyfriend lives a "rippling".  There's a "papery" in Perth, which would make me feel self conscious about my skin as I aged.  There's a "junk" in Texas, which could be hilarious if placed correctly on the body.  Nobody's doing it around here.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm curious and confused how to define Implementation.  Like <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/350">Lulu</a>, I don't necessarily think we need to pinpoint what Implementation is or isn't in order to read it, but its authors and Walker seem to beg readers to ask this question of it.  For instance, in the intro to Implementation, Rettberg and Montfort define the readers, depending on how they read or use Implementation, as either "sheet readers", "place readers", "web readers", or "participants".  For some reason I was annoyed when I read that only the people who post the stickers, photograph them, and send the photographs back to the authors are "participants."  This identification/definition makes sense, but initially I was mad that I couldn't be considered a participant just from reading the narrative.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I got a lot out of Walker's "Distributed Narratives." She brought up a lot of interesting stuff (though didn't seem to give herself enough space to discuss them all). I particularly liked the sticker art discussion. To me, it seems like the older, pre-Internet project Truisms by Jenny Holzer was more--hard-core. That's not a very good word for it, but in the age of the web, things like Implementation don't have much mystery to them, because the segments are all posted online. </p>
<p>Walker writes, "the implicit links of the distributed narrative are instead invitations that encourage the audience to go and find more" (10). With Implementation, the finding it pretty minimal, it's all right there. There was something more interesting and secret-club-esque about Holzer's pieces scattered all over Manhattan. Of course, the nature of these projects are different in that Holzer was a one-woman show while Implementation incorporated lots of different people who were given freedom to place the stickers where they wanted. But still. If you found a string of stickers out of nowhere, and didn't have the power to Google it, then I think you'd feel pretty cool.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was very intrigued by Shelley Jackson's <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html">Skin</a> project. The idea that "each participant will be known as a word, and as words die, the story will disintegrate" is fascinating, and I'm also a little disturbed at how destabilizing this can be for a text. (12)  </p>
<p>Walker calls this a form of distributed narrative, and it's a perfect example of her so-called "feral hypertext," an undomesticated and wild text.  My question is, if this narrative is written in such a way that it cannot be read, is it still a narrative?  It fits under Walker's definition of what a distributed narrative should be, but for the unsuspecting reader/viewer, would we approach this as a work of art and not even consider it a narrative?  For me, I saw the project's <em>concept</em> as the story which the author is telling, rather than seeing the actual content of "Skin" as the narrative.  Does this make sense?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I decided to investigate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennicam"> Jennicam</a>, the webcam girl who was mentioned briefly in class on Monday.  Wikipedia's information on her was interesting, but the information I stumbled upon that was linked that page was even more fascinating.  I clicked on another Wikipedia page entitled "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_whore"> Cam Whores</a>", which, according to Wikipedia, is "a term for people who expose themselves on the Internet with webcam software in exchange for goods, usually via enticing viewers to purchase items on their wishlists or add to their online accounts."  To learn more, I clicked on a link on that page to an article in The New York Times from December 2005 on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/national/19kids.ready.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=aea51b3919b2361a&ex=1292648400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"> Justin Berry</a>, a boy who at the age of 13 began using webcams in order to get more friends and ended up basically starting a pornography business.  For five years, he brought in tons of money from pedophiles.  There's a link on the left side to a 7-part interview series from the NY Times on him, and it is incredibly sad, moving, and fascinating.  His story, both about how he began his business and why he chose to end it by turning in himself and all his files to the FBI, made me think of our class for a few reasons, some more obvious than others.  First of all, I asked earlier about the word voyeurism, and this definitely seems like an example of it.  Secondly, when he talked about the pedophiles (who, creepily enough often ended up being people who work with children, such as teachers, pediatricians, and child lawyers), he mentions how he thought of them as "friends," though the friendship was completely constructed and often built on lies and an artificial web relationship.  Does this remind anyone else of Jemma?  Of course I'm not saying that Jemma played the role of either pedophile or pornographer, but it did ring a bell with me and made her forced friendship feel even more odd (and the promotion of her site to, say, teenagers as wrong).  Finally, Justin turned over the conversations he had with his "customers" that were logged on the computer, so, "Kind of Blue"-style, the FBI could (and is currently, I think) investigate them in a huge lawsuit.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We talked in class today about the format of "Kind of Blue" and whether it can be reproduced in print form or whether the story relies on its email/internet form for meaning.  From what I gathered, some people believed its email style could be transferred to an epistolary print novel, especially since the fake in-box doesn't quite make sense in that all of the emails--no matter the recipient--are in the same in-box.  Others seemed to like the online style, and I agree.  I tried to think of what ways that this story might rely on its medium and form, and one thing that came to mind is its promiscuity.</p>
