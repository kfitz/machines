    <div class="content"><p>I'm sorry, Talan Memmott, if you're out there reading this, but I really didn't want to read another piece about Lexia to Perplexia.  The screenshots in the book just served to remind me how little sense I made out of it, and furthermore, weren't even things I was able to get to.  I actually went back in a moment of perverse curiosity to try to find that little man shown in the third picture in the book, but it didn't turn out too well.  It just made me think of the hypertexts we read that had some sort of "solution" that was next to impossible to find.  The best way to deal with these things are to just click around and not expect to find anything in particular, I suppose.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>My reaction to Caroline and Jemma doesn't stand out from the rest of the class who has blogged on them: they weren't my favorite.  I'll admit, it was fun to hear British accents and relive some of the British abbreviations from my study abroad days, but the content of the both of the sites was less than interesting.  The intense sexual and/or alcohol themes of both simulations annoyed me and made me believe that these are designed for teenagers who want a peek at either uni life (however realistic it may be) or the life of a young working woman.  Emails from Jemma's coffee date reading "Fancy something stronger tonight?" and Caroline's drunkenness with Simon in her first video turned me off.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I first logged onto Online Caroline for about 30 seconds, looked around, thought she was a real person, and then logged out.  I thought she was just another blogger.  I was tired that night and decided to put off "playing" with her until the next day.  </p>
<p>The next day, I read Jill Walker's essay on Online Caroline.  It was during the reading that I realized Caroline was fake.  I "spoiled" the story for myself before I could even start my "friendship" with Caroline.  I walked into this "relationship" already skeptical because of Walker's analysis, and after about 10 minutes of being Caroline's "friend," I was convinced this was not for me.  I echo a lot of skepticism that others, including <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/293">crashingintowalls</a> and <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/283">tophat1</a>,talk about in their posts.  I mentioned in some comments in other people's posts that the over-friendly tone, though aimed at making the situation believable, actually has the opposite effect.  Caroline's attempts at moving this friendship forward had a negative effect on me.  The web designer's "tools" of friendship, including personalized emails and a conversational, direct tone makes the "player" realize that this situation is forged, fake. Like other people have mentioned, the personalized email does not feel personalized--rather, it seems contrived to me.  It seems to me like the web-designers are forcing the friendship onto the participant, wanting desperately for us to buy into their scheme.  But, as many of these posts seem to suggest, it hasn't been working for the most part.</p>

<p>The first installment--Skip's come-on email to Suzanne-- dear Lord, do you know what I mean by 'cringe' reading?  I think, personally, the best example (albeit I'm not thinking of the book here) is <cite>Bridget Jones' Diary</cite>.  Where you feel so<br />
embarrassed for the character that you have to close one eye and sort of hold the book a bit further away?  I wasn't sure if I could get through the rest of the emails at that rate--my eyes would be too squeezed shut, and the computer screen would be all the way over on the other side of the room.  He was so hokey... so clichÃ©d... so totally embarrassing himself... I felt so badly for him!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Transmedia. The future of media and gaming?  Or rather, is the future now? Henry Jenkins writes that "transmedia storytelling...depends less on each individual work being self-sufficient than on each work contributing to a larger narrative economy." (124)  He includes books, film, television, comics, and other media, "each doing what it does best, each a relatively autonomous experience, but the richest understanding of the story world comes to those who follow the narrative across the various channels." (124)  </p>
<p>I've asked some friends who like gaming whether they feel this is true, and they seem to think that the best games are those that don't belong to some "narrative economy."  Stand-alone games that don't seem to have a narrative arch like CS and Diablo are, as we all know, really popular and it doesn't matter that there's no background story.  Video games that involve Harry Potter and other non-computer-media based characters don't do as well, in terms of sales.  Why is this?  Is the fun of the game lost in the attempt to make a videogame an accurate representation of the particular book or film?  Do the constraints of the characters' book world or film world limit what the videogame player can do? Maybe I was asking an audience that just happens to not like such "transmedia" works, and I'm making too rash of a generalization?  Still though, it seems that the most successful--and I'm defining success by sales and sheer number of players worldwide--games have not been the "transmedia stories" but instead stand-alone videogames.</p>

<p>Basically, it's this: <em>Why</em> do we care what (if any) "difference" there is between narrative and games?</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe I'm being narrow-minded (or an English major), here, but it seems really obvious to me that there is a narrative element to video games--<em>duh</em>, of course there is. That's what happens when people do things in fictional universes: in some form or another, stories develop--whether they're plot-based, character-based, or world-based, there is some kind of narrative. Even in that James Bond game. Even in snowboarding games. It may not be a <em>traditional</em> narrative, but to try to divorce games from narrative seems pointless.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Playing with Zork was interesting, to say the least.  I could see the conflict Henry Jenkins describes in "Game Design as Narrative Architecture."  He writes, "Game designers struggle with this balancing act--trying to determine how much plot will create a compelling framework and how much freedom players can enjoy at a local level without totally derailing the larger narrative trajectory.  As inexperienced storytellers, they often fall back on rather mechanical exposition..." (126).  With Zork, I felt the larger narrative framework was derailed...or I couldn't find it.  Like Lulu, I googled (actually, I Wikipediaed) Zork, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  There is no way I could have figured out what I was doing and even get out the trees in the dimly lit forest until Wikipedia gave me simple commands to use.  Even after I found some help sites, I still couldn't figure out what to do.  The most frustrating part was that I felt like I was following strict guidelines that weren't even told to me on how to play the game.  I repeatedly typed in responses (which I thought made sense) that caused the message "I don't understand what you mean" to pop up.  After seeing those over and over, I wanted to scream at the computer.  Yet, oddly enough, the pleasure of typing something that caused a positive reaction or an actual response was rewarding enough to keep me going.  However, eventually the displeasure of seeing that my responses were invalid made me play the trick that KF said user did with Eliza: come up with ridiculous responses in order to mess up the system.  This turned out to be my favorite part, because I felt like I was getting a human answer.  For instance, I was stuck in the forest behind a grating, and I typed "pick up grating," to which Zork replied "You can't be serious."  When I found more grating and typed "jump grating" (again), I got "You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?"  Later, when I found the bird chirping in the tree, I (for kicks, I hope I'm not this violent in real life) typed "kill bird."  Zork responded: "I've known strange people, but attacking a bird?"  Funny stuff.  The amusing part is that enough users must have tried to input these same, weird commands or the creators of Zork suspected that there would be oddballs like me who wanted to push the game's buttons (so to speak) or they wouldn't have created those replies.  It made me want to continue just so I could see where I would get a funny reply and not simply "I don't understand what you mean."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I liked how in the First Person book there were opinions and responses aligned along the bottom of the pages to which they corresponded, but if they're trying so hard to make it like a hypertext in this way, why not just publish the book online?  I'm starting to feel this way about a lot of the books we've been reading.  They all talk about the hypertext as the medium of the future, blah blah blah, do so much to make their text seem as if we're experiencing it digitally - but they're all still on paper!  Isn't that sort of undermining their point? </p>
<p> Futhermore, these books are aimed at people who already are immersed in this digital culture, so wouldn't the best way to snag them to read the book be to put it in the forum they already inhabit?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I keep trying to make connections between Juul's idea of "flow" and Douglas &amp; Hargadon's idea of the "engaged reader," but I'm not sure if I'm doing a very good job.</p>
<p>Juul is the author who talks about "game time" and has the lovely graph that looks like a slinky.  According to him, flow is what occurs when: "--the challenges match the player's abilities and thereby lead to a state of <cite>flow</cite> (the player loses the sense of objective time -- time will fly)" (139).  The player is immersed.  But the point is hard to reach, Juul claims.  A very exact balance must be struck:<br />
"To reach a state of flow, a game must be neither too hard (which leads to anxiety) or too easy (which leads to boredom).  This means the experience of time is tied not only to the play time/event time relation and to the challenged provide by the game, but also to the relation between game difficulty and player ability" (139).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>What a cool little article from Gonzalo Frasca! After the Moulthrop piece in the last section, I can't say I'm shocked by the socially conscious way that some academics are approaching video games, but I'm still surprised. Claiming that videogames could deal with social issues in a productive way is a bold statement (and maybe a bit ridiculous?...) but pretty interesting. I was particularly provoked by Augusto Boal's work with the "Theater of the Oppressed." I'm pretty sure I wouldn't actually want to attend a performance where the point "is not to produce beautiful or enjoyable performances, but promote critical discussions among the participants" (89). Then again my miniscule attention span prevents me from attending theater in general. Also, don't good plays provoke critical discussion anyways? Perhaps theater-goers should be forced to stay after plays and break into small discussion groups. Or--perhaps not. Still, it sounds like this man's work is intense.</p>
