    <div class="content"><p>I suppose it is a testament to my underlying control-freak tendencies that as I read "Afternoon," I found myself wanting to explore all the options that were possible from whatever screen I was on-- I didn't want to miss anything.  I kept retracing my steps, going backwards in the story in order to go forwards in a different direction.  Except that there really is no backwards or forwards in "Afternoon," which laughs loudly in poor little linearity's face and then steals its lunch money.</p>
<p>Eventually, my reading experience became a quest for the new: I began to "surf" the story, looking for new branches I hadn't seen before.  Reading "Afternoon" felt kind of addictive in this way, because I didn't want to stop reading the story while I was still discovering new parts of it.  I guess this impulse to "finish" the text has a lot to do with the way printed class reading is assigned: one reads the whole selection, and then one has finished the assignment.  But with "Afternoon," the challenge is not finishing the reading, but actually unearthing the whole text and making sense of it.  In fact, Joyce deliberately denies closure to the reader--even the meta-screens that comment on the reader's unending, evolving experience consciously refuse to end the story.  It was engaging, but also somewhat frustrating.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>My experience with Afternoon was similar to Bird's and thisismycheese's, although maybe a bit more extreme. I wanted to take this Joyce fellow by the collar and shake him until a cohesive story that I could read front to back came out.  The bottom line of any literature, be it hypertext or a papyrus scroll, is: is the writing good?  Joyce is a good writer, which is what makes Afternoon impossible to dismiss.  </p>
<p>Reading contemporary fiction I often feel that the writers are so desperate to create something new and original that they allow their story to suffer by trying to fit it into a hip modern frame, rather than working to make the hip modern frame fit into their story--or work as a component that makes it better overall.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Two thoughts--</p>
<p>Do you all recall Ong, and his talk about the hoopla that went on against literacy (in favor orality)?  He cited Plato and Socrates as being anti-text, because texts were unquestionable, untestable--they represented the authors opinions in an environment where they could not be responded to or attacked.  </p>
<p>Now read this from the Landow introduction: "A full hypertext system, unlike a book and unlike some of the first approziations of heypertext currently available (Hypercard, Guide,), offers the same environment to both reader and writer.  Therefore by opening the text processing program, or editor, as it is known, you can take notes, or you can write against my interpretation, against my text.  Although you cannot change my text, you can write a response and then link it to my document" (6).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The discussion in Landow about hypertext and poststructuralism makes me question if deconstructing the linearity of traditional printed material necessitates rendering books obsolete.  Several people, including Gunslinger and Frabby, have already expressed uneasiness at the idea of hypertext replacing books.  I also have a fond attachment towards books.  I don't necessarily agree when critical theorists like Derrida make statements like "changes in media have eroded the power of the linear model and the book as related culturally dominant paradigms." (47)  Why is linearity necessarily a bad thing?  Does the discovery of a new, more free form of reading texts have to involve antagonizing the previous traditional forms?  I feel like many of these poststructuralists truly underestimate the power of human attachment, memory, and emotion--and the historical cultural power and force of the book.  Just look at some of the previous entries with people's testimonies, like gunslinger's image of reading a good book at the remote family cabin or frabby's comment about parents reading their children bed-time stories.  Many of the critical theorists in Landow's piece are suggesting that the new technological developments are overdetermining the end of the book age.  Derrida even declares that "the end of linear writing...is indeed the end of the book." (47) I feel like the effort to decenter the author and institute active reader participation has been flawed in that it privileges these new media developments without considering the powerful, emotional pull that traditional print material has on people. Book culture and the hypertext culture don't necessarily need to be antagonistic forces.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I share some of the feelings and concerns that gunslinger and marmalade have voiced. Not only am I very attached to the act of physically reading a book (I can't stand reading things online, I always print them out), but I like answers. And the types of fiction that Joyce discusses provide very few answers, as Marmalade points out. Yet before we can start jumping up and down angrily, he hits us with, "What we see as senseless beauty may be the emergence of as yet unrecognizable new ways of making sense" (63). So we just don't get it right now? I can buy that, I'm sure if I were born in a different era, I would be preaching orality with everyone else (though I'm still impatient for my own understanding of literacy to expand). But it still seems like a bit of a cop-out: it's too amazing, it transcends us, and we can't grasp it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>What is it if a story reads like that?  Is it a story?  Is it a "text" if there is no distinct timeline or story in set form?  How do you analyze it?  How do you ask yourself questions about it that are meaningful to the work as a whole--not just your specific experience of it?  How can you be a scholar of hypertexts--are English professors a dying breed? </p>
<p>I got lost at so many points--I'm not sure if I could even give you a coherent plot summary.  And I don't know if I'd used my "yes" and "no" buttons differently if the story would have been more coherent, either.  It seems like Joyce is arguing in the article we read that he intends his stories to be relatively incoherent--allowing the reader yet another way of "personalizing" the story for themselves.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've been chewing on the relationship between technology and individuality for awhile, partially as a result of a blog post that <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/86">magoo</a> made several days ago.</p>
<p>I can see how it might seem that technology, as it gradually performs more and more functions that our own bodies once performed by themselves (I'm channelling McLuhan here), would sap us of our individualism.  Human beings perform functions like hearing, writing, drawing, etc. in unique ways, but technology tends to standardize them.  (Witness the Industrial Revolution and the advent of interchangeable positions on the assembly line and interchangeable mechanical parts, as magoo points out.)</p>

I admit it; I was reading Marie Claire, a fashion magazine that isn't even that good in the scheme of fashion magazines. But in between the Sarah Jessica Parker interview and fall's fashion preview (it's all about tweed) there was an article about the effect of technology on young women's lives. Marie Claire asked two women to participate in an "experiment." One woman stopped using technology (the magazine threw this term around loosely, the woman didn't start living like the Amish, she just didn't use email, instant messenger, and stuff like that) and the other woman had to rely entirely on the Internet (she even had to order food online).</p>

I read the whole thing and can find nowhere in which Armstrong shows that the concept of individualism was not simply a manifestation of society that the novel has mirrored</cite>, and as follow up to our class discussion, here's an attempt to put some perspective on the modern subject--and hence, on Armstrong's potentially outrageous claim that, during the late eighteenth-century, "novels were acquiring the power to endow their readers with individuality" (3)--by giving it a relative framework.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, in section 3 of the Bush reading, he asks, "...will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record?"</p>
<p>When I first read that, I said, "haha," and then  remembered that the technology does in fact exist. I could buy some software and voila! I could talk to my computer and it would do the typing for me.</p>
<p>...right. I would never, ever do that. It would hurt my brain.</p>
<p>Do any of you have experience with this software? I know of one blogger who uses it, but it seems like it's uncommon. Obviously it's not perfect software, which is part of the problem (after all, if you're spending time correcting errors, you might as well just type)--but I wonder if there's a deeper issue with the idea of speaking writing instead of writing it. Ong talked about how literacy has shaped the way we think, but at least personally, I <em>can't</em> think unless I write, at least not as well or as articulately (not that I'm articulate here). I'm attached to the physical process of writing, to actually feeling words form, and speaking and then seeing the words appear on the screen doesn't quite cut it.</p>
