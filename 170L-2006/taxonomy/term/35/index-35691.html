<p>While I agree with Frabby that the style and visual presentation of these two e-texts are worlds apart, I'm not sure that the thematic content is that different.  At all.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We've already pointed out how Hayles talks lots about the importance of looking at print as a medium just as much as any other medium. That discussion got me thinking about the body in general. In "Material Met" she writes that there was an "emphasis on literary property as an intellectual construction that owed nothing to the medium in which it was embodied--With significant exceptions, print literature was widely regarded as not having a body, only a speaking mind" (32).<br />
Now Hayles is making a point about the importance of incorporating the material into the analysis of a text, not a point about the nature of physical bodies. But still--it made me think. We've taken our own bodies out of the equation when we post blog entries, run websites, even have IM conversations. I'm not sure what my larger point about this is. I just think it's a pretty strange situation when you have relationships with people and you don't need to involve your body in said relationship. There's a strong desire to want to remove your flawed, unreliable, mortal self, and computers make that possible. Of course any mass-produced text allows the author to remove themselves from the readers' minds. But those authors weren't really engaging in intimate, back and forth relationships with readers. Now we even have online dating situations where people can engage in dating before dealing with the body. That seems a bit ridiculous to me and a wildly bad idea. Isn't the body half the equation?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>1. I was really pleased by this statement (from page 99 of Writing Machines): "Contrary to much hype about electronic hypertext, books like <em>A Humument</em> allow the reader considerably more freedom of movement and access than do many electronic fictions."</p>
<p>...yep. I don't really have anything to say about that, except that I agree completely and so I wanted to point it out. Even if in hypertexty novels (like <em>House of Leaves</em>, which I love) we aren't making "choices" the way we do in electronic literature, we <em>are</em> able to make actual informed choices--like choosing to read the last page--instead of just clicking things at random. Hayles points out that "logical ordering and linear sequencing" are just as important as association (75), and while not all books are chronological, there is at least some sense of order, of beginning and end. And of course we can bookmark, highlight, etc. to our heart's content, which we can't do in hypertexts.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Because I read Hayles's description and explanation of "Lexia to Perplexia" before I actually looked at Memmot's work, I was surprised how much it overwhelmed me and gave me a headache.  I couldn't click a back button, so I was often trapped in loops.  Once I clicked on Memmot's name, for instance, and kept seeing Egyptian symbols and circles.  I clicked around but couldn't find an exit, so I became frustrated and quit.  Then I reentered the site, began reading the "Minifestos" (which I actually liked because of the scroll-over definitions of words), but then accidentally clicked on a link that forced me to exit the site.  I should have believed Hayles when she said "Lexia" is "a very 'nervous' document" (57).  I felt almost completely out of control, and the bright, flashing lines and messages (which I initially thought were cool) frustrated me when I couldn't read the text or make sense of what I read.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I didn't really understand the point of renaming the narrator of the story in "Writing Machines" Kaye.  The author makes it fairly unambiguous that these are, indeed, her own experiences, so why is she hiding behind a pseudonym?  What does this mean about her attitude towards her work and her own thought process, or even worse, to her life?  She gets all offended when Michael Joyce and the other hypertext greats back away from the medium, but isn't that what she's doing herself in not using her real name in the story of her discovery of it (the medium)?  While the book was good, this really bothered me.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Like Natwwal, I also really enjoyed Larsen's "Disappearing Rain."  I agree with Natwwal that the story is well-suited to the hypertext medium.  Just like Amy in the story, I was also searching for the answer.  I felt like the process that I was going through to reach an answer mirrored Amy's journey to find her sister.  I clicked on different links, hoping that each new one would lead me closer to an answer, and even if there was a disconnect between one link and the next, it was still hopeful because it felt like I was piecing together a puzzle. </p>
<p>At one point Sophie mentions a "modern electronic trap" and the narrator mentions how Amy needed to "systematically go to each URL on the list" as a means of getting closer to finding an answer.  As I was clicking on this link and that, I felt that I WAS Amy.  As much as she was trying to find her sister, I was also trying to find Anna.  This hypertext was the perfect example of how the medium enhanced the content.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Let me begin by saying what a relief it was to read "Writing Machines."  I had read a bit of Hayles for an AfroFuturisms class I took with Professor Val Thomas on African American Science Fiction.  For that class, I grappled with Hayles's definition of posthumanism, something I think I'll never fully understand because it is too abstract and theorized for my brain to process.  "Writing Machines" was much easier to understand.  Sure, as silversprung pointed out, there are passages that I didn't comprehend, but I think the way in which the book was written really helped my understanding.  Unlike thisismycheese, I enjoyed the design.  True, I didn't always understand why the magnified portions were magnified, but they didn't hurt of reading, and I liked the break in monotony.  Also, one of my favorite parts was the portions of autobiography.  I still don't completely understand if "Kaye's" life and thoughts differ at all from Katherine's.  (As Katherine says on page 10, Kaye shares autobiographical elements from her life, but they are not the same person.  But Hayles also says in her acknowledgements that "inventing a persona" allowed her to "work through the barriers I had thrown up around the idea of autobiography so I could finally see it" (142), so I assume that Kaye is Kate, just transformed into words on a page).  It is through these stories that I came to an understanding, with Kaye, that hypertext is not necessarily on a electronic text, and that "books are more than encoded voices; they are physical artifacts whose material properties offer potent resources for creating meaning" (107). Kaye's stories and other ones that Hayles's inserts, such as Danielewski's relationship and story to his father, made the book much more enjoyable.</p>

<p>"As we work toward critical practices and theories appropriate for electronic literature, we may come to renewed appreciation for the specificity of print.  In the tangled web of medial ecology, change anywhere in the system stimulates change everywhere in the system.  Books are not going the way of the dinosaur but the way of the human, changing as we change, mutating and evolving in ways that will continue, as a book lover said long ago, to teach and delight" (33).</p>
<p>Finally, none of these dire predictions about the end of books!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I was looking through the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/hypermedia/talan_memmott/">Lexia to Perplexia site</a>, staring at the pages with signs, symbols, and chopped-up words, I couldn't help but feel like this was more like postmodern art than any type of new literature.  The images reminded me a lot about the type of drawings and paintings in modern art museums that perplex me but supposedly have a message.  Since I'm personally very bad at interpreting art and have very little patience with art in general, I'm usually left more frustrated than enlightened.  I am no expert at postmodern or any art, really, but I do feel like postmodern art has this edgy, deconstructive aspect to it, and that much of postmodern art tries very hard to criticize or satirize more traditional art forms in this witty, ironic way.  I had the exact same feeling when I was browsing the Lexia to Perplexia site. I felt like this was an art form, in which the message was not so much the content itself, but more the medium.  And though Memmott says that his work was not intended to be critical but more "fictive," I still felt like there was an inherent critical aspect to his art.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The design of "Writing Machines" is clearly important--the designer is credited a lot more thoroughly than usual, and in the preface Hayles refers to the work as collaboration. Yet 50 pages in, the design hasn't enhanced my experience of reading the book. Its main purpose, as far as I can tell, is to lead me toward the meanings that Hayles wants me to make.</p>
<p>What I mean is--almost all the other texts I have read have left it up to me to underline, dog-ear, highlight--they've left a lot of that user-end meaning creation up to me.</p>
<p>Am I misinterpreting what she's doing with the enlarged text/underlined words? I feel like she's trying to direct my reading in a really unsubtle way--it's like buying a used book at Huntley and finding that the person before you highlighted a bunch of things that you don't necessarily think should be highlighted.</p>
