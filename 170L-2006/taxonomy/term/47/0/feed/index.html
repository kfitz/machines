 <title>My future as career as a blogger</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/458</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As my senior year flies by, the most common and irritating question I&#039;m confronted with is, &quot;So, what are you going to do next year?&quot;   I suppose this question would be more enjoyable if I had a good answer (&quot;Well right now I&#039;m fielding offers from several firms and it&#039;s probably going to really come down to signing bonuses and health benefits.&quot;)  But I don&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a joke, since being in this class, I&#039;ve started telling people I&#039;m going to be a blogger.  This rarely fails to impress my older relatives.  To them, being a blogger means being on the cutting edge of internet technology, instantly trading information across the world.  Why shouldn&#039;t a person be paid handsomely for that?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Blogs as the Emotional Pulse of the World (the Coolest Link Ever)</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/54</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wefeelfine.org/index.html&quot;&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt; is by far the most amazing site I&#039;ve seen relating to blogs.  A friend showed it to me and i was overwhelmed by the coolness.  Literally.  I had to close the window after a couple minutes and just sit there.  Digesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are so great.  Every ten minutes the site refreshes, pulling thousands of sentences containing the word feel/feeling and one of over 5000 emotions from blogs across the world.  Then it sorts them.  You can see how the world is feeling.  Or how women in Indonesia are feeling, or old men in Russia.  If there are pictures on the site where the blog was posted it associates the picture with the text.&lt;/p&gt;
