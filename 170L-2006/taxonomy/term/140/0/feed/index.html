 <title> The One Day in History Project</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/227</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, October 17, the British organization History Matters is organizing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historymatters.org.uk/output/page96.asp&quot;&gt;largest blogging event in history&lt;/a&gt;.  Asking all UK citizens to contribute a blog entry about their day which will become part of a &quot;mass blog for the national record.&quot;  The blog will be stored in the British National Library and serve as a detailed snapshot at individual lives in the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if future historians will be thrilled with this foresight or repulsed by the idea of slogging through thousands and thousands of blogs.  Also, I&#039;m curious how blogs will be viewed in context as historical documents.  Is a truly comprehensive picture of a historic era one that features every single voice of every person living in that time and place, as the ultimate goal of One Day in History seems to be?  Is there even any need for history if every voice is preserved?  Would it turn into more of a sociological profession, tracking social trends and the effects on the individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
