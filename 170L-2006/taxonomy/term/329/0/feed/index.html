 <title>Appendices</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/582</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently I&#039;m not the only one who found the process of writing an appendix for my final project to be somewhat bewildering or frustrating.  While I do not intend to quarrel with its necessity, I will admit that I felt like my project lost something in the process.  Maybe it&#039;s because I increasingly tried to get my project to convey a sense of ambiguity.  Maybe it&#039;s because I felt like explaining what I was trying to do robbed any of those who might read it of the chance to make certain connections for themselves.  Or maybe it&#039;s just that I had been seeing it from the inside for so long that I found it difficult to step back and attempt to consider it from an exterior perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
