    <div class="content"><p>I used to be a huge fan of Super Mario Brothers (back when we played on the old grey Nintendo box).  Today, I was remembering how, after my sister and I had been playing for an entire afternoon, the competition between Mario and Luigi would get pretty intense.  At times, I would find myself leaning to the left and right and jumping up and down as if, by moving my body, I could somehow more effectively move my player (I always had to be Luigi because my sister was older).  Sometimes, during her turn, I would press the buttons on my controller and jump up and down still believing that I could control her player.  Maybe I was just a little slow or caught up in the passion of Super Mario Brothers, but either way it seemed like I was really doing something at the time.</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="../../../node/265/index.html">Why aren&#039;t video game reviews more prevalent in the media?</a></h1>
      <span class="submitted">Submitted by Pimm on 23 October 2006 - 7:01pm.</span>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I'm still intrigued by our discussion at the end of class today on the lack of video game reviews/coverage in certain newspapers or magazines.  During our discussion, I kept thinking the reason why there aren't as many video game reviews, even if the gaming industry is larger than the film industry, is a result of the demographics of who plays.  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cms/games/opening.html">This transcript</a> from a speech given by Doug Lowenstein (with an intro by Hnery Jenkins) at a conference hosted by MIT shows that I was wrong.  Granted, this speech was written in 2000, so I definitely need to update my statistics (which I'm having trouble doing), but it showed me that adolescent boys aren't the majority of the users.  For example, Lowenstein says of the most frequent users of video games console software, "We found that 65% were male, and 35% were female. 46% of the most frequent users of console games were under 18. 54% were over 18, and an astonishing one fourth was over 36 years old."  This made me even more confused why video games aren't more widely covered in the media.  Maybe, as someone in class pointed out today, true video game users spend so much time dedicated to play that they wouldn't be the ones writing the reviews.  And perhaps the people who control the more "respectable" newspapers/media have the same stereotype of video game users as I do (meaning, adolescent boys play, so those reviews don't need to be in, say, The New Yorker).</p>

But I came across <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001328.html">this interesting article</a> in the Washington Post that talks about a video game called Re-Mission, developed by the nonprofit Hope Labs in Palo Alto, that is geared toward children suffering from cancer.  In the game, players fight cancer in a patient's body, and in the process, learn about the biology of cancer and what kinds of behaviors can help those undergoing treatment recover more quickly.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have really enjoyed the trips down memory lane.  I too remember the joys of Oregon Trail and, during my recollections, I remember how ridiculously low tech it was.  As many of you may recall, in order to shoot the rabbit, buffalo, or whatever else happened to run across the screen during an Oregon Trail hunting excursion, you had to shoot about one inch in front of it.  Overall, the game's characters were pretty one-dimensional, the graphics weren't great and the storyline was dull. (I recall never feeling sad at the loss of a "family member.")  Yet, I loved it and so did the rest of Mrs. West's fourth grade class.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've really enjoyed reading everybody's posts on videogaming, confessions, and the like.  It seems like the topic of video games is broad enough that everyone has their own personal stories and memories of what videogaming means to them, whether it be Sims-style creations or the shoot-and-kill variety like CS and Diablo.  What about happy memories of games like Oregon Trail, or Carmen Sandiego in elementary school? Does anyone remember playing video games, or rather, computer games in schools?  </p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061017/ap_on_sc/video_games">This article</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5398230.stm">this article</a> talks about the various effects of using computer games in school. I feel like the idea of harnessing the popular appeal and power of video games and using them as an educational tool in schools has been around for at least a decade.  The author of the first article writes that "scientists call it [video games] the next great discovery, a way to captivate students so much they will spend hours learning on their own."  I feel like it's a little late to make a statement such as this, since educational video games have been around for a while now and companies learned long ago that videogames are the "next great discovery."  The points that the article makes, though, definitely hold true and I can personally identify with a lot of this from grade school memories.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I had never really thought about video games seriously before the last couple weeks.  But the readings, class discussions, and blog posts caused me to look back on my own gaming experiences and compare them to my experiences with other arts.  One major facet of gameplaying, total different from my relation to other art froms, emerged: Competition.</p>
<p>The best games I played lured me into a war.  Immersion for me was throwing the controller when I lost, punching walls, and then feeling angry and silly for hours.  I have thrown books, shut off CD players in a rage, crumpled up artwork, but it was always because they were bad and I could tell, not because I was bad and the art had beaten me.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'd be interested in hearing about more examples of very immersive books or games in which form calls attention to itself or that mix game and narrative. I'm not yet familiar with the examples mentioned in class, so I'm having trouble refining the idea. </p>
<p>Here's what I have so far. </p>
<p>1) We find games that involve less aspects of narrative to be more immersive.<br />
2) We find narratives that involve less aspects of gameplay to be more immersive. </p>
<p>Apparently, exceptions exist. An examination of how these exceptions mix the two might show much of how each and both operate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I suspect that stories and games become less immersive as they blend because the two forms relate to perceived reality in conflicting ways. Stories represent perceived reality. Games do not.  In the sense that I mean this, it's not less true of fanciful stories or photorealistic games. No one asks whether baseball is more or less realistic than football. Chess and even go are often supposed to be representative of war, but having played both for years, I don't see how. Computer games create worlds that involve extensive representation of familiar elements, but I'd argue that insofar as the user plays a game, the representational elements' primary function is to intuitively establish game rules. That is, if one sees a wall, one realizes that an obstacle exists without having to check the manual. In many RPG's, when one sees a bottle or a drumstick, that represents some capacity one can gain for one's avatar. Representational elements contribute to crucial semantics of play in ways that create a different world. The play world is not true or false, but different. Conversely, critics and readers reduce the fluffiest romance or the most unsubstantiated scifi to basic human desires and conflicts, however stylized. And we can talk extensively about particular nuances in the way the story is or is not authentic or truthful.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I was excited to see that <em>First Person</em> talks about gaming, as that topic has spawned a few of the more interesting conversations on this blog. What I wasn't expecting was how closely the articles would tie in with the conversations we've been having about electronic literature--and particularly the complains a lot of us have made about the artificiality/awkwardness of the e-lit we've looked at.</p>
<p>In Bryan Loyall's response to the first article (Janet Murray's) he writes: "One property of Murray's three main examples is that the participant is consciously aware of the story and actively manipulating it. These forms give powerful ways to tell new types of stories, but for me, <strong>one of the joys of a story is when I forget about it being a story. I am simply there.</strong>"</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After reading the first chapter of First Person, I was struck by the fact that many of the authors seem to assume that a gamer "becomes" the character they are playing. I think that with many RPGs, part of the appeal is that you can create a character who may be nothing like yourself.  In this sense, some RPGs are more interactive story boards than interactive stories.  I would roughly divide games into three categories:<br />
1.  Games where "you" are the hero (e.g. Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego) 2.  Games where you play a character other than yourself and are fairly contrained in terms of that character's personality and story (e.g. Halo), and 3. Games that set up the geography and rules of a world, but that allow you a great deal of freedom to create your own character and storyline (e.g. Warcraft and most other RPGs).  I would argue that games of the third variety don't necessarily come from a first-person</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In reading Ken Perlin's essay on finding an intermediate form between games and stories, I've started to wonder whether his pursuit of a middle ground is entirely possible and whether consumers would be satisfied with the results.  </p>
<p>He contrasts the non-agency of reading books or watching movies with the hyper-agency we experience when we play video games, calling for the creation of a suitable form that can properly combine both.  I think during this current stage of videogaming, Wright's response to Perlin's essay is a more relevant and realistic discussion, especially when he says he wants players to "play better stories."  That seems most important to me; I feel like that strategy stays true to the goal of games while also respecting player agency.</p>
