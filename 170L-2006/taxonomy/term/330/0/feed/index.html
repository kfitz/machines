 <title>Make your own Zork!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/585</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes a little bit of fooling around to get the hang of, but you guys have to try this - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classicgaming.com/ascii/download_files/textworld/textworld.html&quot;&gt;create your own text-based adventure game&lt;/a&gt;.  It ends up being just like Zork, or Adventure.  The program is called Text World, and basically you create rooms, which have descriptive intros, and make exits from the room, which you can block until the player uses an item, which you can also place in the room, and tell it what they need to type to find that item.  I don&#039;t so much get the &quot;create life form&quot; option, but in my game that I made for my boyfriend, the attempt at that one ends up getting killed when we &quot;give guard crack cocaine.&quot;  But I don&#039;t think he was blocking the entrance, so much.  He is just there to &quot;remove lifeform.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
