 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was reading Hayles&#039;s &quot;Writing Machines,&quot; I couldn&#039;t help but feel skeptical about...well, to be brutally honest, the entire point.  I actually agreed with and was sympathetic to a lot of Hayles&#039; points about media ecology, the bathtub theory of literature, and the continual evolution and enhancement of books alongside the progression of electronic literature.  In fact, I really loved when she said &quot;as we work toward critical practices and theories appropriate for electronic literature, we may come to renewed appreciation for the specificity of print.&quot; (33)  However, despite all these great points that I could sympathize with, I was also skeptical about a lot of things, and in particular her analysis of electronic literature like &quot;Lexia to Perplexia.&quot;  I&#039;m not critical as to the actual content or analysis.  Instead, I guess my discomfort stems from a lack of clarity as to who the audience is, and the actual value of literary criticism.  So, I guess this entry isn&#039;t just a straightforward critique of an assigned reading.  It&#039;s more a pondering of why I am reading what I&#039;m reading and the usefulness of what I&#039;m learning.&lt;/p&gt;
