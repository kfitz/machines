 <title>Agency</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/260</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of the theory we&#039;ve been reading lately about games has attributed a good-sized share of the &quot;immersiveness&quot; of video games to the notion of agency in that we&#039;re not being pulled along by the capriciousness of authorial intent, but are rather able to freely explore within the boundaries of the game system.  Having grown up on games with interfaces sophisticated enough, or at least designed well enough to at least project the illusion of transparency, I found the experience of playing Adventure, and to a lesser extent Zork, to be incredibly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface for these games is so incredibly primitive that I did not feel a sense of immersion at all, except for a fleeting 3 minutes or so with Zork where it was all working, and the computer was not mysteriously denying my eminently reasonable requests.  It became easier as I grew somewhat acclimated to the system and what it could and could not do, but every few minutes, I would make what I thought was a common-sense command, and have it rebuffed.  Bang.  Immersion shattered.  For example, during most of my time spent with Adventure, I was being pursued through the damn catacombs by a dwarf who would throw &quot;tiny knives&quot; at me and then retreat whenever he got bored.  I had an axe at the time, so I tried to use it on the little freak.  No dice.&lt;/p&gt;
