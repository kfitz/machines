 <title>Reading Implementation and Skin</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/356</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I realized exactly what I&#039;d be reading, I printed out the &quot;letters&quot;/pages from Implementation as if I&#039;d be reading an article or a novel (which, actually, the authors claim it is).  Boy was I mistaken.  Some of the story lines were easy to follow, but often the dialogue completely switched topics from one paragraph to the next.  I had thought it was a bit ambitious for the authors to say  Implementation is a &quot;novel about psychological warfare, American imperialism, sex, terror, identity, and the idea of place, a project.&quot;  After all, that&#039;s a lot of topics for a short novel.  But once I started reading, I saw that these sudden changes of topic and interweaving of stories allowed for so much ground to be covered.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Feral Hypertexts</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/352</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Jill Walker&#039;s discussion of feral hypertext in When Hypertext Literature Escapes Control.  Many of the topics/points she raises are ones we have talked about in class or on the blog.  For instance, I thought Steve Himmer&#039;s quote on page 2--&quot;absence of a discrete, &#039;completed&#039; product makes the weblog as a form resistant to the commodization either of itself, or of any one particular interpretation&quot;--fit with the conversation Frabby raised in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/313&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; entry on personal blogs gone wrong.  Another topic we talk about in class was raised by Walker on page 4, when she says that despite that readers feel like co-authors when reading hypertexts, they may actually have less control because they can&#039;t read the end of the story first like in conventional fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>some thoughts on Joyce</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/117</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading Michael Joyce&#039;s &quot;Afternoon: A Story&quot; was confusing, to say the least. I was very anxious while reading it, and there was a point at which I kept going in circles.  I tried going back and changing my choices, but I&#039;d end up on the same several pages again and again...it took me a while to backtrack enough so that I could end up somewhere new.  If there&#039;s no coherent plot, does that make this &quot;story&quot; still a story?  I understand Joyce&#039;s point that we should participate in the creation of a text and give our own meaning to a story, but if that detracts from our comprehension of the story itself, then is the exercise futile?  I tend to agree with thisismycheese&#039;s point that Joyce seems to be using the technology for the sake of it, rather than because his particular &quot;story&quot; is well-suited for this medium.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Machines are taking over!   well, not really...</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/81</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I read Burnett&#039;s article, I kept thinking about the millions of movies I&#039;ve seen in which robots take over the human world and wreck havoc on us.  I was reminded of films like &quot;I, Robot&quot; (a movie which I&#039;ve never actually seen but apparently involves robots taking over the world) and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series.  Hollywood seems to enjoy portraying robots as dangerous creatures with the power to destroy their own human creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnett also brings up the power struggle between humans and machines. He says there&#039;s a &quot;&#039;natural&#039; and negative &#039;gut&#039; reaction to the idea that machines may have more power than humans do.&quot; (123) I wonder, though, if this fear of technology and machines&#039; &quot;power&quot; is a bit over-exaggerated and silly.  Yes, computers are powerful, but they&#039;re only powerful because humans gave them that power. Yes, a computer beat Garry Kasparov during a game of chess, but it was humans who programmed the computers to calculate in the first place.  I am also unclear--and pretty skeptical--as to the usefulness of the debate about machines threatening human individuality.  Perhaps I&#039;m simplifying the situation too much, but to be perfectly frank, I often have a hard time figuring out why people like Burnett are just so fixed on anthropomorphizing machines. I see machines as machines.  When he asks questions like &quot;Can a machine feel pain?&quot;(126) I am not sure at all how to answer his question.  I even wonder, &quot;Is he seriously asking this question?!&quot; WHY is he asking this?  Perhaps I am too practical a person and cannot use my imagination.  Then again, my other cynical side tells me that humans are just egotistical and obsessed with themselves and therefore must attribute human qualities to everything.  An annoyingly frustrating endeavor, in my opinion...&lt;/p&gt;
