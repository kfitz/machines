 <title>Caroline and Jemma</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/288</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know why, but I just have to force myself to be anything more than the tiniest bit interested in the stories at &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinecaroline.com/&quot;&gt;onlinecaroline.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://planetjemma.com/&quot;&gt;planetjemma.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Having to put in my email address already makes me cranky, and thinking about getting emails from these sites makes me realize that I will probably do what I do with all other emails, which is leave them piling up unread for as long as possible while I assure myself I will read them later.  I don&#039;t know what it is...I&#039;m still trying to figure out my stubborn resistance to it all.  Something about getting these standard responses to my interactions with the characters...  I don&#039;t really want to fill in my personal details and answer quizzes so I can get these limited replies...won&#039;t it probably just come down to how much I can mess with the format and try to get unique responses?  I haven&#039;t read through all of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; yet, but I&#039;m immediatly more interested in it.  Reading something that I can pretend is personal and real is more captivating for me than reading emails that are trying to make you think they&#039;re personal and real because, really, all their trying does is make it more obvious that they&#039;re not what they&#039;re trying to be.  Does that make sense?  These are my early impressions so who knows, maybe I&#039;ll get more drawn into the stories of &quot;Caroline&quot; and &quot;Jemma&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Planet Jemma and the teenage girl problem</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/287</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just spent some time fiddling around with PlanetJemma.  The whole time I had this feeling like I shouldn&#039;t be there.  Like I had stumbled into a chatroom for teenage girls and what was I doing playing around with the sparkly cursor and bloopy type about boys and some missing girl named Abby and how cool science is?  I thought this was maybe just my pretentious version of the &quot;if it&#039;s something a teenage girl would like, or could do, it&#039;s bad&quot; syndrome we talked about earlier in the semester in relation to some A-list bloggers refusal to view Livejournal as a real blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I did a little research to see who had created this PlanetJemma and for what purpose.  Turns out it&#039;s funded by the British Council because &quot;Girls in Britain do well in science exams. Then as they get older, drop the subject like a hot Bunsen burner.&quot;  Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misbehaving.net/2003/10/planet_jemma.html&quot;&gt;this site&lt;a /&gt; for more info.  So it wasn&#039;t my personal shortcomings (or narrow perspective) that caused me to dislike and feel uncomfortable in the site, it&#039;s designed specifically to target teenage girls, explaining all the fuchsias.&lt;/p&gt;
