 <title>A bit lost</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/33</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m feeling a bit lost regarding what we want this blog to be.  The Writing Machines Blog.  So far it seems to be of the fubu, for us by us, variety.  Which is fine.  We trade links we feel will pertain to the class and stimulate discussion.  We probe and comment on the assigned readings.  We reference one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&#039;m confused about is whether blogs owe something to the general public.  They are open forums.  On the remote chance that some random individual stumbles upon the Writing Machines blog is it our duty as bloggers to try to interest them in the content?  To give them something that will make them want to read more, and maybe even link to us?  I&#039;m so used to public literature that does this.  In every creative writing and journalism class I&#039;ve taken the primary focus has been on engaging and holding the interest of the reader.  There&#039;s a relationship between writer and reader.  When you publish something you want your audience to read and enjoy it, so you try to make it readable and enjoyable.  The blogs linked to(blogroll) on this page all do that.  They have humor, or continuous narrative, or subject matter that appeals to either the general or a niche audience, or some hook to keep readers coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt;
