 <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/technology/11soprano.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about how A&amp;amp;E is using an online/out in the real world hybrid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suitcaseofcash.com/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; to get people interested in watching the Sopranos reruns that A&amp;amp;E is set to play starting early January.  So again it&#039;s this strategy of game as marketing tool, and I&#039;m still curious as to how successful these things are and what kind of people are the ones who participate in these game/ads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article has the requisite quote from some person who will sound educated, in this case a quote from a professor at USC (the cali one):  &quot;They want to express themselves in a community,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case the community is of people excited about &#039;The Sopranos.&#039; I think it is a natural flowing from this sort of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_age&quot;&gt;participation age&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;  People wanting to express themselves in a community...this is something I&#039;ve been thinking about a lot lately as people have been talking about identity online.  The way in which games are serving as a way for people to express themselves within a community...this is something that I&#039;m interested in but I don&#039;t really know where to go with it yet.  And then when the game is also an advertisement, how does that factor in?&lt;/p&gt;
