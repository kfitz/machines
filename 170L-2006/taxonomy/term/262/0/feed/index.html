 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m in a wonderful class at CMC called &quot;Women&#039;s Magazines and the Female Journalist&quot;, and yesterday our professor arranged a panel of speakers for a lunch at the Athenaeum.  These four female journalists--the co-founders of &lt;a href=&quot;//www.bitchmagazine.com/index.html &quot;&gt;Bitch: Feminist Response to Pop Culture magazine&lt;/a&gt;, the editor of &lt;a href=&quot;//www.msmagazine.com/&quot;&gt;Ms. Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and a graduate of Pomona who is a staff writer for the East Bay Express--offered great advice and insight into the world of journalism.  They also (and here&#039;s why I&#039;m posting to this) replied to a question about the future of journalism in light of the popularity of reading blogs and news online.  Almost all women agreed that they don&#039;t necessarily feel threatened by the web.  As one said, &#039;I think the rumors of the end of the print word are ridiculously exaggerated.&quot;  Of course, it would make sense for them to feel this way because, although their publications have websites, their careers are reliant on print.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mixing Worlds: Social Software and Books</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/423</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can talk to a Honnold/Mudd librarian online?  It was a funny concept to me, yet last Saturday I was eager to do it.  The most ironic part of me using this service from the library is that the reason I was using &quot;librarianchat&quot; was that I could avoid having to read online versions of articles and books.  That&#039;s right: I had found some sources for my final research paper for a class, but I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown because the only versions I could find were online.  So I turned to talking to the librarian over AIM.  (Another funny addition to the story is that I&#039;m usually on AIM all the time, but this semester I have been on it less and less, because it is such a huge distraction and I have been bombarded with work.)  Anyway, I signed online, talked to the librarian (who used all capital letters, which suddenly made me feel like I was a preteen and should be using them too), and figured out how I could get print editions.&lt;/p&gt;
