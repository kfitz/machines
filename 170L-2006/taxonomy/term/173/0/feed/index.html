 <title>Planet Jemma and the teenage girl problem</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/287</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just spent some time fiddling around with PlanetJemma.  The whole time I had this feeling like I shouldn&#039;t be there.  Like I had stumbled into a chatroom for teenage girls and what was I doing playing around with the sparkly cursor and bloopy type about boys and some missing girl named Abby and how cool science is?  I thought this was maybe just my pretentious version of the &quot;if it&#039;s something a teenage girl would like, or could do, it&#039;s bad&quot; syndrome we talked about earlier in the semester in relation to some A-list bloggers refusal to view Livejournal as a real blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I did a little research to see who had created this PlanetJemma and for what purpose.  Turns out it&#039;s funded by the British Council because &quot;Girls in Britain do well in science exams. Then as they get older, drop the subject like a hot Bunsen burner.&quot;  Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misbehaving.net/2003/10/planet_jemma.html&quot;&gt;this site&lt;a /&gt; for more info.  So it wasn&#039;t my personal shortcomings (or narrow perspective) that caused me to dislike and feel uncomfortable in the site, it&#039;s designed specifically to target teenage girls, explaining all the fuchsias.&lt;/p&gt;
