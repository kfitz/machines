 <title>Webcams gone wrong</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/326</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to investigate &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennicam&quot;&gt; Jennicam&lt;/a&gt;, the webcam girl who was mentioned briefly in class on Monday.  Wikipedia&#039;s information on her was interesting, but the information I stumbled upon that was linked that page was even more fascinating.  I clicked on another Wikipedia page entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_whore&quot;&gt; Cam Whores&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, which, according to Wikipedia, is &quot;a term for people who expose themselves on the Internet with webcam software in exchange for goods, usually via enticing viewers to purchase items on their wishlists or add to their online accounts.&quot;  To learn more, I clicked on a link on that page to an article in The New York Times from December 2005 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/national/19kids.ready.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;en=aea51b3919b2361a&amp;amp;ex=1292648400&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt; Justin Berry&lt;/a&gt;, a boy who at the age of 13 began using webcams in order to get more friends and ended up basically starting a pornography business.  For five years, he brought in tons of money from pedophiles.  There&#039;s a link on the left side to a 7-part interview series from the NY Times on him, and it is incredibly sad, moving, and fascinating.  His story, both about how he began his business and why he chose to end it by turning in himself and all his files to the FBI, made me think of our class for a few reasons, some more obvious than others.  First of all, I asked earlier about the word voyeurism, and this definitely seems like an example of it.  Secondly, when he talked about the pedophiles (who, creepily enough often ended up being people who work with children, such as teachers, pediatricians, and child lawyers), he mentions how he thought of them as &quot;friends,&quot; though the friendship was completely constructed and often built on lies and an artificial web relationship.  Does this remind anyone else of Jemma?  Of course I&#039;m not saying that Jemma played the role of either pedophile or pornographer, but it did ring a bell with me and made her forced friendship feel even more odd (and the promotion of her site to, say, teenagers as wrong).  Finally, Justin turned over the conversations he had with his &quot;customers&quot; that were logged on the computer, so, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;-style, the FBI could (and is currently, I think) investigate them in a huge lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
