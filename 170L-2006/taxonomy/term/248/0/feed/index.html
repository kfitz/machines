 <title>Kudos</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to considerable preoccupation with other work, I&#039;ve been on something of a break from the wiki for the past two or three weeks, so in coming back to it I felt like I needed to completely catch up/reorient myself before I could begin posting again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having returned to it, for a time, with an objectivity of absence that made me much more a reader than a collaborating author, I would just like to offer our class a congratulatory pat on the back.  This thing is genuinely fun to read. The lexias are frequently witty, well-written, and interesting in their own right, and the linking system really seems like it &quot;works&quot; in the sense that the links mostly lead down worthwhile, often surprising paths, and getting lost in all the linking feels &lt;cite&gt;fun&lt;/cite&gt;, not wildly frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Google Docs</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/430</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet more in the vein of collaborative writing-- has anyone checked out Google docs yet?  I kept expecting it to come up in class yesterday, especialy when we were talking about Sophie.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Google acquired Writely--a text editing program that allows multiple people to work on the same document simultaneously, sort of a bare-bones, online MS Word--about six months ago.  Since then, they&#039;ve integrated the Writely features into the Google buffet of options, so that now anyone with a Google account can upload and store their documents through Google Docs.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.google.com/&quot;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt; if you haven&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Novel Twists, collective fictions of days gone by</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/402</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In my search for online images and backgrounds for my final project, I came across a site that reminded me a lot of Shelley Jackson&#039;s Skin.  The site is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noveltwists.com/&quot;&gt;Novel Twists&lt;/a&gt;, and it basically is a piece of collaborative fiction comprised of a total of 150 pages, and people bid for the right to contribute a page.  I tried to find the ebay aunction site where this was going on, but I failed.  It&#039;s probably privatized or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this project is very similar to Jackson&#039;s Skin.  It also relies on the premise that this is a collaborative project with a limited number of participants who don&#039;t know each other.  Here, though, the participants aren&#039;t as thoroughly screened as those in Jackson&#039;s project.  Rather, the winner/writer of each page goes to the highest bidder, and then all the proceeds go to charity.  Quite an interesting way to raise money, don&#039;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
