 <title>life in blog</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/328</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been blogging for a pretty long time--more than six and a half years, or close to a third of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creepy? A little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that some very weird things have happened on/around my blog, and I am going to share one particularly weird experience here, because I am thinking of mining some of it for my final project. (It&#039;s one of those things that&#039;s so surreal that it seems a shame not to use it toward some more-or-less productive end--) This anecdote is at least among the top five weirdest things that have happened to me on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Memories of Blog</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/19</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;During our first class meetings and the intervening time,I was unable to recall a time when I had actually read a blog regularly or for its own sake.  Sure, I had had them linked for me .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friend on AIM: &quot;u have to check this out!!...link&quot; or sometimes just &quot;link&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Me: &quot;...haha...that&#039;s kind of funny I guess.&quot; (Dear god, this sucks.  Why are they linking it for me?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or sometimes I had run into them when googling for something that might actually be useful.  However, I usually found the format of the blog itself to be repellant.  Without fail, the information I was actually seeking would be buried deep within the back-entries, and I would realize that I really didn&#039;t give enough of a damn to sift through the blogger&#039;s breathless attempts to make their life seem interesting to perfect strangers.  After all, there were about 200,000 other google results that would probably be more helpful and less painful to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
