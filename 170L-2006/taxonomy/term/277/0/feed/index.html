 <title>Creating Characters</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/436</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My final project is about online identity construction, fragmentation and multiplicity.  As I&#039;ve been thinking about the different perspectives on these issues, I&#039;ve had a hard time reconciling the fact that we can, in certain online settings, create a character that doesn&#039;t have much to do with ourselves.  Yet, I reject the view that the online space is a vacuum, uninformed by the real world and the &quot;real&quot; person creating identity online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across a passage in &quot;Life on the Screen&quot; by Sherry Turkle.  In it, she is discussing Gordon who dropped out of school after his fresman year in college to pursue a career in computer programming.  Gordon apparently also spends a lot of time on MUDs (multi-user dungeons) playing and creating different characters.  In her discussions with Gordon, he mentions how certain characters are like himself or not like himself, yet he is always talking about them in relation to his own identity.  In a bizarre twist, Gordon found his fiancee on a MUD.  The relationship began when one of his characters began a relationship with one of her characters.&lt;/p&gt;
