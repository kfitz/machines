 <title>Territoriality vs. Collaboration</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/432</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the discussion we had yesterday in class about authorship in a collaborative work, I wanted to delve a bit into the problem of authority on wikipedia.  In browsing through Many to Many, I was most interested in the &quot;debate&quot; between Clay Shirkey and Larry Sanger about whether primacy should be given to &quot;experts&quot; in the editing of various wikipedia pages.  Shirkey quotes a comment that the debate drew, the most interesting part of which (I thought) was &quot;Wikipedia has seen several recent incidents, including one this month, where notable scientists have joined the project and engaged in patterns of edits which demonstrated utter contempt for other editors of the encyclopedia (many of whom were also PhD-holding scientists, though lesser known), attempted to &quot;own&quot; pages, attempted to portray conjecture or unpublished research as fact, or have exaggerated the importance or quality of their own work. When challenged, said editors have engaged in (predictable) tirades accusing the encyclopedia of anti-intellectualism and anti-expert bias--charges we&#039;ve all heard before.&quot;  While I cannot speak to the validity of this statement, if it is true it highlights a relatively ugly debate lurking behind the apparently harmonious face of wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Who&#039;s Who on the Group Sites</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/407</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been reading the Many to Many site and I was interested by a couple posts that are thinking about identifying exactly who is doing what on these social sites.  The first post, by Danah Boyd is about comScore&#039;s alleged misinterpretation of data about MySpace.  Apparently comScore&#039;s statistics show that many people over 34 are using MySpace. Boyd first points out that there is a difference between people who visit the site and people who actually use it (have accounts).  Second, Boyd poses the question of how we can say who is actually making and using the accounts.  As she points out, the statistics show that there are more 100+ people using MySpace than are even alive.  Also, people post that they are one age and then their picture looks much, much younger.  She says that many teenagers are using their parents computers which may cause statistics about user age to be artificially high.&lt;/p&gt;
