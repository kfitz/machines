 <title>Library Thing</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/374</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that we&#039;re going to be looking at networked writing next week, and this website falls under that, but I&#039;m going to jump the gun and talk about it anyways--because I am kind of disconcerted about my experience with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.librarything.com/&quot;&gt;LibraryThing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like somebody talked about a similar website earlier, where you could look at other people&#039;s catalogued favorite music/books/movie, but I can&#039;t find the post, so sorry if this is a bit repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to my point: I spent a bit of time with LibraryThing today, and the whole thing has left me feeling very very not special. Every time I type in a favorite book, lists of my other favorite books come up tagged as well. It&#039;s almost eerie. Evidently there are thousands of people who have read the exact same things as me and then had similar reactions. I think what you read, what you really enjoy, reflects on you as a person. So I&#039;d like to think that I&#039;m a little bit original, a little bit quirky. Of course, the Internet begs to differ.&lt;/p&gt;
