 <title>Identity Unity and Fragmentation in Cyberspace</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/351</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just finished Daniel Punday&#039;s &quot;The Narrative Construction of Cyberspace: Reading Neuromancer, Reading Cyberspace Debates.&quot;  If you&#039;re interested, the article is on JStor.  He loosely bases his discussion on the novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; in which the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; is coined.  I personally have not read the novel and familiarity with it is not necessary to find the article helpful.  Punday begins showing how the concept is novelistic in origin which, to me, after all of our reading, also gestures toward the idea of cyberspace, and our experience online, as a metanarrative.  In general, many of the more recent theorists seem to see the internet as spatial and narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
