 <title>Celebrity Blogs</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/7</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose that this will be of little interest to academically minded students. But a lot of the stuff that I read online is gossip in some form or another, particularly celebrity gossip. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt&quot; /&gt;Oh No They Didn&#039;t&lt;/a&gt; as my primary source for straight information. It&#039;s a community live journal that&#039;s constantly updated by random contributors. I assume the posts are monitored for accuracy and general offensiveness by a group of moderators, but I haven&#039;t figured out exactly who runs it.&lt;br /&gt;
However, the more interesting blogs are those that take small bits of gossip and present them in a sassy manner. Among my favorites is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wwtdd.com/&quot;&gt;What Would Tyler Durden Do?&lt;/a&gt;. It&#039;s written by a random guy who doesn&#039;t seem to have much connection to actual celebrities. But his lack of exposure is made up for with his in-your-face, super politically incorrect style of writing. Finally the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://perezhilton.com&quot; /&gt;Perez Hilton&lt;/a&gt; is also kind of cool because he has become a minor celebrity in his own right due to his internet gossiping. He posts pictures of himself with B-List celebrities like Paris Hilton (note the name of the site) and somehow manages to hobnob with celebrities and trash them on his site.&lt;/p&gt;
