 <title>Surveillance and Censorship</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/429</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been thinking about surveillance and censorship on the Internet, and I just read magoo&#039;s post on privacy, and it&#039;s crazy because I&#039;m realizing I just don&#039;t know anything about all of this.  I keep stumbling across articles related to these things, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wired.com/news/technology/0,72104-0.html?tw=wn_index_2&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of them from Wired that talks about the results of a world-wide survey that is looking at government censorship in different nations.  One government claims to censor &quot;sexually explicit&quot; (whatever that means) materials, but what it actually censors are political and religious sites that don&#039;t quite agree with the ideas/policies of their regime.  Governments use all kinds of tricks, making you think you&#039;re trying to reach a page that doesn&#039;t exist (when it actually does), and then there&#039;s the DoS attacks, which I definitely knew nothing about (and now only kinda understand).  But, there are of course new browsers and products that allow individuals to get around all this censorship, and some individuals find other ways of fighting it-- this quote from the Wired article is crazy to me:&lt;/p&gt;
