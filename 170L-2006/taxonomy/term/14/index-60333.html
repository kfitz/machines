    <div class="content"><p>Waaaaay back in the beginning of the semester, I posted something about how blogging wasn't for perfectionists, because it thrives on a kind of spontaneity that is in tension with the planning and revision that perfectionists need.</p>
<p>Reading (browsing? surfing? floating in?) GAM3R 7H30RY, I felt a similar tension--between linear and nonlinear modes of reading.  In GAM3R 7H30RY, you read the text itself, on those digital index card-looking things, and then you have a choice about whether or not to read the comments.  Now, it seems that the comments are often the most interesting part of the text, so you really shouldn't skip them.  On the other hand, the importance of the comments doesn't seem to lessen the value of Wark's text, because without the original text, the comments wouldn't exist.  So although there certainly is some sensation of the linear, of accomplishing something, of moving progressively forward as you advance from card to card, this sensation is undercut by the "digression" (into the most important part of the text) that is required when we choose to read the comments.</p>

You might think 'Saudi blogger' is an oxymoron, given that Saudi Arabia is an incredibly restrictive place when it comes to communication and free speech.  But blogging has been growing incredibly rapidly in the Arabic-speaking world, just as it has in the Western world, during the past several years.  </p>
<p>Arabs use blogs for the same purposes as Westerners do: criticizing governmental policies, organizing protests, debating topics like religion, and simply sharing their personal stories.  What's particularly interesting about Saudi Arabian bloggers, though, is that equal numbers of women and men blog-- very surprising in one of the most conservative countries the world, in which women are prohibited from travelling without a male guardian or driving a car.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>At the end of class today we were wondering whether there are any sites outside of Shelley Jackson's main Skin site in which people with tattooed words could talk or connect with each other.  Well, I found <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart"> this</a>. (And, to be honest, is wasn't that hard to find, so maybe others have seen it.  It was linked on Wikipedia.)  The livejournal page--A Mortal Work of Art--allows the tattooed people to set up a community, and it's cool to see how friendly and excited they are to "meet", even if only on the web.  For example, look at <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart/146352.html">"Rocks"'s intro</a> and see the comments posted below of people saying hi.  (And check out the joke at the bottom: "On a somewhat twisted note, although it's against the rules to get a word tattooed on the body part it describes (when it's obvious it's a body part like knee or wrist) it would have been a hilarious placement choice to put "Rocks" on your testicles. LMAO. Painful... but amusing."  Sorry, I couldn't help but include that.)  I think it's amusing, by the way, how "Rocks" and many others comment on how slow a process it is to receive the text and notification from Jackson.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>It's been a bit since the heavy blog on blog discussion we had when we first started back in September. But our discussion on voyeurism and other events have made me think about the blog/reality issue again.<br />
I'm not sure how to clarify what I'm saying, but a couple of things have happened in the last week that made me feel uncomfortable with blogs.</p>
<p>The Tiny Cat Pants Tale- I read the aforementioned blog (it's linked on the right side of our own blog) regularly now because I enjoy Aunt B's sassy wit and frankness on personal stuff. So I knew she was coming to L.A. because she had been blogging about it. For a second, I thought "hmm, it would be cool to see her in person." But it was one of those throw-away thoughts, because why would she meet with someone who reads her blog, but she has no interaction with? How uncomfortable. THEN a post in Tiny Pants appears about Claremont, to which I thought "what a coincidence." This is followed by a Tiny Pants post about none other then KF who DID have dinner with her. Of course, this is followed with a post by KF about Aunt B. There was just too much reality interfering with my blogging experience. I felt mildly creepy, like I was listening in on two people's conversation without their knowing. Yes, the blogs are posted on the Internet and certainly not in a secretive way (you can get to both blogs through links from Writing Machines), but because I don't have my own engaging, intelligent blog, I feel like I have no business playing in their world.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So we've been working on two forms of electronic literature for this class: this blog and our wiki.  I'm wondering how people would compare the two experiences.  Is one harder or easier for you?  Do you enjoy one more than the other?  Any other random thoughts?</p>
<p>I find that I'm a lot less inhibited about adding to the wiki than I am about writing on this blog.  Maybe it's the fact that the wiki is a work in progress, or the fact that I don't have to slap my name on my wiki contributions.  I'm not entirely sure.  It's somewhat ironic, because I've never taken a creative writing class in my life.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Both of my English courses this semester have a significant blog component. This has thrown me for a loop. Where before I would while away the hours I'd set aside for reading course texts by surfing the internet, now that my homework happens to be surfing said internet, I find myself raiding my roommate's bookshelves arbitrarily. It's probably not a bad thing for me to be reading Sartre or DeLillo, but doing so is not going to help my grades any. Which I know deep down in my procrastinator's soul is a good reason for pursuing anything. </p>
<p>What I think may be another upside of my gpa-destroying behavior is that it indicates -- along with the sentiment of a great many of our blog posts, and the fact that most of us read our very first hypertext only last week -- that the novel as we know it isn't going anywhere. And not because the future tried to make its changes and failed, but because the printed novel and the hypertext happen to be separate media. Some of our trepidation about the e-lit age seems to be located in the idea that it will elbow out or somehow force change upon the things we cherish in more established literature. Were I not worried I'd sound like a dirty optimist, I'd confidently assert that the emergence of widespread electronic self-publication and the hypertext format will only strengthen the novel we know and love, in that it will help us triangulate what we find essential about the medium. TV and film co-exist, painting and drawing and photography as well, and the dynamics of each are unique enough to warrant their continued relevance. I have to think it's the same with text media. And having more data with which to determine what's important about different uses of the written word can only be a good thing, right?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Something that's been very weird to me--okay, whoa, magpie, just noticed the arched window watermark on the update page.  By moving the screen back &amp; forth, it either gets brighter than or darker than the rest of the screen.   Watermarks on media that would scream, shrivel, and die if actually in contact with water amuse me.  And it disappears if I get just the right angle...</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm used to lj, which, even if you're posting to a community and thus don't get to design the details of the journal yourself (The fact that this is not my personal aesthetic is making it somewhat uncomfortable to post here, it somehow doesn't feel like I can entirely post my thoughts, even though the clean, functional format of the class blog works very well with the sort of writing one is meant to put here), most everyone has a user icon (or several).  The lack of having some sort of visual aid to help me associate who's writing what is making it really hard for me to keep track of who's who.  Not just what username goes with what flesh-and-blood, I've mostly given up on that.  But who's writing which entries.  I suppose I really should just start reading each individual person's blog, so I have an idea of who's said what, where people stand and develop more of a sense of personality through writing style.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/articles/2006/060610_mfe_July_06_Klosterman.html">article</a> in Esquire, and it's from a while back but it got me thinking.  It's by Chuck Klosterman, so it's also a bit arrogant but, you know, that's how that goes.   Basically, he's asking why there are no video game critics and what the consquences of having no video game critics might be.  In my head I sort of started drawing some parallels, trying to ask myself what  purpose critics serve and if his same line of questioning could be applied to blogs.<br />
He opens the article by saying that there are still people who don't take video games seriously, and that these are the same people who think newspapers are still going to exist in a few decades.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've often wondered why it is that people of our generation seem to find Jon Stewart much funnier than people my parents age do.  It's not as though the concept of spoofing news is particularly new; SNL has been doing it for years.  I'm still trying to sort through the significance of this, but last night, as I was watching the Daily Show, I was struck by the similarities between the show's format and the format of a blog.  Instead of "link, commentary," the Daily Show offers us "video clip, commentary."  While SNL comics did something similar, they tended to stay in character.  Jon Stewart doesn't try very hard to maintain the persona of a newsperson.  His own voice and opinions come through very clearly.  In this way, he isn't so different from political bloggers.</p>
