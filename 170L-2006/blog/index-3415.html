    <div class="content"><p>In reading Ken Perlin's essay on finding an intermediate form between games and stories, I've started to wonder whether his pursuit of a middle ground is entirely possible and whether consumers would be satisfied with the results.  </p>
<p>He contrasts the non-agency of reading books or watching movies with the hyper-agency we experience when we play video games, calling for the creation of a suitable form that can properly combine both.  I think during this current stage of videogaming, Wright's response to Perlin's essay is a more relevant and realistic discussion, especially when he says he wants players to "play better stories."  That seems most important to me; I feel like that strategy stays true to the goal of games while also respecting player agency.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I came across this article <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/21989/index.html">"The Human Blog"</a> about Arianna Huffington.  It's a lot of promotional stuff and blah blah but it did make me think about the nature of the blog and the nature of the person who is participating in most of the technologies (and the communities that arise because of them) that we have today.  The article states, "Everywhere she goes turns into a series of links, links that lead to other links. She's a human blog."  At first this just seems like one of those tagline throwaway sentences, but then I started wondering how it might have some relevance. Further down in the article the author claims,  "her ability to shift swiftly from topic to topic, her swashbuckling political rhetoric, her penchant for attention-getting--are what the online world is all about."  It links the online world to the idea of popularity and "contagious ideas."  All this interconnectedness and sharing of information, and sharing information quickly and being blatantly honest and persuasive, well, it's working for her, right? Influential people use her blog as a place to put out their opinions, and she gets to orchestrate the whole thing.  The article seems to be suggesting that a certain kind of person will excel in the online world...does this mean that some people are better suited for the world of print?  I guess where I might go with that is, well, if Huffington is more successful in the world of blogs, and there are obviously other people who find the most success in the online world, how is their influence different from the influence of those who have success in print? Does someone like Huffington gain influence because her work is constantly on the computer screen and constantly changing, because her work can shift continuously?</p>

<p>    Night Owl and I were discussing the blog last Wednesday during class and we returned to our initial idea of a frame story.  I'm not sure to what extent we've achieved a frame story as of right now, but I think it might be a useful way of perpetuating the story on the first page (I'm not sure what the technical term is).  I was thinking it might be cool if we have a bit more of a setting for our story (ie. maybe we're all stuck in a room or building at school, or we're on some sort of trip in a vehicle).  That way, we might set a bit more of a tone for the stories, or at least for the characters who are telling our stories.  Also, we would have more of a meta-story to narrate throughout the telling of our other stories.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>At the end of her piece, "From Game-Story to Cyberdrama," Janet Murray calls for us to rethink how we approach the new genre she dubs "cyberdrama."  Instead of comparing the different aspects of the cyber-drama to the standards for either games or stories, she believes we ought to think about how we might make a better cyberdrama.  It occured to me that, if this is in fact possible, it may also be a good way to get out of the frustration that comes in our attempts to evaluate electronic literature and the recurring tendency to campare it with printed literature.  Of course, I think Murray may go a little too far in suggesting that we cannot accept any comparisons of a new genre with other genres it may have as its foundation.  In thinking about new forms of story-telling it may be wise to heed her word to evaluate and perpetuate them on their own merits yet it may also be that we can't help but compare them to their predecessors.</p>

What is the point of a piece if the only one who can understand it is the author?  If there's a way to interpret it, regardless of the original intent, then fine, but if the reader is so alienated by the text that they feel no connection and no willingness to interpret, then did the author do his job?  I guess it works in some cases - see Finnegan's Wake, which pissed me off to no end, but manages to be "Joyce's masterpiece."  Maybe I'm just not the type of person wh</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've been thinking a lot about Hayles's emphasis on the importance of the materiality of a piece of literature and McLuhan's insistance that "the medium is the message."  I wonder how these ideas apply to a "conventional" novel.  If materiality is so essential, then editors and illustrators are far more essential in the creation of a piece of literature than we give them credit for.  Is it then the case that every piece of "conventional" literature is a collaboration?  We could even extend this idea to a sort of collaboration with the reader.  I, for one, love to mark up books and write in margins when I read them, particularly for class.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/feature/poundstone03/Genius.html">bottle imps</a><br />
Cool and fun, slide your mouse over the buttons on the opening screen and make a song!<br />
But it's so much more then that. The piece uses bottle imps to think about electronic literature (bottle imps are explained on the site)<br />
The author, William Poundstone, makes some interesting observations about electronic literature in his FAQs. He writes, "eLit is fundamentally a medium of artifice- of symbols that are perceived as symbols." Is that true? Certainly for much of what we have read--but not stories like "Afternoon" or "Disappearing Rain." Those texts seem more strongly in the camp of literature that attempts to draw readers into something real. Perhaps I'm confusing my definitions. But certainly hypertexts are eLit --</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Just a little blurb about today's announcement of the Nobel Prize winner for Literature--it's a fellow whom I know very little about, called Orhan Pamuk.  I have a book on my shelf waiting to be read, and maybe this is the impetus to finally crack it open?  Anyway, it's a big brouhaha because the fellow has recently been in trouble for insulting "Turkishness", specifically accusing the Turks of massacring the Armenian population of  the Ottoman Empire during the WWII.  (His claim is a historical fact, by the way, albeit a convenient one that the modern-day Turks don't want to admit.) It's particularly bad luck that the prize was announced on the same day that the French passed a measure declaring it against the law to claim that the Armenian massacre was not a genocide.  Anyway you can read about it all <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2400727,00.html">in the London Times</a> for the political background or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/12/books/12cnd-nobel.html?hp&ex=1160712000&en=d60308682fde5845&ei=5094&partner=homepage">in the NYTimes</a> for some discussion of Pamuk himself, his political interests, and what he's written (and whether it's good!).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I think in the last 12 hours or so, my conception of hypertext has drastically changed from skepticism to new-found appreciation.  It all started when I was randomly looking through our course wiki, clicking on the various links and trying to figure out if there's a connecting or overarching theme behind the mess of links and witty mini-stories.  </p>
<p>Then, after sitting there for about half an hour, patiently going through pretty much all the links, I realized (kinda late, yeah I know) that the point of this collective narrative was to make those connections yourself and to connect the dots as we like.  That sounds like a rather obvious and "duh!" statement, but I honestly did not truly understand how that felt until I decided to try it out. Part of my initial frustration with our class wiki was the feeling of shooting blindly, not knowing even where to start.  It seemed to me like we were getting used to this new environment and playing around with inserting cute links rather than focusing on making a connected story with some semblance of coherence.  I realized last night, though, that the process of creating a collective hypertext really does need that initial random, blind stumbling in the beginning in order for it to go anywhere.  There needs to be a starting point, and somebody among the twenty-or-so of us needed to be that initiator.</p>

<p>Now there's a million cool (and naturally underdeveloped) ideas running around in this book.  One of them has to do with materiality, and McLuhan conjectures as follows: </p>
<p>"As our age translates itself back into the oral and auditory modes because of the electronic pressure of simultaneity, we become sharply aware of the uncritical acceptance of visual metaphors and models by many past centuries ... We become extremely conscious of cultural models and bias when moving from one dominant form of awareness to another, as between Greek and Latin or English and French.  So we are no longer amazed that the oriental world has no concept of 'substance' or of 'substantial form,' since they experience no visual pressure to break up experience into such packages [because their alphabet is symbolic rather than syllabic]."</p>
