    <div class="content"><p>Did you know you can talk to a Honnold/Mudd librarian online?  It was a funny concept to me, yet last Saturday I was eager to do it.  The most ironic part of me using this service from the library is that the reason I was using "librarianchat" was that I could avoid having to read online versions of articles and books.  That's right: I had found some sources for my final research paper for a class, but I felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown because the only versions I could find were online.  So I turned to talking to the librarian over AIM.  (Another funny addition to the story is that I'm usually on AIM all the time, but this semester I have been on it less and less, because it is such a huge distraction and I have been bombarded with work.)  Anyway, I signed online, talked to the librarian (who used all capital letters, which suddenly made me feel like I was a preteen and should be using them too), and figured out how I could get print editions.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>As I explored the social software links we were supposed to read, I first thought how funny it is to read definitions of other social software sites.  Does anyone else feel uneasy when they read definitions of AIM, Urban Dictionary, or even (and this is the weirdest of all) Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">definition</a> of Wikipedia?  I'm not sure I can pinpoint what gives me this uneasy feeling.  Maybe it's the concept of a site is defining itself (do print encyclopedias have entries on what encyclopedias are?).  Or maybe my uneasiness springs from a point that Lulu raised at the beginning of her post and that made me laugh because it's so true: what isn't social software these days?  Faceook, AIM, blogging...sometimes I feel like these are my life.  Social software seems like second nature to me and, in that sense, undefinable and unable to be analyzed.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I emailed one of the Skin participants.  I think I mentioned this in class Monday, but I was really curious why participants chose to become a part of the text.  I'm not saying it's completely ludicrous that anyone would want to be a part of Jackson's project (hey, I might do it), but I wondered whether participants just wanted a tattoo or actually wanted to embody Jackson's text, as she says the participants do.</p>
<p>I sent the email before I found the community blog for the Skin participants, so some of my questions are perhaps answered on that.  Nevertheless, I was excited to get such a quick response, so I wanted to share it with all of you.  I have to add, I was really worried the person would be annoyed that I wasn't a word but still emailed her.  I emailed the participant on the <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/footnotes.html">"footnotes"</a> page with the word "floating" because we talked about that post in class and because the participant said she was from California and Ohio, so I felt I could make somewhat of a connection to her.  I explained I was in a class that recently studied Skin.  Here is part of what I wrote: "My classmates and I were curious what you felt like after you got your word and, later, read the story. Â Was it thrilling to finally get your word and read the story, and was it ever a disappointment? Â Also, do you feel like you are an 'embodiment' of your word, as Jackson says you become?"</p>

    <div class="content"><p>At the end of class today we were wondering whether there are any sites outside of Shelley Jackson's main Skin site in which people with tattooed words could talk or connect with each other.  Well, I found <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart"> this</a>. (And, to be honest, is wasn't that hard to find, so maybe others have seen it.  It was linked on Wikipedia.)  The livejournal page--A Mortal Work of Art--allows the tattooed people to set up a community, and it's cool to see how friendly and excited they are to "meet", even if only on the web.  For example, look at <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart/146352.html">"Rocks"'s intro</a> and see the comments posted below of people saying hi.  (And check out the joke at the bottom: "On a somewhat twisted note, although it's against the rules to get a word tattooed on the body part it describes (when it's obvious it's a body part like knee or wrist) it would have been a hilarious placement choice to put "Rocks" on your testicles. LMAO. Painful... but amusing."  Sorry, I couldn't help but include that.)  I think it's amusing, by the way, how "Rocks" and many others comment on how slow a process it is to receive the text and notification from Jackson.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Apparently I am.  I looked at her <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/stain.html"> website</a> (which was linked as "IS" to her Skin project; check it out if you haven't yet) as well as some of her other projects.  I don't even know how to begin to describe this, so check out the <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/toy.html">"toy"</a> she created.  Another unusual, interesting project she has is <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/dollgames/index.html">"The Doll Games."</a>  As it says on the bottom of the first screen, it has to do with "doll sex, doll mutilation, transgender dolls, prosthetic doll penises, doll death, doll dreams."  She and her sister "began" it in 1970's when they played with and mutilated dolls. As Jackson says, "The Doll Games emerged in Berkeley, California at a time when race, gender, politics, and sexuality were fiercely and publicly debated. Indeed, as the dolls were taking their first steps toward literary history, the artists' family was opening a feminist bookstore just down the street from People's Park. The Doll Games' privately staged confrontations between androgynes and 'dainty ladies,' their outlaw utopias and anarchic child societies, and their uncompromising moral vision, cannot be understood without reference to the larger public discourse within which they took place."  Cool concept, I think.  You can look through journals they wrote for the dolls or look at pictures of transformed, reconfigured dolls.  (As a sidenote, I immeditaley clicked on "voyeurism" photo album because, as I posted earlier, I was trying to understand what that word means.  I thought the pictures made sense, because they are crotch shots of the dolls, but then I realized that the other albums contain similar photos.  Oh well.)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm curious and confused how to define Implementation.  Like <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/350">Lulu</a>, I don't necessarily think we need to pinpoint what Implementation is or isn't in order to read it, but its authors and Walker seem to beg readers to ask this question of it.  For instance, in the intro to Implementation, Rettberg and Montfort define the readers, depending on how they read or use Implementation, as either "sheet readers", "place readers", "web readers", or "participants".  For some reason I was annoyed when I read that only the people who post the stickers, photograph them, and send the photographs back to the authors are "participants."  This identification/definition makes sense, but initially I was mad that I couldn't be considered a participant just from reading the narrative.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Before I realized exactly what I'd be reading, I printed out the "letters"/pages from Implementation as if I'd be reading an article or a novel (which, actually, the authors claim it is).  Boy was I mistaken.  Some of the story lines were easy to follow, but often the dialogue completely switched topics from one paragraph to the next.  I had thought it was a bit ambitious for the authors to say  Implementation is a "novel about psychological warfare, American imperialism, sex, terror, identity, and the idea of place, a project."  After all, that's a lot of topics for a short novel.  But once I started reading, I saw that these sudden changes of topic and interweaving of stories allowed for so much ground to be covered.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I really enjoyed Jill Walker's discussion of feral hypertext in When Hypertext Literature Escapes Control.  Many of the topics/points she raises are ones we have talked about in class or on the blog.  For instance, I thought Steve Himmer's quote on page 2--"absence of a discrete, 'completed' product makes the weblog as a form resistant to the commodization either of itself, or of any one particular interpretation"--fit with the conversation Frabby raised in the <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/313">blog</a> entry on personal blogs gone wrong.  Another topic we talk about in class was raised by Walker on page 4, when she says that despite that readers feel like co-authors when reading hypertexts, they may actually have less control because they can't read the end of the story first like in conventional fiction.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I decided to investigate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennicam"> Jennicam</a>, the webcam girl who was mentioned briefly in class on Monday.  Wikipedia's information on her was interesting, but the information I stumbled upon that was linked that page was even more fascinating.  I clicked on another Wikipedia page entitled "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_whore"> Cam Whores</a>", which, according to Wikipedia, is "a term for people who expose themselves on the Internet with webcam software in exchange for goods, usually via enticing viewers to purchase items on their wishlists or add to their online accounts."  To learn more, I clicked on a link on that page to an article in The New York Times from December 2005 on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/national/19kids.ready.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=aea51b3919b2361a&ex=1292648400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"> Justin Berry</a>, a boy who at the age of 13 began using webcams in order to get more friends and ended up basically starting a pornography business.  For five years, he brought in tons of money from pedophiles.  There's a link on the left side to a 7-part interview series from the NY Times on him, and it is incredibly sad, moving, and fascinating.  His story, both about how he began his business and why he chose to end it by turning in himself and all his files to the FBI, made me think of our class for a few reasons, some more obvious than others.  First of all, I asked earlier about the word voyeurism, and this definitely seems like an example of it.  Secondly, when he talked about the pedophiles (who, creepily enough often ended up being people who work with children, such as teachers, pediatricians, and child lawyers), he mentions how he thought of them as "friends," though the friendship was completely constructed and often built on lies and an artificial web relationship.  Does this remind anyone else of Jemma?  Of course I'm not saying that Jemma played the role of either pedophile or pornographer, but it did ring a bell with me and made her forced friendship feel even more odd (and the promotion of her site to, say, teenagers as wrong).  Finally, Justin turned over the conversations he had with his "customers" that were logged on the computer, so, "Kind of Blue"-style, the FBI could (and is currently, I think) investigate them in a huge lawsuit.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I feel like I'm becoming an internet stalker.  When I was looking up information on "Kind of Blue's" author, Scott Rettberg, I saw that he received his PhD from the University of Cincinnati.  I'm from Cincinnati, and although I don't love my city, I get oddly excited when I hear others mention it, so I decided to pursue him.  I found a link to his <a href="http://retts.net/">blog</a>, and from there the stalking began.  There was a link below to a site called "Jill" and, lo and behold, it was <a href="http://jilltxt.net/">Jill Walker's</a>.  From looking at the sites, and his intrigued me in particular, you can read how they teach at the same university and about their adventures traveling to, say, a Turkish bath.  Or you can scroll through his photos, posted on Flickr.  That's right, you can see pictures of his dog, his vacations, his family on Christmas.  Or you can look through an album of 10 photos of Jill, which has the heading "This set is mostly for me. Sometimes I want to see my girl."  That didn't stop me from looking.</p>
