    <div class="content"><p>We talked in class today about the format of "Kind of Blue" and whether it can be reproduced in print form or whether the story relies on its email/internet form for meaning.  From what I gathered, some people believed its email style could be transferred to an epistolary print novel, especially since the fake in-box doesn't quite make sense in that all of the emails--no matter the recipient--are in the same in-box.  Others seemed to like the online style, and I agree.  I tried to think of what ways that this story might rely on its medium and form, and one thing that came to mind is its promiscuity.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Perhaps it's a bit unusual to write a blog with the purpose of asking a question about a definition, but I'm going to do it: What exactly is voyeurism?  What's crucial to understanding it?  I was confused in class when we talked about it, but I was too embarrassed to ask.  However, looking at even recent posts on the blog that use the term make me realize that I am still confused, and I'm not sure if my definition differs from others'.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism">voyeurism</a> is "a practice in which an individual derives sexual pleasure from observing other people."  Other definitions I've found seem a bit unclear on how sex is involved; is it necessary in voyeurism for the viewer to derive sexual pleasure, or can he/she just watch a sexual act?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>My reaction to Caroline and Jemma doesn't stand out from the rest of the class who has blogged on them: they weren't my favorite.  I'll admit, it was fun to hear British accents and relive some of the British abbreviations from my study abroad days, but the content of the both of the sites was less than interesting.  The intense sexual and/or alcohol themes of both simulations annoyed me and made me believe that these are designed for teenagers who want a peek at either uni life (however realistic it may be) or the life of a young working woman.  Emails from Jemma's coffee date reading "Fancy something stronger tonight?" and Caroline's drunkenness with Simon in her first video turned me off.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/washington/23fantasy.html?ex=1162267200&en=4e1a2bc1daa06c24&ei=5070&emc=eta1">article</a> from the New York Times again raises the question of the purpose of games.  It describes a new Fantasy Congress game (created by four CMC students!) that allows users to pick congressional teams (4 senators and 12 House members).  The creators wanted an alternative to the Fantasy Sports online teams/games that are incredibly popular.  I think this "game" ties into the discussions we've had in class and on the blog about the purpose of games and their use for educational purposes.  The final quote of the creator implies that Fantasy Congress can be a tool for popularizing politics: "Everyone knows about football, but more people need to know about Congress," Mr. Lee said. "If as many people knew about Congress as knew about football, baseball and basketball, we'd all be more educated."  I also feel Lee implies somewhat of a hierarchy of what being truly educated means, putting politics above sports.  I've never played Fantasy Sports and don't know how game-like these online fantasy teams are, but perhaps this game will make staying up-to-date on current events fun and get more people interested in politics.  In the end, though, I think people who are already interested in either sports or congress will be the ones playing.</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="../../node/265/index.html">Why aren&#039;t video game reviews more prevalent in the media?</a></h1>
      <span class="submitted">Submitted by Pimm on 23 October 2006 - 7:01pm.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li  class="first last taxonomy_term_90"><a href="../../taxonomy/term/90/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_90">video games</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I'm still intrigued by our discussion at the end of class today on the lack of video game reviews/coverage in certain newspapers or magazines.  During our discussion, I kept thinking the reason why there aren't as many video game reviews, even if the gaming industry is larger than the film industry, is a result of the demographics of who plays.  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cms/games/opening.html">This transcript</a> from a speech given by Doug Lowenstein (with an intro by Hnery Jenkins) at a conference hosted by MIT shows that I was wrong.  Granted, this speech was written in 2000, so I definitely need to update my statistics (which I'm having trouble doing), but it showed me that adolescent boys aren't the majority of the users.  For example, Lowenstein says of the most frequent users of video games console software, "We found that 65% were male, and 35% were female. 46% of the most frequent users of console games were under 18. 54% were over 18, and an astonishing one fourth was over 36 years old."  This made me even more confused why video games aren't more widely covered in the media.  Maybe, as someone in class pointed out today, true video game users spend so much time dedicated to play that they wouldn't be the ones writing the reviews.  And perhaps the people who control the more "respectable" newspapers/media have the same stereotype of video game users as I do (meaning, adolescent boys play, so those reviews don't need to be in, say, The New Yorker).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Playing with Zork was interesting, to say the least.  I could see the conflict Henry Jenkins describes in "Game Design as Narrative Architecture."  He writes, "Game designers struggle with this balancing act--trying to determine how much plot will create a compelling framework and how much freedom players can enjoy at a local level without totally derailing the larger narrative trajectory.  As inexperienced storytellers, they often fall back on rather mechanical exposition..." (126).  With Zork, I felt the larger narrative framework was derailed...or I couldn't find it.  Like Lulu, I googled (actually, I Wikipediaed) Zork, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  There is no way I could have figured out what I was doing and even get out the trees in the dimly lit forest until Wikipedia gave me simple commands to use.  Even after I found some help sites, I still couldn't figure out what to do.  The most frustrating part was that I felt like I was following strict guidelines that weren't even told to me on how to play the game.  I repeatedly typed in responses (which I thought made sense) that caused the message "I don't understand what you mean" to pop up.  After seeing those over and over, I wanted to scream at the computer.  Yet, oddly enough, the pleasure of typing something that caused a positive reaction or an actual response was rewarding enough to keep me going.  However, eventually the displeasure of seeing that my responses were invalid made me play the trick that KF said user did with Eliza: come up with ridiculous responses in order to mess up the system.  This turned out to be my favorite part, because I felt like I was getting a human answer.  For instance, I was stuck in the forest behind a grating, and I typed "pick up grating," to which Zork replied "You can't be serious."  When I found more grating and typed "jump grating" (again), I got "You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?"  Later, when I found the bird chirping in the tree, I (for kicks, I hope I'm not this violent in real life) typed "kill bird."  Zork responded: "I've known strange people, but attacking a bird?"  Funny stuff.  The amusing part is that enough users must have tried to input these same, weird commands or the creators of Zork suspected that there would be oddballs like me who wanted to push the game's buttons (so to speak) or they wouldn't have created those replies.  It made me want to continue just so I could see where I would get a funny reply and not simply "I don't understand what you mean."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm still fascinated with the debate over the purpose of video-games and, more importantly, the effects that people attribute to them.  Games can "teach" violence, knowledge of another historical period (Oregon Trail), math, etc--but, of course, their main purpose is to allow the user to have fun, or else they wouldn't be called games.  I really liked <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/229">Frabby's post</a> on the computer game conference at UC Irvine and the idea of whether computer games can teach ethics.  As I said earlier, I enjoyed playing the Sims because of the fantasy world I could create that still allowed me to "be" myself.  I thought that I would try the game KF mentioned in class--<a href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza/eliza.html">Eliza</a>--and see if I liked it for the same reason.  Did I? No!  I guess it's expected that Eliza can't do much, but I didn't even have fun trying to upset her.  Every time I answered "no", even to questions that almost required that answer, she asked me if I was being negative.  I think I need to see a real therapist after using her.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have a bit of a confession to make, although perhaps others will say that they did the same thing I'm about to admit.  I used to play the Sims a lot, and I got really into it.  I created worlds that resembled mine.  Actually, they were more fantasy worlds than my own surroundings, and that's where my confession comes in.  My friend I used to pick boys we liked and "create" them, and (I bet you can see where this is going) create ourselves, too.  It was great: it was like playing a grown-up version of house, complete with cooking dinner, getting a job, and making babies together.  Of course, it all seems a bit sophomoric now, but I definitely used it as an escape.  For this reason, I loved reading about the different author's analyses to the Sims in First Person.  Ken Perlin's article especially resonated with me.  I liked the Sims because I became a sort of author, yet that "willing suspense of belief" (17) that the characters were real never came to me.  Granted, I did get extremely caught up in the people I "created" in hopes that their actions (which I, of course, controlled) would come true.  This ties into thisismycheese's discussion of the different types of immersion.  The Sims made me feel mid-way between the two types of immersion thisismychesse describes: I felt like I was in the game, as a character, yet I never truly felt like I was really there.  And I certainly never felt the same emotional immersion I feel when I read novels.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>At the end of class today we discussed whether or not the form of Hayles's book somewhat refutes her own claims because it basically forces certain mediums--like the imitations of internet links--into her text.  It made me think of a book I read for my African American science fiction (or Afrofuturisms) class that I actually mentioned in my last post.  The book, <a href="http://www.rhythmscience.com/">Rhythm Science</a> by musician, turntablist, producer and writer Paul D Miller, aka Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid, has the image of a record on the front and a hole through the center of the record and the enter book.  The hole actually serves as purpose, because it holds a CD that's included at the back of the book.  As you might be able to tell from the link, the book has an odd array of images, colors, lines, and words scattered throughout.  (Including a repeating image of the playboy bunny; Professor Thomas said she couldn't figure why he included that--) It wasn't a big surprise for me to learn that the book, like Writing Machines, was published by MIT Press.  It even has an online version (<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/mediawork/#">"WebTake"</a>), and the link to it is right above the link to Writing Machines.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Because I read Hayles's description and explanation of "Lexia to Perplexia" before I actually looked at Memmot's work, I was surprised how much it overwhelmed me and gave me a headache.  I couldn't click a back button, so I was often trapped in loops.  Once I clicked on Memmot's name, for instance, and kept seeing Egyptian symbols and circles.  I clicked around but couldn't find an exit, so I became frustrated and quit.  Then I reentered the site, began reading the "Minifestos" (which I actually liked because of the scroll-over definitions of words), but then accidentally clicked on a link that forced me to exit the site.  I should have believed Hayles when she said "Lexia" is "a very 'nervous' document" (57).  I felt almost completely out of control, and the bright, flashing lines and messages (which I initially thought were cool) frustrated me when I couldn't read the text or make sense of what I read.</p>
