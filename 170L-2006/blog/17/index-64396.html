    <div class="content"><p>Let me begin by saying what a relief it was to read "Writing Machines."  I had read a bit of Hayles for an AfroFuturisms class I took with Professor Val Thomas on African American Science Fiction.  For that class, I grappled with Hayles's definition of posthumanism, something I think I'll never fully understand because it is too abstract and theorized for my brain to process.  "Writing Machines" was much easier to understand.  Sure, as silversprung pointed out, there are passages that I didn't comprehend, but I think the way in which the book was written really helped my understanding.  Unlike thisismycheese, I enjoyed the design.  True, I didn't always understand why the magnified portions were magnified, but they didn't hurt of reading, and I liked the break in monotony.  Also, one of my favorite parts was the portions of autobiography.  I still don't completely understand if "Kaye's" life and thoughts differ at all from Katherine's.  (As Katherine says on page 10, Kaye shares autobiographical elements from her life, but they are not the same person.  But Hayles also says in her acknowledgements that "inventing a persona" allowed her to "work through the barriers I had thrown up around the idea of autobiography so I could finally see it" (142), so I assume that Kaye is Kate, just transformed into words on a page).  It is through these stories that I came to an understanding, with Kaye, that hypertext is not necessarily on a electronic text, and that "books are more than encoded voices; they are physical artifacts whose material properties offer potent resources for creating meaning" (107). Kaye's stories and other ones that Hayles's inserts, such as Danielewski's relationship and story to his father, made the book much more enjoyable.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After reading some posts, like Lulu's on the Tamagotchi and Shock and Awe's on interactive fiction, and looking at the <a href="http://nytimes.com/">New York Times website</a>, I'm curious how far this desire for electronic interaction with books, toys, news, etc will go.  It seems weird to me that Michael Joyce's "Afternoon" can only be played in Classic on Macs and that, as we talked about in class last week, if Classic were no longer possible to use, his text would become extinct.  Of course, from the examples of the Tamagotchi or the interactive fiction, his ideas didn't fade and morphed into different things.  When I mentioned earlier that I looked at the New York Times page, I noticed one headline in particular--"Student Killed in Amish Schoolhouse"--that includes a video with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/us/03amishcnd.html?hp&ex=1159848000&en=daac5f1bbbfdd36a&ei=5094&partner=homepage">article</a>.  I always thought that online news sites provided video for articles that they thought people wouldn't read, but clearly this isn't true anymore (for instance, the article I mentioned is about such a awful, gruesome topic that I feel people will be drawn to the words in order to learn more).  So what creates this desire to have electronic interaction?  Why do people want more than simply to read words?  By the way, I don't mean to imply that I think only hard, non-electronic news, toys, and books are better than interactive material.  I love photographs and video that accompany news stories, and I'm a sucker for interactive, electronic toys.  I'm just curious where the line will be drawn on this interaction, and, on a somewhat different note, why more hasn't been done to preserve the forerunners of hypertextuality, like the "Afternoon."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm still bothered by and intrigued with one of Joyce's points in "Othermindedness."  He says of Vassar students studying hypertexts, "They each expected a reader reading for herself, a reader much less concerned with knowing than knowing about.  Teaching and writing in the middle voice calls us to the realization that we have always been less geared toward knowing than knowing about" (65).  He gives the example of poet who asks his students to "name ten master-pieces of literature that you haven't read and know you will never read that nonetheless influence your life as a poet" (66).</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>This is what Landow says is possible with a hypertext, and it's hard to disagree with him after trying to read one.  But are hypertexts and multiple paths a good thing?  Marmalade began a discussion on how hypertexts "decenter" the author, and I think this is a fascinating topic to pursue.  As Landow says, hypertexts are "infinitely recenterable" (36) and create "truly active" readers because of their interaction with the text, but in what ways does a hypertext take away the readers' ability to interpret on their own (through providing links to certain explanations, etc.)?  And, flipping the coin, hypertexts also seem to give up some of the writers' authority to the reader.  It all seems like an odd mixing of losing and gaining control.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>It's amazing how strong--and similar--many of the responses to Joyce's "Afternoon" have been. Like shock and awe and many others from our class have mentioned, I was frustrated with the format of "Afternoon."  However, the hypertext was also incredibly intriguing, and it was definitely worth "reading" in order to get first-hand experience with hypertexts.</p>
<p>At first I went through "Afternoon" the same way I used to read the "choose-your-own-adventure" books that I read when I was little (and that Joyce references in his article, as well as Lulu on the blog).  I soon realized how different the two are.  You can't completely reread, as I used to do with adventure books when I chose a certain path for the heroine but was immediately disappointed with my decision and eager to see option B.  I found that with "Afternoon," every time I chose "yes" then clicked back and chose "no", I ended up with the same piece of story on the next screen. I assume that I hadn't reached a part where I had the power to make the decision "yes" or "no" that actually mattered, but it was still interesting to see how active I actually could be as reader and semi-writer (which is, as both Joyce and Landow seem to say, one of the main purposes of the text).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Bush's article begins with a list of reasons why science and technology is beneficial.  It's funny to me yet completely understandable that sometimes we have to remind ourselves why new technology and scientific research is important.  I think one of the main reasons we need these reminders is because of the fear of new technology.  As Burnett says, "Machines attract and repel humans" (123).  One of these fears relates to our McLuhan discussion, and that is the disappearance of technology from our consciousness through immediacy.  Burnet asks: "What happens, however, when machines disappear from 'view' into the background and nevertheless retain their importance?" (123).  As Burnett says, machines now function with extreme importance in our society, yet they are so important that they pose a danger that the "assumption, if not the reality, that humans no longer control their own destiny" (123).  On one hand, we hope that computers can do more than just what people program them to do, yet there is also great danger in their "intelligence."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I went on a trip, sponsored by the Career Development Office, to visit the LA Times today.  Four other students and I toured their printing presses and main offices as well as spoke to a few journalists who work there. I write about this trip because two of the people who took us on the tour, a Pomona alum and a tour guide for the Times, seemed sensitive and disapproving of online journalism when students brought it up.  Their reaction is justified in one sense, because, as they told us, they don't know how to get money from the online editions.  Should they charge for any access to their newspaper site?  Should they charge for access to back issues of the paper, like the New York Times does?  Or should they just let their website open to the public?  As they said, even if they restrict access, it's often easy to get old articles by searching certain words or authors through Google.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We already touched on my group's passage in class, but I think I would be good to post a few more notes about it since it relates to the threat and danger of electric technology.  The passage begins on page 17 of the McLuhan, midway through the bottom paragraph with the words "The American stake", then continues through the following paragraph until "The serious artist is the only person able to encounter technology with impunity, just because he is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception."  In the beginning of our passage, McLuhan emphasizes the danger electric technology poses to all aspects of American society, and he says that perhaps one of the reasons it is so dangerous is that humans are unaware of the danger it poses (it is "quite invisible", "quite unrecognizable" to us).  Precisely because the content of this new electric technology is the same as the content in other medium, we are unaware of the effect this new medium has on us.  He writes, "For the 'content' of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind" (18).  In other words, though we are focused on the content, the effect of the form/medium in which the content is sent is extremely important.</p>
