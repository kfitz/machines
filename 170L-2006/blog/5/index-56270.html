    <div class="content"><p>I just read Frabby and Zoey's posts and their concerns remind me of my own.  The whole final project process, for me, has been an expedition into the unknown.  Certainly, Dreamweaver has presented a lovely set of concerns.  For awhile, I really couldn't figure out how to double space my text.  The frustrating part was that I knew I should be working on content, but I kept finding myself obsessing over the little formatting technicalities.  For those of you who are working, or have worked, with Dreamweaver, you know that you can make a split screen where the top half shows the computer programming language and the bottom half is your actual workspace.  I find it strange that, in the process of creating each page on Dreamweaver, you are generating a text that, a lot of the time, especially for amateurs, you don't understand.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I must begin by saying that I'm not sure I completely understand some of Joyce's ideas in "Walking Mornings," I was both confused and fascinated by his meditation.  He gestures toward the confusion of his students and colleagues concerning his literal retreat from technology and electronic writing.  Yet, as is often the case, I can understand why he needed to remove himself from that on which he needed to reflect.  At any rate, I was at first troubled by how much he focused on his personal journey instead of concerns about the Internet.</p>
<p>It seems like he sees the Internet both as a space of possibility and also a place of chaotic, and often useless, repetition.  He says: "covering the same ground again and again is human nature and the denial of its value...is nothing less than the denial of mortality, of the value of passing and of passing value...thus the monstrous claim for nextness...can be seen as a sin against nature."  It seems, from reading Joyce, that we ought to take a breath and review the current state of affairs before running around in circles some more or demanding new material we don't know what to do with.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I took a look at "The Onyx Project" and, after reading about it and watching the two clips, I was a little mystified.  Apparently this new, non-linear form is a new innovation.  On the site, they claim: "NAVworldsâ„¢ are nonlinear in form. Their form does not have a beginning, a middle or an end. Nor are NAVworldsâ„¢ "choose your own adventure" movies. Nor are they "choose our own ending" movies. They are not "interactive movies." Not browseable movies. Not movies."  I'm wondering if anyone has seen the project in its entirety. It says on the site that there is a secret not revealed until the end, yet, in other places, it says that the user can decide which links to press and no two users will have the same experience.  Thus, it seems both that there is an end and that there should not be an end (since there is supposedly not a beginning, middle and an end). Can anyone clarify?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I read Wark's "Agony" entry and I'm not sure what to think about the attempted parallel with Plato.  In Wark's chapter, he wants us to think about getting beyond the dark game room, where there is nothing but playing the games.  I think that a comment posted by Michael Hardt shows some of my concern.  It is difficult to insert a chunk of Plato into a piece that also talks about a "map of the 'hood.'"  It takes some skill, at any rate, and perhaps a more impeccable translation.</p>
<p>Some of the comments on this section also portray frustration that Wark seems to say that gamers are "loners apart from the reality of life."  I've been reading some critical literature lately that wants to oppose this sort of view by showing that participation in games can be closely tied to "real life."  Even by playing games with our friends, we retain some of the "real life" aspect.  Also, perhaps some of the games represent many of the serious issues we face in the real world.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Over the semester, we have discussed how writing differs according to the forum in which it is done.  For example, recent posts have discussed how hypertexts offer disjointed, non-linear readings.  Recently, I talked to a class member about the casual nature of blogs and the difficulty in making them conform to a structured, more formal style (for, say, the final critical project, if that's what you're doing).</p>
<p>I'm working on a critical project that is a hypertext and I'm definitely finding that the form is guiding the style and even content of my paper.  I don't know how others are going about their final critical project (if they're doing one), but I started out thinking that I could pretty much write the 15-20 page paper and then worry about forcing it into an online structure that</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>My final project is about online identity construction, fragmentation and multiplicity.  As I've been thinking about the different perspectives on these issues, I've had a hard time reconciling the fact that we can, in certain online settings, create a character that doesn't have much to do with ourselves.  Yet, I reject the view that the online space is a vacuum, uninformed by the real world and the "real" person creating identity online.</p>
<p>I came across a passage in "Life on the Screen" by Sherry Turkle.  In it, she is discussing Gordon who dropped out of school after his fresman year in college to pursue a career in computer programming.  Gordon apparently also spends a lot of time on MUDs (multi-user dungeons) playing and creating different characters.  In her discussions with Gordon, he mentions how certain characters are like himself or not like himself, yet he is always talking about them in relation to his own identity.  In a bizarre twist, Gordon found his fiancee on a MUD.  The relationship began when one of his characters began a relationship with one of her characters.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm reading a collection of essays right now called "Communities in Cyberspace" and in it is an essay by Judith Donath called "Identity and Deception in the Virtual Community."  In it she addresses one of the issues we discussed in class.  We wondered why people would choose to contribute to a wiki and we came up with a few possibilities.  Donath suggests that some people say altruism accounts for some contributions but she believes it is more likely that people want to assert themselves as knowledgable sources.  She says that "building reputation and establishing one's online identity provides a great deal of motivation" because no matter how intelligent your post is, you can only get recognition if the author is known.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Today in class we talked about the future of the book.  In particular, I was surprised that Bolter was so free in uploading "Writing Space" on the internet and allowing anyone to edit is as they please.  They say once you write a book and publish it for the world, it's not really yours anymore.  I guess Bolter is just really taking it to the next level.  At any rate, I was wondering, outside of the community of scholars particularly interested in this subject, who else legitimate would put a book online for free?</p>
<p>I found my answer on a site called www.edge.org on which Jaron Lanier writes an article called <a href="http://http/www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html">"Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism"</a>.  Yochai Benkler, who is a law professor at Yale, has published a book called "The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom."  He then posted it as a free download online and people (Lanier says between 15,000 and 20,000) downloaded it and added comments and links.  I checked it out and, sure enough, within seconds I had all 527 pages on computer.  Benkler said it's an experiment and presentation of what he sees as the future of the book.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have been reading the Many to Many site and I was interested by a couple posts that are thinking about identifying exactly who is doing what on these social sites.  The first post, by Danah Boyd is about comScore's alleged misinterpretation of data about MySpace.  Apparently comScore's statistics show that many people over 34 are using MySpace. Boyd first points out that there is a difference between people who visit the site and people who actually use it (have accounts).  Second, Boyd poses the question of how we can say who is actually making and using the accounts.  As she points out, the statistics show that there are more 100+ people using MySpace than are even alive.  Also, people post that they are one age and then their picture looks much, much younger.  She says that many teenagers are using their parents computers which may cause statistics about user age to be artificially high.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have seen Sherry Turkle sited in many, many texts I've read and so I decided to see what all the fuss is about.  I began leafing through her novel, "Life on the Screen," and I came across an interesting section on identity on the Internet called "Aspects of the Self."  In it, she puts forth a few different psychoanalytic theories (from Freud, Jung, and Lacan) and speaks about their relevance to online identity.  She begins by stating how Freud proposed a decentered view of the self (ego, id, etc) and then how Lacan moved forward with this idea to "join psychoanalysis to the postmodern attempt to potray the self as a relam of discourse rather than as a real thing or a permanent structure of mind." For Lacan, "the complex chains of associations that constitute meaning for each individual lead to no final endpoint or core self."  Turkle believes that online phenomena (for example, online dating) represents this cycling through of different dimensions or lines of self.</p>
