With all this talk about how Wikipedia can be a helpful research tool and an innovative way to incorporate lots of different authors, Urban Dictionary seems like its bastard cousin. Though it claims to be a dictionary of common slang (and it definitely has that), the site has also turned into a warehouse for high schoolers (and younger kids) to post entries about their specific high schools, or even trash specific people (which is really pretty awful).</p>

<p>But, anyways, I found a <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2004/12/the_film_as_book.html"> post</a> called, "the film as book," about the movie Tarnation, which is a super low-budget film about the filmmaker's relationship with his mother. The interesting thing about this film is that it is composed of actual videos, answering machine messages, and pictures from the director's life.  The blog post was mostly concerned with how film was merging with books and the way the movie seems to be composed of "writing."</p>

I remember that we already discussed facebook a little at the beginning of the semester (in light of the news feed debacle), but I think that the many 2 many blog offers some meatier stuff to think about here. There was kind of a lengthy <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/09/17/facebooks_privacy_triumph_stealth_secrecy_and_melodrama.php ">debate</a>going on, and people had some intense reactions (which is sort of amusing because I get the feeling that these adults aren't even on facebook).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I know that we're going to be looking at networked writing next week, and this website falls under that, but I'm going to jump the gun and talk about it anyways--because I am kind of disconcerted about my experience with <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a></p>
<p>I feel like somebody talked about a similar website earlier, where you could look at other people's catalogued favorite music/books/movie, but I can't find the post, so sorry if this is a bit repetitive.</p>
<p>But to my point: I spent a bit of time with LibraryThing today, and the whole thing has left me feeling very very not special. Every time I type in a favorite book, lists of my other favorite books come up tagged as well. It's almost eerie. Evidently there are thousands of people who have read the exact same things as me and then had similar reactions. I think what you read, what you really enjoy, reflects on you as a person. So I'd like to think that I'm a little bit original, a little bit quirky. Of course, the Internet begs to differ.</p>

I was pretty interested in her autobiographical (with lies, as she writes) hypertext <a href="http://www.altx.com/thebody/ ">"My Body."</a> Jackson has drawn a picture of herself (a pretty good approximation, I have to say) and each body part is linked to a story or thought. Within these body parts are links to further stories. </p>
<p>It's pretty clear now that Jackson is really, really super interested in bodies along with words. But I wouldn't say that this is a love letter to her body, there's something a little unsettling going on here that I can't explain at this point. Perhaps I should look more carefully; I've only spent a little time reading through.</p>

<p>"Although these sites are public, and their authors are well-aware that their words are read by many, my pinpointing connections and analyzing relationships by the words in which they are told seems to cross a boundary that should not be crossed"</p>
<p>Walker finds this sort of examination "ethically problematic." Does she mean it would be unethical to map out all the personal relationships and intricacies and then write about it? That may be unethical (maybe) but it also wouldn't be very interesting in an academic arena, so it's kind of a moot point. If Walker means it's unethical to do so out of curiosity, then I think I disagree. If you're invested in someone's blog, particularly the blog of someone you've never met, why wouldn't you want to read their friends' blogs? Why wouldn't you want to read about different perspectives on your blogger? Different stories?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I got a lot out of Walker's "Distributed Narratives." She brought up a lot of interesting stuff (though didn't seem to give herself enough space to discuss them all). I particularly liked the sticker art discussion. To me, it seems like the older, pre-Internet project Truisms by Jenny Holzer was more--hard-core. That's not a very good word for it, but in the age of the web, things like Implementation don't have much mystery to them, because the segments are all posted online. </p>
<p>Walker writes, "the implicit links of the distributed narrative are instead invitations that encourage the audience to go and find more" (10). With Implementation, the finding it pretty minimal, it's all right there. There was something more interesting and secret-club-esque about Holzer's pieces scattered all over Manhattan. Of course, the nature of these projects are different in that Holzer was a one-woman show while Implementation incorporated lots of different people who were given freedom to place the stickers where they wanted. But still. If you found a string of stickers out of nowhere, and didn't have the power to Google it, then I think you'd feel pretty cool.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>It's been a bit since the heavy blog on blog discussion we had when we first started back in September. But our discussion on voyeurism and other events have made me think about the blog/reality issue again.<br />
I'm not sure how to clarify what I'm saying, but a couple of things have happened in the last week that made me feel uncomfortable with blogs.</p>
<p>The Tiny Cat Pants Tale- I read the aforementioned blog (it's linked on the right side of our own blog) regularly now because I enjoy Aunt B's sassy wit and frankness on personal stuff. So I knew she was coming to L.A. because she had been blogging about it. For a second, I thought "hmm, it would be cool to see her in person." But it was one of those throw-away thoughts, because why would she meet with someone who reads her blog, but she has no interaction with? How uncomfortable. THEN a post in Tiny Pants appears about Claremont, to which I thought "what a coincidence." This is followed by a Tiny Pants post about none other then KF who DID have dinner with her. Of course, this is followed with a post by KF about Aunt B. There was just too much reality interfering with my blogging experience. I felt mildly creepy, like I was listening in on two people's conversation without their knowing. Yes, the blogs are posted on the Internet and certainly not in a secretive way (you can get to both blogs through links from Writing Machines), but because I don't have my own engaging, intelligent blog, I feel like I have no business playing in their world.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Back again on the well-blogged about problem of narrative versus game versus hybrid, I wonder if it's just too soon to force names on emerging media forms. I'm reading a book called Factual Fictions by Lennard Davis on the origins of the English novel. He discusses (not surprisingly) the birth (or maybe form) of the novel in the 17th-18th century arena, focusing on the blurriness between fact and fiction in these works. That alone isn't too relevant to our class blog, but in it he writes about defining the novel and trying to locate its birth. Davis says, "The first and preeminent notion in any methodology of beginnings is that of the threshold. That is, at what historical moment does narrative, for example, becomes what we can call novelistic?"</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In discussion groups today, silversprung asked who ended up winning the great game debate: games as games or games as stories?<br />
We didn't answer the question perhaps because it required too much thinking for the beginning of class. But I'm still thinking about (well sort of) because it's evidently a sore spot for people even outside of the academic world.<br />
One of my friends is pretty into gaming (from a non-academic standpoint), and when I told him about the tensions over narrative in games, he immediately insisted that most good games are serious stories. Obviously, by intimating that games were not stories, I was somehow threatening their value, and belittling people who play them. But insisting that games are stories doesn't really help ludology become its own distinct thing if it so wrapped up in other fields.</p>
