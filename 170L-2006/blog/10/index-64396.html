    <div class="content"><p>I enjoyed the short essay, "Walking Mornings," because it was written in what I can only describe as a lovely style, and it solidly connected a man's experience in the physical world with his experiences in the technological one. But mostly I felt, if not sad (that word is a little too extreme), then at least lukewarm after reading this piece. Joyce centers his essay on walking as "a trope for possibility," though "empty possibility," is given just as much attention. Joyce is lauded as "granddaddy of hypertext fiction" in the short author biography, and even he is lost in front of this possibility.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have read both Infinite Jest and Gravity's Rainbow (though "read" is a bit of a stretch for what happened with Gravity's Rainbow, I'd say it was more like a desperate run to the finish). And I'm definitely not arguing that these books have some neat conclusions. However, when I read Infinite Jest, I feel like I'm not getting something due to my own idiocy. I feel like all the clues are there, and I just can't figure it out because I'm not well-versed enough in philosophy, literature, and history. BUT if I try hard enough, and keep on reading it, I'll figure it out. Now, I guess this isn't true, Infinite Jest won't ever resolve itself, no matter how smart you are. But that was still the emotional reaction I had reading it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I share some of the feelings and concerns that gunslinger and marmalade have voiced. Not only am I very attached to the act of physically reading a book (I can't stand reading things online, I always print them out), but I like answers. And the types of fiction that Joyce discusses provide very few answers, as Marmalade points out. Yet before we can start jumping up and down angrily, he hits us with, "What we see as senseless beauty may be the emergence of as yet unrecognizable new ways of making sense" (63). So we just don't get it right now? I can buy that, I'm sure if I were born in a different era, I would be preaching orality with everyone else (though I'm still impatient for my own understanding of literacy to expand). But it still seems like a bit of a cop-out: it's too amazing, it transcends us, and we can't grasp it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was trying to enjoy something a little less academic when I came across an article that seemed like a dumbed down version of some of the theory we've been reading. I admit it; I was reading Marie Claire, a fashion magazine that isn't even that good in the scheme of fashion magazines. But in between the Sarah Jessica Parker interview and fall's fashion preview (it's all about tweed) there was an article about the effect of technology on young women's lives. Marie Claire asked two women to participate in an "experiment." One woman stopped using technology (the magazine threw this term around loosely, the woman didn't start living like the Amish, she just didn't use email, instant messenger, and stuff like that) and the other woman had to rely entirely on the Internet (she even had to order food online).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In light of the last two posts (Marmalade's comment that perhaps there is something more out there then blogs and Lulu's comment about "trash culture") I'm not sure how welcome this post will be. But I guess I didn't care too much because I posted it anyways. So another comment on trash and blogs: some minor celebrities have started protesting their constant appearance on popular entertainment blogs. What mainly comes to mind is the Fergie (of Black Eyed Peas fame) debacle. Her new song, "Pedestal," attacks bloggers like Perez Hilton for saying mean things about her and then hiding "behind computer screens." I thought this was pretty amusing because it certainly paints blogging in a different light then that hot song "We Didn't Start the Weblogs" and because, well, it's just funny.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This blog post from one of the "interesting academic blogs" <a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/2006/09/television_goes_multiplatform.html#more">THE POST</a> on our class site is making me think about how the medium of television is changing. Jenkins writes about the relationship between Apple and ABC which has allowed people to download episodes of Grey's Anatomy (among other shows) onto their ipods, and the general shift that networks are making toward supporting their shows in a legal online format.<br />
I love television, A LOT, and I have been considering buying one of those new ipods that play TV shows wherever you go. I've hesitated (and not only because I don't have enough money) because I'm not sure it's a good idea to give me that kind of power. I'm not sure if I have the self-control not to watch TV every time that I sit down somewhere. On one hand it's a dream come true but I don't think it would help me build a sparkling personality.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I found the Burnett piece kind of odd as he seemed to be asking lots of questions, and then skipping onto another idea-- where he found more questions to ask. Yet, very little was resolved. But here were a couple of things that I found interesting/alarming:</p>
<p>"In the life sciences and many disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, images are still talked about as if they had specifiable effects. The most limiting example of this is the powerful trope of images as purveyors of violence and transparent vistas onto the events of the world" (xvii). I understand Burnett's point here: allowing images to be only records of actual events, frozen in time, and beholden to the past and present certainly doesn't match up with how he discusses images (or how he defines them in the following page). But this point also reminded me of the way that politicians and interest groups use the "power" of images to advance agendas about how the media should be controlled. I'm talking about the shit-show that followed the Columbine shootings and concerns that music and violent images incite violence in teens. This made me think about different ways that images can be viewed (or even thinking back to McLuhan where the medium is the message) and how that will have repercussions for the way that traditional (and untraditional) images are controlled. The sort of stuff that Burnett discusses (particularly the growing autonomy of machines and the blurry lines between biology and machines) is kind of scary and I can see future parties or political organizations trying to limit the creation of, or access to these sorts of hybrids in an attempt to protect impressionable groups.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This is in response to the previous post about hot and cold, but I'm writing it as a new entry because I'm under the impression we are supposed to do that if our comments will be particularly long and cover slightly different ideas. Correct me if I'm wrong!<br />
Anyways, Silversprung and I discussed the passage on page 27 of McLuhan to get a better handle on the differences between hot and cold. Everything that follows is half Silversprung's as she and I worked together. The passage starts with "In terms of the theme of media hot and cold, backward countries are cool, and we are hot. The 'city slicker' is hot, and the rustic is cool."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Ong's discussion about the progression of writing talks about the contribution of the Greeks who developed the first alphabet containing vowels. The importance of this was that "the Greek alphabet was democratizing in the sense that it was easy for everyone to learn" (89). Yeah, this isn't a particularly complex point in comparison to everything else we read, nor is it even that integral to the rest of the Ong piece. However, the word "democratizing" caught my eye and made me think about a paper I wrote for another class about the rise of political blogs that rabidly advocated for their particular political party.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I suppose that this will be of little interest to academically minded students. But a lot of the stuff that I read online is gossip in some form or another, particularly celebrity gossip. I use <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt" />Oh No They Didn't</a> as my primary source for straight information. It's a community live journal that's constantly updated by random contributors. I assume the posts are monitored for accuracy and general offensiveness by a group of moderators, but I haven't figured out exactly who runs it.<br />
However, the more interesting blogs are those that take small bits of gossip and present them in a sassy manner. Among my favorites is <a href="http://www.wwtdd.com/">What Would Tyler Durden Do?</a>. It's written by a random guy who doesn't seem to have much connection to actual celebrities. But his lack of exposure is made up for with his in-your-face, super politically incorrect style of writing. Finally the site <a href="http://perezhilton.com" />Perez Hilton</a> is also kind of cool because he has become a minor celebrity in his own right due to his internet gossiping. He posts pictures of himself with B-List celebrities like Paris Hilton (note the name of the site) and somehow manages to hobnob with celebrities and trash them on his site.</p>
