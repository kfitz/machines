    <div class="content"><p>I'm pretty interested in incidences when the theory we read about becomes pertinent to "real life." I'm sure a lot of people saw the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/education/20online.html?pagewanted=2&ei=5087&em&en=aef49754dc892bec&ex=1161662400 ">article </a> on the front page of the New York Times on Friday about the growing number of high school AP courses that use virtual experiments (like dissections) in lieu of physical labs. The College Board took a pretty hard line against virtual experiments, claiming that it just didn't match up to the real thing. After online schools threw a fit, the Board has softened a little bit and agreed to look into these virtual classrooms. Complicating things further is that many students are drawn to online classes because their own schools lack the resources to offer AP classes. As someone who took AP classes (all non-science) online because my own high school didn't offer them, I sympathize with kids who want these online science classes. However, a picture of a dissection, even if you can manipulate the images, doesn't seem to compare to the real thing. Then again, does it really matter? Certainly the high schoolers taking all these optional AP classes will have a chance to conduct experiments in college.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>What a cool little article from Gonzalo Frasca! After the Moulthrop piece in the last section, I can't say I'm shocked by the socially conscious way that some academics are approaching video games, but I'm still surprised. Claiming that videogames could deal with social issues in a productive way is a bold statement (and maybe a bit ridiculous?...) but pretty interesting. I was particularly provoked by Augusto Boal's work with the "Theater of the Oppressed." I'm pretty sure I wouldn't actually want to attend a performance where the point "is not to produce beautiful or enjoyable performances, but promote critical discussions among the participants" (89). Then again my miniscule attention span prevents me from attending theater in general. Also, don't good plays provoke critical discussion anyways? Perhaps theater-goers should be forced to stay after plays and break into small discussion groups. Or--perhaps not. Still, it sounds like this man's work is intense.</p>

Looking through the topics, one title really caught my eye, "Teaching Ethics: Can Video and Computer Games Evoke the Empathetic Involvement that Fosters the Altruistic Perspective?" The authors (two women) are looking into the possibility of creating a game that provokes empathetic feelings (which in turn becomes actions) in players. A possible scenario for such a game would be where a player is a rescue worker in a war.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Of all the essays we read in this collection, I enjoyed Moulthrop's the most. The ludology section wasn't exactly a page-turner for me, but then Moulthrop really kicked things up a notch when he took gaming (and everything that goes along with it) out of the academic world and framed it in terms of current events. Moulthrop begins and ends with a discussion of terrorism and the international political climate we inhabit. He writes, "the subject of play is inherently troublesome--Yet games and play demand serious attention even in such times as these, and perhaps especially now" (57).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/feature/poundstone03/Genius.html">bottle imps</a><br />
Cool and fun, slide your mouse over the buttons on the opening screen and make a song!<br />
But it's so much more then that. The piece uses bottle imps to think about electronic literature (bottle imps are explained on the site)<br />
The author, William Poundstone, makes some interesting observations about electronic literature in his FAQs. He writes, "eLit is fundamentally a medium of artifice- of symbols that are perceived as symbols." Is that true? Certainly for much of what we have read--but not stories like "Afternoon" or "Disappearing Rain." Those texts seem more strongly in the camp of literature that attempts to draw readers into something real. Perhaps I'm confusing my definitions. But certainly hypertexts are eLit --</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In class and on the blog, people seem pretty unhappy when we read something really confusing, disarming, or requiring lots of technical back-flips (like running the computer in classic mode or using Internet Explorer). And I would put myself in that camp as well. I certainly see value in reading texts like "Lexia to Perplexia" and "Afternoon" where we are left bewildered and uncertain, but I wouldn't say it was the most enjoyable experience of my life. Again it recalls the question of whether or not the text is worth the work (ANY kind of work). And we've already talked about how sly books like Infinite Jest merit all the work they require (for me at least) while other hypertexts don't.</p>

I don't know how else to put it. I enjoyed reading this poem. The lines are layered, meaning that the lines of each stanza can change up to six times. Thus the stanza can be read in lots of different ways, yet they all make sense. It's pretty short, so I suggest you check it out.<br />
Like "Rain" it wasn't difficult to understand, but the format was aesthetically pleasing and really clean. The poem's lines could also actually be analyzed and discussed in an interesting way, it leaves more to interpretation.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We've already pointed out how Hayles talks lots about the importance of looking at print as a medium just as much as any other medium. That discussion got me thinking about the body in general. In "Material Met" she writes that there was an "emphasis on literary property as an intellectual construction that owed nothing to the medium in which it was embodied--With significant exceptions, print literature was widely regarded as not having a body, only a speaking mind" (32).<br />
Now Hayles is making a point about the importance of incorporating the material into the analysis of a text, not a point about the nature of physical bodies. But still--it made me think. We've taken our own bodies out of the equation when we post blog entries, run websites, even have IM conversations. I'm not sure what my larger point about this is. I just think it's a pretty strange situation when you have relationships with people and you don't need to involve your body in said relationship. There's a strong desire to want to remove your flawed, unreliable, mortal self, and computers make that possible. Of course any mass-produced text allows the author to remove themselves from the readers' minds. But those authors weren't really engaging in intimate, back and forth relationships with readers. Now we even have online dating situations where people can engage in dating before dealing with the body. That seems a bit ridiculous to me and a wildly bad idea. Isn't the body half the equation?</p>

The episode basically lampooned the sad existence of gamers who play their game of choice to the point of ending all other activities (including bathing and walking). This isn't exactly a novel idea, but I have to say that South Park did it in a ridiculously funny way. At the same time, though, especially in light of other posts about gaming, the whole thing was pretty sad in the old obvious ways: grown men who have no lives outside of their computer screen, kids who don't play outside so they can spend more time on the computer--</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Reading "Lexia to Perplexia" and "Disappearing Rain" close together was kind of a disconcerting experience because they were SO radically different in style and content. I showed my friend "Disappearing Rain," and he was not impressed. "Rain" definitely takes a much friendlier, easier to swallow form, and I think that one could end up thinking less of it because of its silly (maybe?), soap-opera like characteristics. I wouldn't say that it changed my life, but it was still interesting. It was also actually enjoyable, like reading a fashion magazine, because it was straightforward. I'm not saying it was simplistic, just that it was certainly no "Lexia."</p>
