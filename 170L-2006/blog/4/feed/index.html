 <description>&lt;p&gt;At a loss for words... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently reading up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wcbstv.com/watercooler/local_story_348114607.html&quot;&gt;Alternative Dance Competitions&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mc_frontalot&quot;&gt;MC Frontalot &lt;/a&gt; blares via Winamp in the background (more on the genre &quot;Nerdcore HipHop&quot; in... umm... never)... and i&#039;m realizing the internets [sic] are a wonderful thing. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/articles/06/12/14/1421235.shtml&quot;&gt;Slashdot debate&lt;/a&gt; pointed me in the direction of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2006/tc20061214_422859.htm?campaign_id=bier_tcc.g3a.rsst1214a&quot;&gt;Business Week article&lt;/a&gt; about a lawsuit that (from TFA) &quot;is reviving debate over whether Web overuse may be classified as an addiction.&quot; Not going to touch that one with a ten foot pole, but it goes something along the lines of &quot;Sure I was chatting in a sex chat room at work but... I&#039;ve got a serious addiction to the interweb so you&#039;re not allowed to fire me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>It&#039;s a damn fine Wheel. Stop trying to reinvent it.</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/523</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While watching The Onyx (i spell it &quot;onxy&quot; every time, backspace backspace &quot;yx&quot;) clips made available on the project&#039;s website one thought couldn&#039;t help but tumble about in my bewildered mind: What ever happened to Calista Flockhart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m referring of course to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118254/&quot;&gt;Ally McBeal. &lt;/a&gt; I never really watched the show, save for the off-chances when I could catch glimpses of the then-unknown-to-me Lucy Liu (*swoons*), but I remember a really big deal was made about the first few episodes, because there were all sorts of... *ahem,* &quot;wacky&quot; Looney-Tunes-esque computer animated graphics and what not integrated into the show... She sees an attractive male and her tongue starts wagging, or a co-worker says something frustrating and she shoots them with a bow and arrow or whatever...Her imagination being played out on screen and what not. I think the point was something along the lines of &quot;Lookit everybody! We&#039;re taking the traditional legal dramedy and making it all snazzy! Ally (yeah, you can call her that too!) is a normal person, just like you and me, and lookit all her madcap adventures and wacky reactions to the stuff that happens!&quot; I think a more important point is that by the second season or so (possibly earlier?) they cut all the animated crap and gave their audience the same old stuff. It won Emmys (are those the awards TV shows get? I don&#039;t really &quot;do&quot; the TV thing...) and etc but i&#039;m guessing the producers realized that the same old crap in a pretty bonnet is still the same old crap, and looks downright silly once people get bored of the gimmicky animated stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hypertexts That Push Back and th--whoa is that a rock?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/322</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit about me, because i just know you all care oh so much: I like silly. I&#039;m one of the English Department work-study stooges, and whenever i&#039;m in the English library shuffling stuff about i like to slide around on the rolling ladders. I can also devote oodles of time to mundane tasks with nary a second thought, a habit born of RPG grinding as a wee lad, or mayhaps time spent working at magazines / freelancing,  trolling blogs and newsfeeds and such for hours, looking for stories to pitch to editors and the like. I&#039;m also incredibly lazy. Frightfully so: deciding between going to get food or sitting on my ass is a difficult decision that requires a thoroughly contested list of pros and cons. I&#039;m also woefully inattentive / easily distracted.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Confessions of a Potion Drinker</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/232</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soulkerfuffle.blogspot.com/2006/10/view-from-top.html&quot;&gt;Found via Slashdot,&lt;/a&gt; it&#039;s a guest blog on someone&#039;s site, about a member of the World of Warcraft elite who&#039;s hanging up his... err... cloak? Axe? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of wish this blog had an Anonymous Coward option, but here goes: My name is GrumpyMutt, and i&#039;m an addict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I get the feeling i&#039;m doing alright. For those who won&#039;t bother to RTFA (slashdot-speak for Read The Fucking Article) the ex-Wow player goes on at length about the hazards of playing the incredibly popular MMORPG, talking about weight gain and skipping work / class and ruined relationships and etc. The comments that follow are also... intriguing, as a debate ensues (takes place on the slashdot site too) as to whether or not a video game addiction can be compared to a drug addiction. Umm... yeah. So i don&#039;t play WoW. I&#039;ve tried it, and to be honest, i got bored really quickly. But it does get me thinking: Hey, this is a lot like Diablo 2 (coincidentally, also made by Blizzard), except with more players. And updated graphics. And the Warcraft theme. And you&#039;ve got to pay to play it. And then i thought back to Diablo 2...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hey, you! Get offa my cloud!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/64</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up, i was the kid that hated &quot;Edutainment.&quot; Hell, i&#039;m still the kid that hates Edutainment. Reader Rabbit, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, Math Blaster... all those educational products thinly-veiled as &quot;Games&quot; that were &quot;Fun&quot; that my peers and i sat through in our poorly-funded Computer class back when i was wee. An inner-city public school in Brooklyn, New York, there were maybe four of those new-fangled Macintosh computers, single button mice and graphical interfaces, and most of the kids would fight tooth and nail to use them once class started, ooohing and aaahing at icons and the like while an anthropomorphic bunny explained the proper way to say &quot;gopher.&quot; Or something. Meanwhile, those who were &quot;in the know&quot; headed straight for the Commodore 64s that populated the rest of the room, in front of whose monochrome screens i spent countless hours trying to get my damn oxen to successfully ford the river, or blasting at rabbits with that pixel o&#039; doom that spat out of the mouth of my rifle. Ah, The Oregon Trail-- i can honestly say i learned far more about technology fumbling around with 5 and 1/4&quot; floppies, and far more about decision making and the like with a draconic UI (user interface... more on that in a sec), plotting the ideal time (April, in my humble opinion) to set out on that perilous journey out West (being hardcore, i was always the farmer). Having developed a rather irrational abhorrence of the Mac OS at a young age, i spent a lot of time roaming around the more affluent neighborhoods (Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, for those w/ some knowledge of Brooklyn&#039;s geography)  dumpster-diving for discarded parts until i pieced together my first working PC. Ah DOS: 5 or six lines of commands to accomplish what my Mac owning friends were doing with a single click of their &quot;Mouse&quot; (whatever the hell that was, i decided); i felt like some kind sagacious aristocrat: &quot;Your Mac has a calculator? That&#039;s cute. I just wrote a program that can add AND subtract in BASIC. Yeah, i&#039;m a badass.&quot; And then of course came my first copy of Windows (pirated, of course. i&#039;m realizing now i&#039;ve never actually *paid* for a copy of the OS) and my first mouse, and suddenly everything was so much easier! A calculator that could add, subtract, divide, multiply, etc. Microsoft Paint. File menus and folders to keep everything organized et wot, and everything just a click away... i&#039;d stumbled upon some kind of technological Nirvana, in 256 colors no less. Gone somewhat was that feeling of being some kind of Golden God, but at least the whole &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; didn&#039;t mean succumbing to the beast that was Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>[insert witty title here]</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/15</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine walking / moving and drinking something from a wide-mouth container at the same time. i suck at that. In cars, i always pick the absolute worst time to take that first fateful sip--a sudden start and i&#039;m suddenly coated in a cold wet layer of sugary sticky goodness. Or with walking, there&#039;s the persistent far-too-much-liquid-sloshing-at-my-face with the jolt of each footfall. That&#039;s sort of what my &quot;blogging&quot; experience has consisted off, trying to do too many things at once: sharing information whilst unsucessfully splicing in a bit of personal reflection with the end result being a rather unsavory batch of... well... b*tching and moaning.&lt;/p&gt;
