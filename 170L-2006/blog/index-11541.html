    <div class="content"><p>I have a bit of a confession to make, although perhaps others will say that they did the same thing I'm about to admit.  I used to play the Sims a lot, and I got really into it.  I created worlds that resembled mine.  Actually, they were more fantasy worlds than my own surroundings, and that's where my confession comes in.  My friend I used to pick boys we liked and "create" them, and (I bet you can see where this is going) create ourselves, too.  It was great: it was like playing a grown-up version of house, complete with cooking dinner, getting a job, and making babies together.  Of course, it all seems a bit sophomoric now, but I definitely used it as an escape.  For this reason, I loved reading about the different author's analyses to the Sims in First Person.  Ken Perlin's article especially resonated with me.  I liked the Sims because I became a sort of author, yet that "willing suspense of belief" (17) that the characters were real never came to me.  Granted, I did get extremely caught up in the people I "created" in hopes that their actions (which I, of course, controlled) would come true.  This ties into thisismycheese's discussion of the different types of immersion.  The Sims made me feel mid-way between the two types of immersion thisismychesse describes: I felt like I was in the game, as a character, yet I never truly felt like I was really there.  And I certainly never felt the same emotional immersion I feel when I read novels.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Alright, so I'm trying to play Adventure.  Rather enjoying this next week's assignments, great procrastinations.  In theory, that is.  In practice, this is utterly infuriating.  I am not a gamer in the slightest.  I know very little about any computer games, save solitaire and 8+ year old "educational" games, except they usually look kinda pretty, and are apparently addictive.  The extent of my knowledge of video games is being jiggly puff while my friends play smash brothers and i stand on edges, watching my little guy wave his arms around trying to maintain balance while everyone else beats the blazes out of one another (the one time I won this way, they wouldn't let me play again all night).</p>
<p>I don't know how this whole game thing is meant to work.  And quite frankly it's really ticking me off.  It doesn't make sense!  Help?</p>
<p>Case and Point:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Several people have offered confessions of one sort or another on our blog, including <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/232">Grumpymutt's confession</a> that he really enjoys playing video- and computer games, <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/234">marmalade's confession</a> that she is addicted to reading the New Yorker, and <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/236">Shock and Awe's confession</a> that he had never really thought about videogames from an academic perspective until the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Well, I have my own confession to make: I am not competitive.  And I worry about this because it's a stereotypically female trait.  Perhaps I should clarify: I <em>am</em> competitive about some things; I strive to do well at things I enjoy or I think are important.  But there is a difference between competition and diligence, and although I am regularly diligent, I rarely feel that that diligence is of a competitive nature-- and if it is, then it's more of a competition-against-what-I'm-capable-of-doing-type thing.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I had never really thought about video games seriously before the last couple weeks.  But the readings, class discussions, and blog posts caused me to look back on my own gaming experiences and compare them to my experiences with other arts.  One major facet of gameplaying, total different from my relation to other art froms, emerged: Competition.</p>
<p>The best games I played lured me into a war.  Immersion for me was throwing the controller when I lost, punching walls, and then feeling angry and silly for hours.  I have thrown books, shut off CD players in a rage, crumpled up artwork, but it was always because they were bad and I could tell, not because I was bad and the art had beaten me.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Shock and Awe's "Virtual Morality" (about the WoW virtual massacre)and Grumpymutt's "Confessions of a Potion Drinker" have twisted my mind about the intersection of reality and games.</p>
<p>At the risk of stopping everyone from reading my entry, I'll quote Michael Joyce:  "There's no simple way to say this."</p>
<p>     In six steps <strong>:</strong></p>
<p>1) I knew that WoW players burn hours and weeks "farming" for iconic "gear" that changes their gameplay circumstances and capacities. </p>
<p>2) I know that many players actually buy such gear -- I mean with real US dollars and similar currencies. </p>
<p>3) I've been told that such purchases actually make sense. I'm skeptical, but after all, one does put in the time "farming" to get the items; the time represents a real-world sacrifice that thus requires, I'm told, real-world compensation.</p>

Monday, for most people, is a big disappointment, but I'm always so excited to go pick up my mail... My father has accused me of being addicted--every Monday I would come home and lie on the living-room floor, not moving until I'd read it from cover to cover.  I had to try and do the NYer vicariously through the internet when I was abroad, and let me say that it was pretty horrible.  There is no cover to cover when it's online content!  Anyway, my mother thought she was doing me a favor and saved every magazine that came in that seven-month period--I came home to a desk overflowing with them.  I'd like to say that I read them all, but there was definitely a winnowing process that occurred...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'd be interested in hearing about more examples of very immersive books or games in which form calls attention to itself or that mix game and narrative. I'm not yet familiar with the examples mentioned in class, so I'm having trouble refining the idea. </p>
<p>Here's what I have so far. </p>
<p>1) We find games that involve less aspects of narrative to be more immersive.<br />
2) We find narratives that involve less aspects of gameplay to be more immersive. </p>
<p>Apparently, exceptions exist. An examination of how these exceptions mix the two might show much of how each and both operate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I suspect that stories and games become less immersive as they blend because the two forms relate to perceived reality in conflicting ways. Stories represent perceived reality. Games do not.  In the sense that I mean this, it's not less true of fanciful stories or photorealistic games. No one asks whether baseball is more or less realistic than football. Chess and even go are often supposed to be representative of war, but having played both for years, I don't see how. Computer games create worlds that involve extensive representation of familiar elements, but I'd argue that insofar as the user plays a game, the representational elements' primary function is to intuitively establish game rules. That is, if one sees a wall, one realizes that an obstacle exists without having to check the manual. In many RPG's, when one sees a bottle or a drumstick, that represents some capacity one can gain for one's avatar. Representational elements contribute to crucial semantics of play in ways that create a different world. The play world is not true or false, but different. Conversely, critics and readers reduce the fluffiest romance or the most unsubstantiated scifi to basic human desires and conflicts, however stylized. And we can talk extensively about particular nuances in the way the story is or is not authentic or truthful.</p>

<p>Kind of wish this blog had an Anonymous Coward option, but here goes: My name is GrumpyMutt, and i'm an addict. </p>
<p>That being said, I get the feeling i'm doing alright. For those who won't bother to RTFA (slashdot-speak for Read The Fucking Article) the ex-Wow player goes on at length about the hazards of playing the incredibly popular MMORPG, talking about weight gain and skipping work / class and ruined relationships and etc. The comments that follow are also... intriguing, as a debate ensues (takes place on the slashdot site too) as to whether or not a video game addiction can be compared to a drug addiction. Umm... yeah. So i don't play WoW. I've tried it, and to be honest, i got bored really quickly. But it does get me thinking: Hey, this is a lot like Diablo 2 (coincidentally, also made by Blizzard), except with more players. And updated graphics. And the Warcraft theme. And you've got to pay to play it. And then i thought back to Diablo 2...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So this post sort of goes along with <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/230">thisismycheese's post</a>, below, but we both seem to be thinking about different aspects of Moulthrop, so I thought it merited its own space.  </p>
<p>What interested me was Moulthrop's emphasis on what seems to be some sort of classical Greek structure.  While he admits that "We feel that narrative in certain conventional senses ... no longer animates the work we find most interesting as creators and/or critics" (58), he claims that a fulfilling narrative can be constructed around the old conventional principles, only using games rather than the novel, film, or theater.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, I was excited to see that <em>First Person</em> talks about gaming, as that topic has spawned a few of the more interesting conversations on this blog. What I wasn't expecting was how closely the articles would tie in with the conversations we've been having about electronic literature--and particularly the complains a lot of us have made about the artificiality/awkwardness of the e-lit we've looked at.</p>
