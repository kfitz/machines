    <div class="content"><p>I've been thinking about a question we posed in class last week but never really answered: Does the term "social software" encompass so many different programs and venues as to render it meaningless?</p>
<p>I kind of want to argue both ways on this one.  First, it does seem that "social software" covers almost everything we do on the internet, from AIM to blogs to MMORPGs to wikis.  So in one sense, no, the term isn't a very useful one if our goal is to distinguish between the different ways in which we use the internet.</p>
<p>However, in another sense, the term "social software" helps identify the common thread between the seemingly disparate things we do on the internet.  It's really all about socializing and communicating, isn't it?  Email and blogs and AIM?  Obviously about communicating.  But wikis?  They spark intellectual (and not-so-intellectual, depending on what the entry is) discourse between strangers.  Games? They set up characters through whom players communicate with each other.  Hypertexts?  They communicate an author's creative vision to readers, who in turn interpret that vision and talk about it with others who have read the hypertext.  This came as a revelation to me, although it sure sounds obvious now that I type it out.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Could the entire web one day be less like a catalogue and more like an incredibly knowledgable, helpful person?  This is the possibility that is driving proponents of a new movement, Web 3.0, which I read about in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html?ref=technology">New York Times article</a> this morning.  Apparently, our current web is version 2.0, and is characterized by its ability to seamlessly link many different documents, pages, and forms of media.  Web 3.0 refers to adding a new layer to the web-- that of semantic meaning, or 'intelligence.'</p>
<p>The author of the article explains, "Their projects often center on simple, practical uses, from producing vacation recommendations to predicting the next hit song.  But in the future, more powerful systems could act as personal advisers in areas as diverse as financial planning, with an intelligent system mapping out a retirement plan for a couple, for instance, or educational consulting, with the Web helping a high school student identify the right college."</p>

You might think 'Saudi blogger' is an oxymoron, given that Saudi Arabia is an incredibly restrictive place when it comes to communication and free speech.  But blogging has been growing incredibly rapidly in the Arabic-speaking world, just as it has in the Western world, during the past several years.  </p>
<p>Arabs use blogs for the same purposes as Westerners do: criticizing governmental policies, organizing protests, debating topics like religion, and simply sharing their personal stories.  What's particularly interesting about Saudi Arabian bloggers, though, is that equal numbers of women and men blog-- very surprising in one of the most conservative countries the world, in which women are prohibited from travelling without a male guardian or driving a car.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So several people have brought our attention to other cool things besides <em>Skin</em> on Shelley Jackson's website.  Something that I came across that no one else has mentioned is her novel, <em>Half Life</em>, which is published by Harper Collins, a big-name publisher, and has been (quite favorably) reviewed by such big-name newspapers as the New York Times and the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Now, although the above 'mainstream' apparatus surrounds her novel, Jackson has developed a little part of her website (which is less mainstream than the NYT) into a sort of advertisment/quiz/story that relates to her book.  She calls it the Mutant Typology Test, or <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/MUTT.html">MuTT</a>, and I highly recommend taking it.  You answer several pages of questions about yourself, which range from the mundane to the fanciful to the existential, and then it tells you what kind of a mutant you are are and explains what this means.  (No one is normal.)  If you click on the button at the bottom of the page that says "Get your prescription", the quiz recommends that you go buy <em>Half Life</em>.  The prescription is the same no matter what kind of mutant you are.  You can then click on a button that says "Fill your prescription," which will direct you to the (amazing) independent bookstore Powell's, where you can buy Jackson's book-- either as a hardcover ($24.95) or as a downloadable e-book ($15.96).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So election day is this Tuesday, and there's this interesting article in The Washington Post Outlook section today called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/03/AR2006110301472.html">You Tube? It's So Yesterday</a> about what the authors think some new uses of technology in politics will be in the somewhat near future.</p>
<p>They give a lot of examples, but three in particular were really interesting (and pertinent to this class.)  The first is their discussion of the incredible popularity of MMORPGs and how they have already started to play a role (no pun intended!) in politics.  Here's a (longish, but fun) quotation:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The question that <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/347">black lace</a> brought up of whether stickers are art or graffiti reminded me of a project someone did at Pomona two years ago.  Someone thought it would be really clever to post stickers that said "SIGN" on them on any kind of sign they could find.  They didn't just put them on paper signs, though-- they stuck some to walls and doors and other places from which stickers are very difficult to remove.  </p>
<p>Now, not only did it fall to the Housekeeping Department to scrape all of these obnoxious stickers off of Pomona College property, but the people who posted the stickers didn't draw a distinction between College property and individuals' private property.  Which meant that several postcards and other handmade, irreplaceable, personal things I had posted on my door got "SIGN" stickers slapped on them.  I was livid.  The gall some one must possess to believe that he has the right to deface my property or the College's property (that someone else will have to clean up) in order to accomplish an intellectually not-that-interesting project amazes me.  And that's what really got my goat in <em>Implementation</em>.  Not the story itself-- I really enjoyed the actual story-- but the part in which Samantha talks about her alleged ambivalence regarding the work involved in removing the stickers she makes and posts struck me as so unbelievably narcissistic.  Here's what she says:</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So after I came up with my final project idea, I ran across David Bellos' translation of a book by Georges Perec, a Frenchman, called <em>Life, A User's Manual</em>.  The idea behind the book somewhat resembles the idea behind my hypertextual neighborhood-- although Perec's idea was considerably more original, considering that his book was published in 1978.  Perec examines every room in an apartment block in Paris on the evening of June 23, 1975</p>
<p>There are several interesting aspects to this book.  For instance, despite its avant-garde structure, <em>Life, A User's Manual</em> was both a popular and a critical success-- almost a French version of <em>House of Leaves</em>.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I deliberately did not read Jill Walker's essay on Caroline (until 5 minutes ago) because I was hoping that I would have enough time to discover the end on my own.  But given that getting to the end apparently takes a minimum of 24 days, and that people would probably talk about the end in class today, I decided to bite the bullet and read Walker's essay.</p>
<p>And I was genuinely surprised at what was going to happen to Caroline-- and especially surprised at my own reaction: I felt worried and sad.  But then I asked myself why I should feel concern for someone who doesn't exist.  I felt sheepish, like I do when I cry in movies-- like, why should my emotions be so easily manipulable?  But then I realized that our culture considers it fairly acceptable to be emotionally affected by the fate of a character in a book-- or even a character in a movie or TV show.  So why not an online character, too-- especially one with whom I have communicated with far more than I have ever communicated with a character in a book, movie, or TV show?  I guess it just takes time for new media to gain legitimacy in our minds, even when what they're doing has ancient parallels.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>It seems like most people are pretty dissatisfied with Caroline.  Although I understand the desire for Caroline to seem lifelike, to seem like a person we would actually be friends with, I think that there are other important factors that contribute to the overall quality of an interactive website.</p>
<p>One of these is, I think, overlooked far too often, and it is this: interestingness.  I mean, yeah, I don't believe that Caroline and I are actually friends, but I <strong>am</strong> curious about how she will resolve the tensions in her personal life, and I do look forward to receiving her emails each day, which are full of enjoyable, self-deprecating, and self-conscious banter (better than some of the "real" emails I receive), and I do enjoy poking around the site.  The same is not true, for me, with Jemma.  She is not very interesting.  I don't care about her date.  Or studying physics in the UK.  But Caroline has a definite personality.</p>
