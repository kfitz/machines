 <title>Our own blogs</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/653</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&#039;ve been contemplating setting up my own blog.  It&#039;s exceedingly un-me to do so - or at least, me prior to this semester.  But I&#039;ve enjoyed getting my word vomit out on something that other people might actually read.  It&#039;s somehow satisfying in a way that a private journal would not be.&lt;br /&gt;
Problem is, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d blog about.  The best blogs seem to have themes - parenting blogs, political blogs, celebrity blogs, technology blogs.&lt;br /&gt;
What could I write about, besides &quot;Boring college blog&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
Do any of you have your own blogs, outside of this one?  What do you write about?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Spam on a blog</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/652</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amusing to me, as well, the volume of posts that have recently hit this site.  Not that I&#039;m one to point fingers.  It feels almost like we&#039;ve spammed the blog.  Now, I&#039;m not saying that our posts are irrelevant advertisements for penis enlargement.  I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s more along the lines of there are so many posts, with so many creative and possibly concealing names, that you can&#039;t possibly go through and read all the new ones.  It&#039;s just like when your email box gets a zillion new messages and you give up on trying to sort through them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s kind of like when Magoo was posting his fiction on the blog.  That stuff was really interesting, but the volume at which it came overwhelmed the rest of the blog posts and made reading anything but it somewhat of a search.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Who the heck is Cassie?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/650</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay.  So I posted about not knowing what happened with the Cassie stalker thing and pseudo anonymity.  I got the response from Natwwal that pseudo a. knew the identity, and is to be approached in person to find out the secret.  I say nay, class, we shall rise up against this secretive tyranny!  Tell us who Cassie is!  You sparked my interest with your project - you can&#039;t go all MIA on us now, P.!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>ruhh ruhhh RUHHH ZING!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/649</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;That is the sound my computer is making as of late.  Ruh, ruh, ruh, zing.  But more animated, like in the title of the post.  It gets all slow and confused and then explorer.exe starts taking up the entire CPU and it makes that noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I expect any of you to be able to fix it, as this thing is going on 4 years old and is probably about to hit the pasture, but wouldn&#039;t it be cool if things could be fixed by the sounds still?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like back in the day, when the people o&#039; yore would take their automobile into the shop and be like, &quot;Doc (they were always Doc), the car&#039;s got a problem.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;What sound&#039;s it making?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pseudo Anonymity, where are you?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/627</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know how his project with Cassie turned out?  I was quite intrigued by the whole stalker thing, and have been checking the final project page for updates....and it wasn&#039;t on the final project page, so I went through the facebook group &quot;Find Cassie,&quot; which doesn&#039;t have her identity revealed as of yet.....so I tried to find pseudo anonymity&#039;s blog on this blog, and I can&#039;t, for some reason (I went through each blog, the numbers at the end of the address, like mine is 18).....so I&#039;m reaching directly out to pseudo anonymity himself.&lt;br /&gt;
Hey, pseudo anonymity, or anyone else who might know.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Final projects - how long are we keeping these up?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/626</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So....uh....how long do you guys plan on keeping your final projects active and online?  I know this sounds like a silly question - why not just leave it up, for everyone to see and love and admire for all posterity or as long as the internet exists?&lt;br /&gt;
But mine kind of....worries me.&lt;br /&gt;
I mean, I know it&#039;s not Googleable.  I tried Googling various phrases and names from the family tree - no results.  But something about having THAT MUCH information online, accessible if you know how, and possibly accessible with later editions of Google or other search engines, freaks me out a little.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the stuff I said about people isn&#039;t bad, really, I swear.  It&#039;s just that I&#039;ve talked about EVERYONE in my family online, and that&#039;s a little scary.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Things I found on a blog</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/623</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this map-generator on my favorite blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world66.com/myworld66&quot;&gt;MyWorld66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It makes a map of all the places you&#039;ve been - countries, states, provinces, whatever you want to categorize by.  I really like this thing.  I love traveling, and frankly, I&#039;m the sort of person who would (and has seriously thought of) buying a map and putting pins on the places I&#039;ve been, just so I can see where I need to hit next.  Turns out I have a lot of traveling left to do.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>online finals</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/622</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My suitemate is taking econ up at Harvey Mudd, and I asked her earlier today about her final.  I know she&#039;s been studying for it, so I was being polite and asking when her suffering would be over (ie. the final time).&lt;br /&gt;
I was pretty surprised to hear &quot;tonight at 6,&quot; knowing the structure of exam times during finals week.  How could her exam be at night?  Was Harvey Mudd on crack?&lt;br /&gt;
No, it turned out, not in this sense.  Harvey Mudd is online.  It seems as if an increasing number of their courses (according to my friend) have their final exams through some internet moderator site that does these things.  They employ the honor system to assume you won&#039;t be using anything but the allowed notes, and then set a time for everyone to take it, in this case, 6 pm, and the site times the test.  It quits the application after the allotted amount of time is up.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>blogs?</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/621</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of days, when I haven&#039;t been studying or writing, I&#039;ve been checking my &lt;a href=&quot;metrodad.typepad.com&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;daddyinastrangeland.com&quot;&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;celebrity-babies.com&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; for updates.  When there aren&#039;t updates to read, I read the archives.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, people, I&#039;ve hit day one on most of them.  I&#039;ve read all there is to read.  And they usually only update once a week.&lt;br /&gt;
Which leads me to ask, what are you guys reading online?  I need to feed my blog addiction!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Make your own Zork!</title>
 <link>http://machines.pomona.edu.170L-2006/node/585</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes a little bit of fooling around to get the hang of, but you guys have to try this - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.classicgaming.com/ascii/download_files/textworld/textworld.html&quot;&gt;create your own text-based adventure game&lt;/a&gt;.  It ends up being just like Zork, or Adventure.  The program is called Text World, and basically you create rooms, which have descriptive intros, and make exits from the room, which you can block until the player uses an item, which you can also place in the room, and tell it what they need to type to find that item.  I don&#039;t so much get the &quot;create life form&quot; option, but in my game that I made for my boyfriend, the attempt at that one ends up getting killed when we &quot;give guard crack cocaine.&quot;  But I don&#039;t think he was blocking the entrance, so much.  He is just there to &quot;remove lifeform.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
