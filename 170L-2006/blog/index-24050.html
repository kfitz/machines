    <div class="content"><p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/washington/23fantasy.html?ex=1162267200&en=4e1a2bc1daa06c24&ei=5070&emc=eta1">article</a> from the New York Times again raises the question of the purpose of games.  It describes a new Fantasy Congress game (created by four CMC students!) that allows users to pick congressional teams (4 senators and 12 House members).  The creators wanted an alternative to the Fantasy Sports online teams/games that are incredibly popular.  I think this "game" ties into the discussions we've had in class and on the blog about the purpose of games and their use for educational purposes.  The final quote of the creator implies that Fantasy Congress can be a tool for popularizing politics: "Everyone knows about football, but more people need to know about Congress," Mr. Lee said. "If as many people knew about Congress as knew about football, baseball and basketball, we'd all be more educated."  I also feel Lee implies somewhat of a hierarchy of what being truly educated means, putting politics above sports.  I've never played Fantasy Sports and don't know how game-like these online fantasy teams are, but perhaps this game will make staying up-to-date on current events fun and get more people interested in politics.  In the end, though, I think people who are already interested in either sports or congress will be the ones playing.</p>

<p>I Link+-ed it because it had a chapter on hypertexts, but as soon as the librarian brought it out to me, I knew I'd not gotten what I'd expected.  It looked like a novel--a normal paperback--rather than anything remotely scholarly.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In discussion groups today, silversprung asked who ended up winning the great game debate: games as games or games as stories?<br />
We didn't answer the question perhaps because it required too much thinking for the beginning of class. But I'm still thinking about (well sort of) because it's evidently a sore spot for people even outside of the academic world.<br />
One of my friends is pretty into gaming (from a non-academic standpoint), and when I told him about the tensions over narrative in games, he immediately insisted that most good games are serious stories. Obviously, by intimating that games were not stories, I was somehow threatening their value, and belittling people who play them. But insisting that games are stories doesn't really help ludology become its own distinct thing if it so wrapped up in other fields.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I used to be a huge fan of Super Mario Brothers (back when we played on the old grey Nintendo box).  Today, I was remembering how, after my sister and I had been playing for an entire afternoon, the competition between Mario and Luigi would get pretty intense.  At times, I would find myself leaning to the left and right and jumping up and down as if, by moving my body, I could somehow more effectively move my player (I always had to be Luigi because my sister was older).  Sometimes, during her turn, I would press the buttons on my controller and jump up and down still believing that I could control her player.  Maybe I was just a little slow or caught up in the passion of Super Mario Brothers, but either way it seemed like I was really doing something at the time.</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="../node/265/index.html">Why aren&#039;t video game reviews more prevalent in the media?</a></h1>
      <span class="submitted">Submitted by Pimm on 23 October 2006 - 7:01pm.</span>
    <span class="taxonomy"><ul class="links inline"><li  class="first last taxonomy_term_90"><a href="../taxonomy/term/90/index.html" rel="tag" title="" class="taxonomy_term_90">video games</a></li>
</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I'm still intrigued by our discussion at the end of class today on the lack of video game reviews/coverage in certain newspapers or magazines.  During our discussion, I kept thinking the reason why there aren't as many video game reviews, even if the gaming industry is larger than the film industry, is a result of the demographics of who plays.  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cms/games/opening.html">This transcript</a> from a speech given by Doug Lowenstein (with an intro by Hnery Jenkins) at a conference hosted by MIT shows that I was wrong.  Granted, this speech was written in 2000, so I definitely need to update my statistics (which I'm having trouble doing), but it showed me that adolescent boys aren't the majority of the users.  For example, Lowenstein says of the most frequent users of video games console software, "We found that 65% were male, and 35% were female. 46% of the most frequent users of console games were under 18. 54% were over 18, and an astonishing one fourth was over 36 years old."  This made me even more confused why video games aren't more widely covered in the media.  Maybe, as someone in class pointed out today, true video game users spend so much time dedicated to play that they wouldn't be the ones writing the reviews.  And perhaps the people who control the more "respectable" newspapers/media have the same stereotype of video game users as I do (meaning, adolescent boys play, so those reviews don't need to be in, say, The New Yorker).</p>

Rather than trying to complete the game the urge is to romp around within in it trying to come up with outcomes that seem the furthest from what the creators intended.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I recently stumbled across this rather interesting simulation game that really lets you run with your narrative to wherever you want it to.  You are born somewhere in the world (based on statistical likelihood, like 1 in 5 times you play you'll be born in China), and from there, you age and make life decisions based on what is available to you in your country and social situation.  I've been executed in Iraq, orphaned in Russia, had to go broke to get my middle aged kids to move out in India, risen to the rank of a judge in Malta, and died as a baby several times in Africa.  You can also design your own character, which led to times like when I was a doctor in Denmark who forayed into modeling.</p>

<p>One has the following options:</p>
<p>1) Download a freeware editor at some place like <a href="http://www.tucows.com">Tucows</a>. Search for something like "WYSIWYG HTML editor" (the WYSIWYG just means you don't have to look at the code, or not muct).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Well, I have to admit that this was an enjoyable homework assignment. I left my video game habits, modest as they were, in a prior life, so the walk through memory dungeon was quite pleasant. Of course, returning to my old stomping grounds with a critical eye became an experience in itself. I played Zork long ago and far away, and at that point I had painstakingly mapped the terrain and finally bought a strategy guide to get me through a tough section that I cannot remember now, save for vague impressions of fire and ice. </p>
<p>This time around I was more content to wander and observe. I felt far from involved, and I watched my own reactions and the structure of the game much more than the actual play. I wanted to figure the game out, but in a totally different way than I once had. Perhaps this made it difficult to appreciate what the game brought to the table. Before my memory of command truncations and conventions kicked back in (hey, even if you never forget how to ride a bike, you may still wobble a little) I fought with the interface and reached some of the same frustrations that <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/258">night owl</a> did. The game felt clunky, probably as much because of my desire to pick it apart as my familiarity with more immersive environments.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>A fair amount of the theory we've been reading lately about games has attributed a good-sized share of the "immersiveness" of video games to the notion of agency in that we're not being pulled along by the capriciousness of authorial intent, but are rather able to freely explore within the boundaries of the game system.  Having grown up on games with interfaces sophisticated enough, or at least designed well enough to at least project the illusion of transparency, I found the experience of playing Adventure, and to a lesser extent Zork, to be incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>The interface for these games is so incredibly primitive that I did not feel a sense of immersion at all, except for a fleeting 3 minutes or so with Zork where it was all working, and the computer was not mysteriously denying my eminently reasonable requests.  It became easier as I grew somewhat acclimated to the system and what it could and could not do, but every few minutes, I would make what I thought was a common-sense command, and have it rebuffed.  Bang.  Immersion shattered.  For example, during most of my time spent with Adventure, I was being pursued through the damn catacombs by a dwarf who would throw "tiny knives" at me and then retreat whenever he got bored.  I had an axe at the time, so I tried to use it on the little freak.  No dice.</p>
