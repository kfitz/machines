A web page that I visit fairly frequently is <a href="http://www.popmatters.com">PopMatters</a>, a site devoted to pop cultural criticism. It's a warmer, fuzzier, more inclusive <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com">Pitchfork</a>, the main downside of which being its often unbelievably sappy contributors, who have the tendency to write <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/columns/article/6770/vamping-it-up/">book reports</a> instead of critical pieces. </p>
<p>Two recent columns (which I happened to read just now) escape this trap. Both draw upon nostalgia, but they go on to make arguments that I'm inclined to agree with, and which have enough relevance to the subject of our course that I was inspired to blog.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've just gotten back to my room from David Sedaris's reading in Big Bridges. During the program, it struck me how bizarre and trivial the situations he chooses to write about are. He writes about 45 minutes in the trailer of a small-time pot dealer, or about the difficulties of making coffee without running water, and <em>The New Yorker</em> prints it. I realize that he's mainly a humorist, but there's nothing light about the best comedy. His writing does what a lot of great writing does: it takes something small, something that would otherwise drift off in time, and unpacks it, lending it unexpected significance.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In Monday's class, my discussion group spent some time talking about Henry Jenkins's treatment of <em>American McGee's Alice</em>, a computer game in which the user plays as an adolescent Alice, returning to Wonderland. Only, as Jenkins points out, the world of Wonderland that American McGee crafts is openly creepy and dangerous. As the player fights his or her way through the game, Jenkins supposes that the attributes of this new Wonderland are read against the player's previous impressions (from the cultural dominance of the Disney version of the story). </p>
<p>Interestingly, I played the game back when it first came out, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen more than a few seconds of Disney's <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. Nor have I read Lewis Carroll's book, even though it's been on my shelf for years. I'm trying to think back to when I played <em>American McGee's Alice</em>, and whether I "read it against" anything. But I don't think I did. It would be pretty easy to make the argument that, even having never seen the Disney movie, I probably couldn't have escaped its place in American children's culture -- I know it without knowing it. Still, I've always found Disney stuff to be pretty creepy (all cartoons are a little bit creepy, aren't they?), and I know that Lewis Carroll had certain pharmacological proclivities. So I'm not sure how contradictory American McGee's Wonderland really is. I guess the point could be made that McGee's vision of Wonderland finally cops to its true nature, but by this point I'm not longer seeing what's so crucial about the reading/reading against aspects of the game. Comparison isn't really the game's voltage.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm interested in the idea of "agency," as discussed at length in what we've been assigned to read so far in (you know, I'm really getting sick of trying to italicize things and bringing up my Favorites menu) <em>First Person</em>. I couldn't help but think of our experience with <em>afternoon</em> and other hypertexts when I read Michael Mateas' explanation of agency: "Agency is the feeling of empowerment that comes from being able to take actions in the world whose effects relate to the player's intention. This is not mere inferface activity. If there are many buttons and knobs for the player to twiddle, but all this twiddling has little effect on the experience, there is no agency. Furthermore, the effect must relate to the player intention" (21). I know Mateas is talking about games, but some of our complaints about hypertext and electronic fiction so far seem to stem from our lack of agency in determining the course of the text. The counterargument until now has been that this lack of agency is somehow artistically productive, that it demands more out of us, or makes us aware of the medium to which we are responding. But the first two segments of (I don't want my Favorites menu!) <em>First Person</em> suggest that our desire for agency in these works may simply be poorly founded. Assuming that the ambitions of Michael Joyce, et al are narrative, deprivation of reader agency may be essential; Ken Perlin says that this is exactly what the novel does. So Joyce and company are maybe just teasing us with the promise of agency, the result of which is not a feeling of empowerment but a feeling of frustration, which feeds into the narrative thrust.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So maybe it's seemed as if I've been a little down on this electronic literature business. All along, however, I've conceded the immense potential for e-lit to develop into something undeniably important. Only thing is, I haven't quite been able to identify any particular elements of that potential. My thinking has been along the lines of, "well, the field of e-lit is obviously critically interesting, but what advantages does it really offer the author of works of art?" </p>

    <div class="content"><p>Every time I start trying to write down my messy thoughts about this material, I find that what I'm writing quickly turns negative in tone. Maybe this is because the thoughts are messy; I wouldn't exactly be the first person to not really like what I don't really understand. On the other hand, maybe there's a reason for my inherent, if mild, antipathy toward this stuff, and maybe that reason is informative.</p>
<p>In class and on the blog, we have definitely identified the resistance that the electronic literature we've encountered seems to have toward conventional readability. The theorists seem to regard this resistance as a virtue, while we have been considerably more suspicious. And justifiably so, I think. Here we've spent a few years learning to be increasingly serious about literature, and suddenly we're reading stuff that seems... hokey. Seems to rely on preciousness, fireworks and formal conceit.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Both of my English courses this semester have a significant blog component. This has thrown me for a loop. Where before I would while away the hours I'd set aside for reading course texts by surfing the internet, now that my homework happens to be surfing said internet, I find myself raiding my roommate's bookshelves arbitrarily. It's probably not a bad thing for me to be reading Sartre or DeLillo, but doing so is not going to help my grades any. Which I know deep down in my procrastinator's soul is a good reason for pursuing anything. </p>
<p>What I think may be another upside of my gpa-destroying behavior is that it indicates -- along with the sentiment of a great many of our blog posts, and the fact that most of us read our very first hypertext only last week -- that the novel as we know it isn't going anywhere. And not because the future tried to make its changes and failed, but because the printed novel and the hypertext happen to be separate media. Some of our trepidation about the e-lit age seems to be located in the idea that it will elbow out or somehow force change upon the things we cherish in more established literature. Were I not worried I'd sound like a dirty optimist, I'd confidently assert that the emergence of widespread electronic self-publication and the hypertext format will only strengthen the novel we know and love, in that it will help us triangulate what we find essential about the medium. TV and film co-exist, painting and drawing and photography as well, and the dynamics of each are unique enough to warrant their continued relevance. I have to think it's the same with text media. And having more data with which to determine what's important about different uses of the written word can only be a good thing, right?</p>

McLuhan makes a big deal out of the idea that media provide us with extensions of ourselves, but what if the medium is unreliable? I'm concerned only about the mechanics of the medium, not about the misrepresentation of any "real" world. I mean what happens when you reach for something and it's just not <a href="http://www.lakdnflsdkfponekdl.com">there</a>? Objects in the physical world rarely surprise us with their sudden absence; very few things seem to be there but aren't. We don't tolerate books with missing pages, or television signals that spontaneously drop segments from shows. But the internet, which we imagine will one day encompass all content everywhere, is full of dead links, of pages that don't turn. How many times has class in ITS been momentarily derailed by a misdirected browser? And thanks to our sexy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">embedded hyperlinks</a>, even search engines can't help locate the truant content of the blogosphere.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>tophat1's <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/55">Technology and the Future</a> post got me thinking (as did the fact that I was tophat1's discussion partner, which is why this is a blog post and not a comment)... One of Ong's basic points is that writing is a technology. So it is subject to the same good-or-bad evaluations that might be made about our newer, shinier, electronic technology. Accordingly, there is a fair amount of heady stuff written by important people (Ong mentions Plato, Rousseau and Derrida, among others) about whether writing is a good technology or a bad one. Writing gets credit from Ong, at the very least, for having "transformed human consciousness" (77).</p>
