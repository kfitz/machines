<p>~Was "Kind of Blue" originally emailed?<br />
~What impact does seeing it all at once instead of in controlled installments have?<br />
~What's that "after Blue Company by Rob Wittig" on the bottom of the main entrance page?<br />
~I wonder how an email novel would work on the page?<br />
~Hey, I read one of those years ago, time to look up "Exegesis" and share it with y'all.<br />
~Hmm, not quite what I remember, but still worth mentioning.<br />
~There's this other writing project called Exegesis that I'm just starting to poke and I'm not sure what I think about it.<br />
~The lack of a completely standardized keyboard (while I understand it's for issues of space) really irks me, because the muscle memory when I try to use the page up, page down, end &amp; home keys often results in nasty things happening.<br />
~Aesthetically, I really like ~</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I decided to investigate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennicam"> Jennicam</a>, the webcam girl who was mentioned briefly in class on Monday.  Wikipedia's information on her was interesting, but the information I stumbled upon that was linked that page was even more fascinating.  I clicked on another Wikipedia page entitled "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_whore"> Cam Whores</a>", which, according to Wikipedia, is "a term for people who expose themselves on the Internet with webcam software in exchange for goods, usually via enticing viewers to purchase items on their wishlists or add to their online accounts."  To learn more, I clicked on a link on that page to an article in The New York Times from December 2005 on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/19/national/19kids.ready.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5090&en=aea51b3919b2361a&ex=1292648400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"> Justin Berry</a>, a boy who at the age of 13 began using webcams in order to get more friends and ended up basically starting a pornography business.  For five years, he brought in tons of money from pedophiles.  There's a link on the left side to a 7-part interview series from the NY Times on him, and it is incredibly sad, moving, and fascinating.  His story, both about how he began his business and why he chose to end it by turning in himself and all his files to the FBI, made me think of our class for a few reasons, some more obvious than others.  First of all, I asked earlier about the word voyeurism, and this definitely seems like an example of it.  Secondly, when he talked about the pedophiles (who, creepily enough often ended up being people who work with children, such as teachers, pediatricians, and child lawyers), he mentions how he thought of them as "friends," though the friendship was completely constructed and often built on lies and an artificial web relationship.  Does this remind anyone else of Jemma?  Of course I'm not saying that Jemma played the role of either pedophile or pornographer, but it did ring a bell with me and made her forced friendship feel even more odd (and the promotion of her site to, say, teenagers as wrong).  Finally, Justin turned over the conversations he had with his "customers" that were logged on the computer, so, "Kind of Blue"-style, the FBI could (and is currently, I think) investigate them in a huge lawsuit.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I noticed that much of the discussion during our last class meeting about the closing line of Jill Walker's essay ("You don't play a simulation, it plays you") dealt with the idea of a "simulation" in mostly narrative terms.  However, I feel like this idea speaks to other forms in interesting ways.</p>
<p>For instance, we may examine it in reference to games.  Much was made in our readings on ludology of the idea of games as a "rules-based" experience, being more about our capability to manipulate the game world than about conventional narratives.  I've found that when I play a game of any kind, my way of thinking adapts itself to the rules and limits of a game space, and I may find myself enacting behaviors that I would not necessarily consider desirable or right in a real-world context.  For example, when I would play Civilization, which is pretty much my favorite game ever, I act at odds with my real-world beliefs because that is the best way to win the game.  The French are expanding too close to my borders?  Well, I'll just wipe them out then, and get that sweet, sweet land.  The citizens in one of my cities are pissed off? Well then let's see how they like a nice dose of martial law.  In real life, such actions would be repugnant to me, but the game, the simulation, has its own logic, which it imposes on you as a necessary step to success.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Silversprung's entry "Advice" brings up a good point. Websites and hypertexts that involve hundreds or even dozens of files can get cumbersome to administer if one does not have organized system of directories or filenames to help one keep track.</p>
<p>Keep the nomenclature so the web author can keep track of things. Readers/endusers will experience the site in terms of its linking, not in terms of filenames or directories, so these don't need to correspond. I suppose it would be convenient if they did, but I've never been so fortunate. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is counterintuitive, but I find that a fairly arbitrary system of classification affords the most flexibility in later editing. Here's why:</p>

<p>Two recent columns (which I happened to read just now) escape this trap. Both draw upon nostalgia, but they go on to make arguments that I'm inclined to agree with, and which have enough relevance to the subject of our course that I was inspired to blog.</p>

I'm one of the English Department work-study stooges, and whenever i'm in the English library shuffling stuff about i like to slide around on the rolling ladders. I can also devote oodles of time to mundane tasks with nary a second thought, a habit born of RPG grinding as a wee lad, or mayhaps time spent working at magazines / freelancing,  trolling blogs and newsfeeds and such for hours, looking for stories to pitch to editors and the like. I'm also incredibly lazy. Frightfully so: deciding between going to get food or sitting on my ass is a difficult decision that requires a thoroughly contested list of pros and cons. I'm also woefully inattentive / easily distracted.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I came across this <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9075-2430810,00.html">article</a> today proclaiming that Google just purchased Jotspot, one of the wiki sites KF recommended I look into as a forum for a final project.  The lead of the article states that this was the latest step in Google's "designs on the web 2.0 market."  I don't know exactly what this means, but it sounds like Google is trying to monopolize the programs it thinks will be influential in the next generation of web interaction.</p>
<p>Joe Krauss, the co-founder of Jotspot, was excited by the deal. "We watched them acquire Writely, and launch Google Groups, Google Spreadsheets and Google Apps for Your Domain. It was pretty apparent that Google shared our vision for how groups of people can create, manage and share information online," he said. While it is apparent that Google can use it's resources to increase the usefulness and availability of programs, I'm not sure I'm so excited by the prospect of a Google monopoly over the web 2.0 market.  Part of it is my old-fashioned fear of any kind of monopoly, but I also think it could lead to an over-centralization and homogenization of web resources.  I'd be curious to hear what the more tech-savvy among you think.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I feel like I'm becoming an internet stalker.  When I was looking up information on "Kind of Blue's" author, Scott Rettberg, I saw that he received his PhD from the University of Cincinnati.  I'm from Cincinnati, and although I don't love my city, I get oddly excited when I hear others mention it, so I decided to pursue him.  I found a link to his <a href="http://retts.net/">blog</a>, and from there the stalking began.  There was a link below to a site called "Jill" and, lo and behold, it was <a href="http://jilltxt.net/">Jill Walker's</a>.  From looking at the sites, and his intrigued me in particular, you can read how they teach at the same university and about their adventures traveling to, say, a Turkish bath.  Or you can scroll through his photos, posted on Flickr.  That's right, you can see pictures of his dog, his vacations, his family on Christmas.  Or you can look through an album of 10 photos of Jill, which has the heading "This set is mostly for me. Sometimes I want to see my girl."  That didn't stop me from looking.</p>
