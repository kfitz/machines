    <div class="content"><p>During a conversation today with magoo and thenewblack, we touched upon the ever-popular theme of materiality in texts.  Something magoo said reminded me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada#What_is_Dada.3F">Dada movement</a>.  I'm still a little unclear as to what exactly Dada is, but from what I've heard here and there, Dada can be pretty much any form of art that is also "anti-art," manifested through literature, music, art, etc.  Back in high school, I had a poetry assignment in one of my English classes in which my teacher asked us to create a poem using random words cut out from magazines and newspaper clippings; he said this was a form of dada-ism.  I think the point was to break our conventional idea of what a poem should be, and to be aware that there's more than one, fixed creative process.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I was reading Hayles's "Writing Machines," I couldn't help but feel skeptical about...well, to be brutally honest, the entire point.  I actually agreed with and was sympathetic to a lot of Hayles' points about media ecology, the bathtub theory of literature, and the continual evolution and enhancement of books alongside the progression of electronic literature.  In fact, I really loved when she said "as we work toward critical practices and theories appropriate for electronic literature, we may come to renewed appreciation for the specificity of print." (33)  However, despite all these great points that I could sympathize with, I was also skeptical about a lot of things, and in particular her analysis of electronic literature like "Lexia to Perplexia."  I'm not critical as to the actual content or analysis.  Instead, I guess my discomfort stems from a lack of clarity as to who the audience is, and the actual value of literary criticism.  So, I guess this entry isn't just a straightforward critique of an assigned reading.  It's more a pondering of why I am reading what I'm reading and the usefulness of what I'm learning.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Like Natwwal, I also really enjoyed Larsen's "Disappearing Rain."  I agree with Natwwal that the story is well-suited to the hypertext medium.  Just like Amy in the story, I was also searching for the answer.  I felt like the process that I was going through to reach an answer mirrored Amy's journey to find her sister.  I clicked on different links, hoping that each new one would lead me closer to an answer, and even if there was a disconnect between one link and the next, it was still hopeful because it felt like I was piecing together a puzzle. </p>
<p>At one point Sophie mentions a "modern electronic trap" and the narrator mentions how Amy needed to "systematically go to each URL on the list" as a means of getting closer to finding an answer.  As I was clicking on this link and that, I felt that I WAS Amy.  As much as she was trying to find her sister, I was also trying to find Anna.  This hypertext was the perfect example of how the medium enhanced the content.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I was looking through the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~iareview/tirweb/hypermedia/talan_memmott/">Lexia to Perplexia site</a>, staring at the pages with signs, symbols, and chopped-up words, I couldn't help but feel like this was more like postmodern art than any type of new literature.  The images reminded me a lot about the type of drawings and paintings in modern art museums that perplex me but supposedly have a message.  Since I'm personally very bad at interpreting art and have very little patience with art in general, I'm usually left more frustrated than enlightened.  I am no expert at postmodern or any art, really, but I do feel like postmodern art has this edgy, deconstructive aspect to it, and that much of postmodern art tries very hard to criticize or satirize more traditional art forms in this witty, ironic way.  I had the exact same feeling when I was browsing the Lexia to Perplexia site. I felt like this was an art form, in which the message was not so much the content itself, but more the medium.  And though Memmott says that his work was not intended to be critical but more "fictive," I still felt like there was an inherent critical aspect to his art.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So I was looking at the website that Professor Fitzpatrick linked, <a href="http://gimcrackd.com/">Gimcrack'd</a>, and I was thinking, "This is exactly what our wiki should be like, ideally."  One of the things that I really like about Gimcrack'd is that the site looks very professional and easy to navigate.  That seems to be a reason why certain blogs are popular too; the ease of navigation and aesthetics are pretty important, in addition to good content. I also liked how the stories on Gimcrack'd have some sort of linearity, some type of beginning, and that we are literally able to see the different possibilites.  You start in a certain place and then branch off on different thoughts, which physically appear as linked words.  You click the link, the relevant passage appears on the same page, and  you can delete it if you like.  Unlike Joyce's "Afternoon" in which you could only see one page at a time, this website allows you to open up almost all the links at once, and it definitely made me feel more in control.  It also allowed me to make more conscious decisions rather than blindly stumbling around.  It's also pretty nifty watching passages appear and disappear on the same page...it looks really cool too.</p>

<p>Shock and Awe's mention of the endless, daunting possibilites of gaming brought to my mind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">leetspeak</a> of gamers.  How many times have you had friends say "pwned" to you?

<p>Does anyone remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">these things</a>?  My mom got me one in sixth grade, and I was obsessed for several months afterwards.  I would bring it with me to school and feed it, play games with it, clean up its trash--all so that one day it would grow up into the "ideal."  Apparently, there's lots of different forms that each "pet" can ultimately grow into, depending on how well you take care of it.  If you were a superstar owner, it would turn into a beautiful cat-like thing, but if you neglected it, it often turned into an ugly tadpole-like creature and "die" young.  Basically our choices resulted in the final form.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Reading Michael Joyce's "Afternoon: A Story" was confusing, to say the least. I was very anxious while reading it, and there was a point at which I kept going in circles.  I tried going back and changing my choices, but I'd end up on the same several pages again and again...it took me a while to backtrack enough so that I could end up somewhere new.  If there's no coherent plot, does that make this "story" still a story?  I understand Joyce's point that we should participate in the creation of a text and give our own meaning to a story, but if that detracts from our comprehension of the story itself, then is the exercise futile?  I tend to agree with thisismycheese's point that Joyce seems to be using the technology for the sake of it, rather than because his particular "story" is well-suited for this medium.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The discussion in Landow about hypertext and poststructuralism makes me question if deconstructing the linearity of traditional printed material necessitates rendering books obsolete.  Several people, including Gunslinger and Frabby, have already expressed uneasiness at the idea of hypertext replacing books.  I also have a fond attachment towards books.  I don't necessarily agree when critical theorists like Derrida make statements like "changes in media have eroded the power of the linear model and the book as related culturally dominant paradigms." (47)  Why is linearity necessarily a bad thing?  Does the discovery of a new, more free form of reading texts have to involve antagonizing the previous traditional forms?  I feel like many of these poststructuralists truly underestimate the power of human attachment, memory, and emotion--and the historical cultural power and force of the book.  Just look at some of the previous entries with people's testimonies, like gunslinger's image of reading a good book at the remote family cabin or frabby's comment about parents reading their children bed-time stories.  Many of the critical theorists in Landow's piece are suggesting that the new technological developments are overdetermining the end of the book age.  Derrida even declares that "the end of linear writing...is indeed the end of the book." (47) I feel like the effort to decenter the author and institute active reader participation has been flawed in that it privileges these new media developments without considering the powerful, emotional pull that traditional print material has on people. Book culture and the hypertext culture don't necessarily need to be antagonistic forces.</p>
