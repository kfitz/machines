    <div class="content"><p>I read <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/09/22/TALKPHOBIC.TMP">this disturbing article</a> about how text- and instant-messaging has replaced actual human contact among many people.  It describes how people feel more comfortable with their online alias and conversing in the electronic world than actually talking face-to-face.  One teenager even said that "face-to-face you run out of things to talk about."  It strikes me as really sad that many people have lost their ability to be social human beings as a result of the internet and other technological gadgets.  Some say they feel more in control when they're texting or IMing, and that in face-to-face situations, "you're not presenting the real you, you're just reacting."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Because we've been mainly focusing on blogs as electronic literature, I've forgotten about the other forms of e-writing out there.  And then Marmalade's post made me remember one of my favorite online writing forms out there: fanfic!</p>
<p>My cousin has been maintaining a fanfiction site for about 4 years.  She's an avid fan of Harry Potter and creates her own Harry Potter tales based on the characters in the Harry Potter series. For those who aren't acquainted with the "fanfic" world, it's basically an "alternate universe" of sorts, with the stories based on popular media (books, movies, TV shows). Usually, the younger writers will write really sappy stories involving the love lives of main characters from a TV series or book, but among the millions of fanfic writers, you'll occasionally find an amazing writer, one whose works are even better than the original. Apparently, there are some Harry Potter fanfic-ers whose works and plotlines are considered to be even more original than J.K.Rowling's.  J.K. Rowling herself even admits to reading fanfiction in her spare time. As to whether the fanfiction influences her own writing, I am not sure, but that is an interesting question to ask, and brings up the issue of writer-audience interaction. The internet has allowed the writer to connect with her audience in a way that would never have been imaginable before. Does this mean that we, as readers, may even have input into and influence on our favorite authors' works?  How much do present-day authors cater to the wishes of the fans in the fanfic world, and should they?  It almost seems like writing a novel, which before seemed to be a closed affair for the author, has become an event for the public.  The Harry Potter phenomenon is especially interesting because the series hasn't even ended, yet there are thousands of fanfic-ers that have already written their own versions of "Book 7."  Quite unheard of before the internet age.</p>

<p>Hmmm. That's a great question, and a very hard one to answer.  I started out by replying to the comment, but then I realized that my comment was starting to get really really long and that I was going off on all sorts of related and unrelated tangents, triggering much incoherent rambling.  It was starting to turn into an exposition on all my feelings, as an individual, towards blogging and technology in general.  So, I thought maybe this should stand as a separate entry, instead of merely a comment.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>My art history friend made a comment today about different stages and movements in the art world, and that got me thinking about the various stages and progress in the world of media and technology.  What stage are we in and is there a foreseeable end to this technological madness?  As a bird pointed out, Vannevar Bush did an amazing job at predicting, in 1945, the technologies of the future, including giving us a beautiful description of a "memex."  My question is, what's next in the digital world?  Will there be a point in which the digital age is rendered obsolete, and if so, what will be the next "big thing"?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>When I read Burnett's article, I kept thinking about the millions of movies I've seen in which robots take over the human world and wreck havoc on us.  I was reminded of films like "I, Robot" (a movie which I've never actually seen but apparently involves robots taking over the world) and the "Star Wars" series.  Hollywood seems to enjoy portraying robots as dangerous creatures with the power to destroy their own human creators.</p>
<p>Burnett also brings up the power struggle between humans and machines. He says there's a "'natural' and negative 'gut' reaction to the idea that machines may have more power than humans do." (123) I wonder, though, if this fear of technology and machines' "power" is a bit over-exaggerated and silly.  Yes, computers are powerful, but they're only powerful because humans gave them that power. Yes, a computer beat Garry Kasparov during a game of chess, but it was humans who programmed the computers to calculate in the first place.  I am also unclear--and pretty skeptical--as to the usefulness of the debate about machines threatening human individuality.  Perhaps I'm simplifying the situation too much, but to be perfectly frank, I often have a hard time figuring out why people like Burnett are just so fixed on anthropomorphizing machines. I see machines as machines.  When he asks questions like "Can a machine feel pain?"(126) I am not sure at all how to answer his question.  I even wonder, "Is he seriously asking this question?!" WHY is he asking this?  Perhaps I am too practical a person and cannot use my imagination.  Then again, my other cynical side tells me that humans are just egotistical and obsessed with themselves and therefore must attribute human qualities to everything.  An annoyingly frustrating endeavor, in my opinion...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don't read too many blogs other than the journal blogs that my friends keep, but there are a select few that I'll care to skim every once in a while.  One of them is the San Francisco Chronicle's <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/indexn?blogid=3">Culture Blog</a>.  It's a "collaborative" blog written by the Chronicle's writers, editors, columnists, and covers pretty much a wide range of topics from pop culture, to fashion, to movies and music, to sports...pretty much whatever interests the writers in their spare time.  The categories are many, the frontpage lists all of them.  I really like to skim this blog occasionally because, in addition to quirky and entertaining entries about Baby Superheros or political commentary, there's occasionally entries that talk about San Francisco culture and stories about going-ons in local neighborhoods, and as a San Francisco native, it's always fun to run across a blog entry that talks about, for example, my favorite hole-in-the-wall local greasy spoon establishment or the latest street fashion in the Mission District.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Most of the blogging that I've done these past few years has been on the wonderful but, admittedly, very "high-school-ish" site called <a href="http://www.xanga.com">Xanga</a>.  It's pronounced "zanga." :) Xanga is very much like Livejournal, where the blogger creates an account for herself and then proceeds to musing/journaling/ranting, usually about everyday encounters, and in my case, college life.  I would say that about 90% of the "blogging" that I do is on xanga, and what keeps me going back is the large community of "xangans" that I keep connected to in this community.  It's basically a process of reading friends' "xangas" and commenting on each other's xangas, keeping each other updated on what we're feeling, thinking, eating, etc. I'm sure xangas (yes, we call these things "xangas" instead of "blogs") are not considered legitimate according to the definition of some of the A-listers we read about in the text, but in this busy college world, these xangas are a good, convenient way of knowing what's up in each other's lives.  Xanga also has features called blogrings that allow people with shared interests to join, thus connecting individuals with others who have similar tastes in a particular topic. There is even a Pomona blogring, and that is where I do most of my xanga-ing.</p>
