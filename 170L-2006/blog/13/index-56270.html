<p>It talks a little about how a president's image can change on campus based on what he or she writes on their blog, and that it is also dangerous for presidents to do such things because his or her critics can take comments made on the blog out of context and use them as ammunition against the president in the future.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>After the discussion during the last class about majoring in video games, I decided to do some research and found out that lo and behold! There are MANY big universities that offer video game majors! This NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/22/arts/design/22vide.html?ex=1290315600&en=f26dbe96bc527f0e&ei=5088">article</a> from last year talks about how there are undergraduate and graduate programs in video game design and "interactive entertainment" springing up at bigger universities including the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>Although this field is not widespread in academia, I still think it's an exciting start.  This short <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6484624">NPR audio file</a> talks a little about video games too.  USC enrolled its first class majoring in video game development this year.  There are students in the clip who talk about video games in a very literary way too.  One guy says how he's "very much a postructuralist, this is very much a Michel Foucault video game." Sounds pretty much like academic lit crit to me. The news commentator definitely makes the point that some of the students talk more like literary critics than game designers.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading the first few chapters in the "book," but as the author started getting overly theoretical with his ideas and new words like agon, alea, heterotopia, and atopia, I had a difficult time following along.  I thought it was interesting that McKenzie chose to talk about these ideas in such an extensive manner and didn't actually concretely define what he meant by each term until the <em>fifth</em> section, "Atopia."  By then, he starts defining alea as "chance" and agon as "competition," (card 115) and I literally had to write down all his definitions and constanty refer to them in order to remind myself of what he was referring to.</p>

<p>I noticed that this week's topic on the syllabus is "the networked book" and GAM3R 7H30RY (which is a huge hassle to type because of the author's decision to alternate between numbers and letters) is our sole reading.  I know that this in no way limits our discussion of GAM3R 7H30RY to just issues relating to the networked book because GAM3R 7H30RY itself has a lot of interesting ideas in it about gaming/theory that we could definitely talk about, but I realize that its strange and unique form is a huge topic of discussion in itself and may replace discussion of the content itself.  I mean, look at me right now.  I'm merely talking about the format rather than the actual content because the format is such an interesting issue.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I sometimes wonder why I respond a certain way to different forms of social software and technology, and was wondering whether other people felt the same way.  </p>
<p>Lots of posts have been floating around that talk about creating identities for oneself online.  IM-ing, facebook-ing, and blogging are second nature to me; when I'm doing work on the computer, I'm always signed onto AIM because to not be signed on just seems unnatural to me.  It feels normal and natural to have the buddy list open on the right side of my screen.  </p>
<p>I read an article a few weeks ago on the <em>New York Times</em> website (which I can't accesss anymore because it's been archived and I don't want to spend $5.00 getting a copy) about the "overconnecteds."  It refers to "Generation M" aka the generation of kids born between 1980 and 2000 who grow up accustomed to technology and the computer/internet world.  Whether this is a good or bad thing is a relative judgment, and depends on what the internet is being used for.  I definitely agree with <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/442">marmalade</a> about the sink of time and effort that one puts into developing, oftentimes, "fake" relationships, and for me, the amount of time I spend randomly browsing blogs or facebook or IMing is atrocious, and I should really learn to cut down this habit.  On the other hand, we all realize how cheap, useful, and efficient software like AIM is if we have friends on the other side of the country or in other countries whom we otherwise wouldn't get a chance to talk to.  For that, I'm grateful to social software.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I'm still trying to find my way around social software, and I'm even wondering what <em>isn't</em> social software, because it seems like <em>everything</em> qualifies.  To go along with this ubiquitous nature of social software, people are suggesting that forms of this software are becoming more prevalent in the academic sphere, which is of huge relevance to us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog">if:book</a> has many articles that talk about networked writing in academia.  A few things that struck me as more interesting--</p>
<p>1) Google offers <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2006/08/googles_window_on_the_public_d.html">public domain downloads</a>.  These days, this isn't anything new, since public domain documents have always been available online, but we--or rather, I--keep forgetting that this wasn't always the case.  The book publishing industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, and making texts available online won't significantly affect their earnings, but there are advantages for us, the consumers.  These days, I don't buy all my books anymore.  As an English major, there's lots of books to read, but I often either go to the library, or find downloadable versions online.  As a consumer, I'm thankful that books are finally available for free.  To me, the idea of putting books online in downloadable format refocuses the attention on the books as material to be read rather than commodities that make profit.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, we read about social software and its various forms this week.  A few thoughts after reading/browsing through the websites--</p>
<p>1) Is it just me or does "social software" seem like a highly vague and generic term that pretty much describes almost everything that we do online?  The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_software">entry</a> defines social software as media that "enables people to rendezvous, connect or collaborate through computer-mediated communication and to form online communities."  Wikipedia's list of social software encompasses anything and everything technology/communications related, including several topics we've already covered in class like blogs and video game worlds.  My initial reaction was that it seemed almost daunting and impossible that we attempt to cover "social software" in just one week because such software seems to include enough material for an entire semester's worth of discussion.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In my search for online images and backgrounds for my final project, I came across a site that reminded me a lot of Shelley Jackson's Skin.  The site is called <a href="http://www.noveltwists.com/">Novel Twists</a>, and it basically is a piece of collaborative fiction comprised of a total of 150 pages, and people bid for the right to contribute a page.  I tried to find the ebay aunction site where this was going on, but I failed.  It's probably privatized or something.</p>
<p>Anyway, this project is very similar to Jackson's Skin.  It also relies on the premise that this is a collaborative project with a limited number of participants who don't know each other.  Here, though, the participants aren't as thoroughly screened as those in Jackson's project.  Rather, the winner/writer of each page goes to the highest bidder, and then all the proceeds go to charity.  Quite an interesting way to raise money, don't you think?</p>

It seems like if we were to simplify the concepts behind <em>Skin</em> and <em>Patchwork Girl</em>, then it would seem like Jackson is creating a giant jigsaw puzzle.  </p>
<p>When I first looked at the <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html">frontpage</a> of Skin, I was misled into thinking that her final project was supposed to be presented as a giant collage/puzzle of the people's tattoos.  <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/368">Pimm</a> also linked us to Jackson's tatooed people's <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart">community blog</a>, in which someone mentions that "I am we," which seems like the individual does acknowledge that he or she is like a puzzle piece in a larger collective identity. Not to strip people of their humanity and say that they're/we're all puzzle pieces, but it does seem like Jackson's hinting at this concept with her work.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was very intrigued by Shelley Jackson's <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html">Skin</a> project. The idea that "each participant will be known as a word, and as words die, the story will disintegrate" is fascinating, and I'm also a little disturbed at how destabilizing this can be for a text. (12)  </p>
<p>Walker calls this a form of distributed narrative, and it's a perfect example of her so-called "feral hypertext," an undomesticated and wild text.  My question is, if this narrative is written in such a way that it cannot be read, is it still a narrative?  It fits under Walker's definition of what a distributed narrative should be, but for the unsuspecting reader/viewer, would we approach this as a work of art and not even consider it a narrative?  For me, I saw the project's <em>concept</em> as the story which the author is telling, rather than seeing the actual content of "Skin" as the narrative.  Does this make sense?</p>
