    <div class="content"><p>There was an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/technology/02compute.html">article</a> in the New York Times today about how MIT and the University of Southampton in Britain announced today that they are starting a joint Web science program at their schools.  The gist of the article is that the web is becoming more important these days, and that an academic understanding of the web and technology doesn't merely involve knowledge in computer science but also study of social behavior and networks online.  </p>
<p>This seems pretty relevant to our class and this blog.  There were a few blog posts <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/328">here</a> and <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/320">there</a> and others that have talked about privacy online and in blogs, with references to access of information and the very public nature of very personal information.  We usually talk about privacy in terms of creepiness and stumbling upon information that we <em>feel</em> like we should not be seeing even if it's public domain.  It's appropriate that when Web Science becomes an actual field of academic study, that will be one of the main areas of research, since it is such a huge and controversial topic.  I just think it's pretty cool that this new field will be so interdisciplinary.  It's a step in the right direction, since I feel like when most people think about web-science they're thinking strictly in terms of the computer technology aspects of it but now, with such programs in place, people will be more aware of the sociological aspects of the web.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Something that Jill Walker mentions in her essay about Online Caroline reminded me of a flash video that I'd seen recently.  I briefly touched on the Big Brother issue at the end of my <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/295">last post</a>, but then I remembered this really relevant video.  </p>
<p>Walker talks briefly about the Big Brother aspect of sites like Online Caroline, and then she alludes to the similar "adjustment to user's behavior [that] is used a lot in marketing." (304) For example, "Epinions.com arranges articles so the ones I see first are ones similar to others I've liked, or are highly rated by people whose writing I've rated highly." (304) And, as we all know, Amazon.com does the same thing, which I find extremely useful, except for the fact that the database <em>is</em> managed and processed by a computer rather than a human, so every now and then my amazon.com will think that I absolutely love emotology books about Latin roots and send me millions of such recs just because I ordered that <em>one</em> emotology book five years ago when I was studying for the SAT Verbal section.  I'm sure we've all run into this problem before, and it reminds us that indeed computers are still just computers and not humans.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I first logged onto Online Caroline for about 30 seconds, looked around, thought she was a real person, and then logged out.  I thought she was just another blogger.  I was tired that night and decided to put off "playing" with her until the next day.  </p>
<p>The next day, I read Jill Walker's essay on Online Caroline.  It was during the reading that I realized Caroline was fake.  I "spoiled" the story for myself before I could even start my "friendship" with Caroline.  I walked into this "relationship" already skeptical because of Walker's analysis, and after about 10 minutes of being Caroline's "friend," I was convinced this was not for me.  I echo a lot of skepticism that others, including <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/293">crashingintowalls</a> and <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/283">tophat1</a>,talk about in their posts.  I mentioned in some comments in other people's posts that the over-friendly tone, though aimed at making the situation believable, actually has the opposite effect.  Caroline's attempts at moving this friendship forward had a negative effect on me.  The web designer's "tools" of friendship, including personalized emails and a conversational, direct tone makes the "player" realize that this situation is forged, fake. Like other people have mentioned, the personalized email does not feel personalized--rather, it seems contrived to me.  It seems to me like the web-designers are forcing the friendship onto the participant, wanting desperately for us to buy into their scheme.  But, as many of these posts seem to suggest, it hasn't been working for the most part.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>How appropriate! Just when we were all lamenting over the lack of videogame reviews in the media, I open up my browser and lo and behold! a videogame review appears on the frontpage of my city's online newspaper site!  The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com">San Francisco Chronicle</a> occasionally reviews videogames using the same rating system that they use for films.  The clapping man jumping out of his theater seat is a sign that the video game is super awesome.  Anyway, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/24/DDGSCLTG6F1.DTL">this videogame review</a> rates this new videogame called Bully. This is an "immersive boarding school experience" where you have to play "Tough kid Jimmy" whose "weapons of choice were itching powder and wedgies." Cool!</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Transmedia. The future of media and gaming?  Or rather, is the future now? Henry Jenkins writes that "transmedia storytelling...depends less on each individual work being self-sufficient than on each work contributing to a larger narrative economy." (124)  He includes books, film, television, comics, and other media, "each doing what it does best, each a relatively autonomous experience, but the richest understanding of the story world comes to those who follow the narrative across the various channels." (124)  </p>
<p>I've asked some friends who like gaming whether they feel this is true, and they seem to think that the best games are those that don't belong to some "narrative economy."  Stand-alone games that don't seem to have a narrative arch like CS and Diablo are, as we all know, really popular and it doesn't matter that there's no background story.  Video games that involve Harry Potter and other non-computer-media based characters don't do as well, in terms of sales.  Why is this?  Is the fun of the game lost in the attempt to make a videogame an accurate representation of the particular book or film?  Do the constraints of the characters' book world or film world limit what the videogame player can do? Maybe I was asking an audience that just happens to not like such "transmedia" works, and I'm making too rash of a generalization?  Still though, it seems that the most successful--and I'm defining success by sales and sheer number of players worldwide--games have not been the "transmedia stories" but instead stand-alone videogames.</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I started to play Zork, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  I started out in front of a white house, on the edge of a forest.  I thought this would be similar to the experience of interacting with Eliza, a simple exchange of user prompts and computer-generated responses. Boy, was I wrong.  As I found out after several hours of stumbling around in Zork-world, the white house and forest actually sit on top of an elaborate underground empire called The Great Underground Empire, complete with secret rooms and monsters to kill!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've really enjoyed reading everybody's posts on videogaming, confessions, and the like.  It seems like the topic of video games is broad enough that everyone has their own personal stories and memories of what videogaming means to them, whether it be Sims-style creations or the shoot-and-kill variety like CS and Diablo.  What about happy memories of games like Oregon Trail, or Carmen Sandiego in elementary school? Does anyone remember playing video games, or rather, computer games in schools?  </p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061017/ap_on_sc/video_games">This article</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5398230.stm">this article</a> talks about the various effects of using computer games in school. I feel like the idea of harnessing the popular appeal and power of video games and using them as an educational tool in schools has been around for at least a decade.  The author of the first article writes that "scientists call it [video games] the next great discovery, a way to captivate students so much they will spend hours learning on their own."  I feel like it's a little late to make a statement such as this, since educational video games have been around for a while now and companies learned long ago that videogames are the "next great discovery."  The points that the article makes, though, definitely hold true and I can personally identify with a lot of this from grade school memories.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of essays and commentary in Wardrip-Fruin and Harrigan's <em>First Person</em>.  I thought the format of putting responses and commentary directly below their respective essays on the same page gave us a nice contrast of opinions and points.  It also reminded me of our class blog, and I thought it was cool that the book was able to achieve this blogging/commenting feature in print. </p>
<p>I don't know how everyone else felt, but the physical experience of reading <em>First Person</em> was also a little strange and bewildering to me at first.  Usually when I'm reading for a class, especially if it's a really long book, I really like the feeling of finishing a chapter and moving on.</p>

<p>He contrasts the non-agency of reading books or watching movies with the hyper-agency we experience when we play video games, calling for the creation of a suitable form that can properly combine both.  I think during this current stage of videogaming, Wright's response to Perlin's essay is a more relevant and realistic discussion, especially when he says he wants players to "play better stories."  That seems most important to me; I feel like that strategy stays true to the goal of games while also respecting player agency.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I think in the last 12 hours or so, my conception of hypertext has drastically changed from skepticism to new-found appreciation.  It all started when I was randomly looking through our course wiki, clicking on the various links and trying to figure out if there's a connecting or overarching theme behind the mess of links and witty mini-stories.  </p>
<p>Then, after sitting there for about half an hour, patiently going through pretty much all the links, I realized (kinda late, yeah I know) that the point of this collective narrative was to make those connections yourself and to connect the dots as we like.  That sounds like a rather obvious and "duh!" statement, but I honestly did not truly understand how that felt until I decided to try it out. Part of my initial frustration with our class wiki was the feeling of shooting blindly, not knowing even where to start.  It seemed to me like we were getting used to this new environment and playing around with inserting cute links rather than focusing on making a connected story with some semblance of coherence.  I realized last night, though, that the process of creating a collective hypertext really does need that initial random, blind stumbling in the beginning in order for it to go anywhere.  There needs to be a starting point, and somebody among the twenty-or-so of us needed to be that initiator.</p>
