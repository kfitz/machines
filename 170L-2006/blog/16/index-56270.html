    <div class="content"><p>I don't know why, but I just have to force myself to be anything more than the tiniest bit interested in the stories at <a href="http://onlinecaroline.com/">onlinecaroline.com</a> and <a href="http://planetjemma.com/">planetjemma.com</a>.  Having to put in my email address already makes me cranky, and thinking about getting emails from these sites makes me realize that I will probably do what I do with all other emails, which is leave them piling up unread for as long as possible while I assure myself I will read them later.  I don't know what it is...I'm still trying to figure out my stubborn resistance to it all.  Something about getting these standard responses to my interactions with the characters...  I don't really want to fill in my personal details and answer quizzes so I can get these limited replies...won't it probably just come down to how much I can mess with the format and try to get unique responses?  I haven't read through all of "Kind of Blue" yet, but I'm immediatly more interested in it.  Reading something that I can pretend is personal and real is more captivating for me than reading emails that are trying to make you think they're personal and real because, really, all their trying does is make it more obvious that they're not what they're trying to be.  Does that make sense?  These are my early impressions so who knows, maybe I'll get more drawn into the stories of "Caroline" and "Jemma"...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've been overthinking things for as long as I can remember.  I overthink the fact that I overthink everything.  I analyze absolutely everything and come up with these explanations of why I subconsciously didn't do what I said I was going to do or what someone really meant when they said something to me.  Buying things involves a very complicated process of very, very carefully weighing out all the pros and cons and selecting the exact item I want.  If I don't have enough time to go through this complicated process, it's hard to feel...satisfied. Thinking is good but thinking, hard indulgent thinking, about your life and why this happened and what you would say if you could go back in time and what you should be doing and what other people think about you...it's all f*cking exhausting.  I've been thinking (ha) about why it's so hard for me to write in here sometimes...I find myself thinking about the blog more than ever actually doing things with it.  (And I use too many ...'s).  My complete inability to just do, act, write is kind of a problem.  This blog isn't a place where I could just sit down any day of the week and write about what I'm feeling at that very moment or how someone in a crowd puked, just a little, on my leg last night or how my sister keeps leaving me messages with her cat meowing into the phone followed by a "snufflebunny says hello!" or "emmybemmybear wants to say hi!" comment.  This blog has a strange mix of academic and personal and I can't always figure out what to do.  It's hard for me to write first reactions to material and first thoughts because you always have to be checking yourself-- does this make sense (making sense is obviously not always an easy task), did someone else already say this in a more concise and coherent way, am I going to completely change my mind once I read that article I haven't printed out yet...and then I just get bogged down in it all. I suppose I really just need to get over it.  This is really more of a self-indulgent whining post than a post that "matters" so to speak...Sunday nights get me in a certain mood (the line that always comes to me is from these stories that I used to read when I was little that were about this badger named Frances and her viewpoint of the world..."Homework sits on top of Sunday, squashing Sunday flat")  But yeah, the academic stuff will come later tonight.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I came across this article <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/21989/index.html">"The Human Blog"</a> about Arianna Huffington.  It's a lot of promotional stuff and blah blah but it did make me think about the nature of the blog and the nature of the person who is participating in most of the technologies (and the communities that arise because of them) that we have today.  The article states, "Everywhere she goes turns into a series of links, links that lead to other links. She's a human blog."  At first this just seems like one of those tagline throwaway sentences, but then I started wondering how it might have some relevance. Further down in the article the author claims,  "her ability to shift swiftly from topic to topic, her swashbuckling political rhetoric, her penchant for attention-getting--are what the online world is all about."  It links the online world to the idea of popularity and "contagious ideas."  All this interconnectedness and sharing of information, and sharing information quickly and being blatantly honest and persuasive, well, it's working for her, right? Influential people use her blog as a place to put out their opinions, and she gets to orchestrate the whole thing.  The article seems to be suggesting that a certain kind of person will excel in the online world...does this mean that some people are better suited for the world of print?  I guess where I might go with that is, well, if Huffington is more successful in the world of blogs, and there are obviously other people who find the most success in the online world, how is their influence different from the influence of those who have success in print? Does someone like Huffington gain influence because her work is constantly on the computer screen and constantly changing, because her work can shift continuously?</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>After reading through all the posts I somehow sort of got fixated on the idea of avatars (although I don't really know much about how that term is used other than as a visual representation of a person or a kind of virtual body used to represent the actual body...but I guess I'm bringing it up because I'm trying to convey the idea of a self-representation).  A representation of an individual can exist as an autobiographical text or maybe a self-portrait or a musical composition...but now it can also exist as this big jumble of different types of media.  Online profiles, for example, can have text (including lists and links to websites), pictures, videos, songs, blogs, ways of contacting the individual (which takes different forms like phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, screennames), representations of networks of friends (with their pictures and names that they choose to represent themselves), results of online surveys (are you a slut, what cocktail are you, etc), animation, and other things I'm probably forgetting.  I guess I'm just interested in how people use interactive media to represent themselves and how our view of an individual changes depending on how we interact with their personal representation.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've been stuck on this quote: "I am afraid that one of the things that makes the web in its current form so attractive is that so many of us are afraid and lonely and do not know what to think or who will hear us" (from Joyce's "Othermindedness" p52).  I've been thinking about the theme of loneliness lately in connection with people who create content and put it on the web where it can be seen by a potentially huge audience.  Why do people post intensely personal diaries of their life and why do people want to read them?  Why do people want other people they've never met before to know mundane little details of their daily lives--where they went to eat, what they bought at Target, what song they're listening to while they're writing their entry?  Maybe because these things all say something about the person who is reporting them; they convey some kind of information the writer wants you to acknowledge.  But why do we want to acknowledge this information, to get some brief grasp on how somebody else lives their life, to speculate about what some teenage girl's life is like as with the whole Lonelygirl thing?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In "Othermindedness" Joyce brings up a colleague of his who asked him how he helped his students to make their hypertexts more coherent.  He quotes her, "It is so seductive to write these lyric fragments and link them like music.  Some of the most interesting hypertexts have a sort of senseless but shapeful beauty and play.  I worry that my students will lose their ability to closely or to argue or to theorize, or at least that they won't be as willing to" (page 63).  And then a little further down he talks about how he and this colleague decided that well, maybe this sensless beauty is a new way of making sense that we haven't recognized yet.  I bring all this up because it got me thinking about the wiki.  Does our wiki need to have "coherence" and how would we even define that coherence?  Is our wiki going to be like a hypertext in the sense that the reader's choices make it what it is?  Is the way we're building the wiki and how we're expressing things more important than what we're actually expressing?  What are we even saying in this wiki and why would someone want to read it and what would they get out of it (and what do we get out of writing it)?</p>

It's by Chuck Klosterman, so it's also a bit arrogant but, you know, that's how that goes.   Basically, he's asking why there are no video game critics and what the consquences of having no video game critics might be.  In my head I sort of started drawing some parallels, trying to ask myself what  purpose critics serve and if his same line of questioning could be applied to blogs.<br />
He opens the article by saying that there are still people who don't take video games seriously, and that these are the same people who think newspapers are still going to exist in a few decades.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've stumbled across a few blogs ( <a href="http://www.goldenfiddle.com">goldenfiddle</a> and <a href="http://www.hollywoodtuna.com">hollywoodtuna</a>) that I don't know what to make of yet.  They include links to ridiculous things and commentary but a lot of the time they're just providing comments on how female celebrities look (from a guy's perspective).    A lot of the stuff is pretty sexist, and it's strange to think about how quickly photos and gossip are put up on blogs.  There's something strange about looking at pictures of what some female celebrity wore yesterday and reading about how the dress was see-through or how skanky she looked.  I guess these blogs are providing some kind of service that people desire, like an ability to tear down the popular girls (like Go Fug Yourself), but the sexual tone of these blogs makes them different.  Maybe I'm wondering if I should be more offended by them?  I'm not sure, just some random thoughts.</p>

"If the criminal appears as a nonconformist who is unable to meet the demand of technology that we behave in uniform and continuous patterns, literate man is quite inclined to see others who cannot conform as somewhat pathetic.  Especially the child, the cripple, the woman, and the colored person appear in a world of visual and typographic technology as victims of injustice."  I assume that he's using "pathetic" here in terms of having pity for something in a sort of compassionate way, which is the way he uses it in the paragraph above.</p>
