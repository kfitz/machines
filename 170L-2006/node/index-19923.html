    <div class="content"><p>Well, I have to admit that this was an enjoyable homework assignment. I left my video game habits, modest as they were, in a prior life, so the walk through memory dungeon was quite pleasant. Of course, returning to my old stomping grounds with a critical eye became an experience in itself. I played Zork long ago and far away, and at that point I had painstakingly mapped the terrain and finally bought a strategy guide to get me through a tough section that I cannot remember now, save for vague impressions of fire and ice. </p>
<p>This time around I was more content to wander and observe. I felt far from involved, and I watched my own reactions and the structure of the game much more than the actual play. I wanted to figure the game out, but in a totally different way than I once had. Perhaps this made it difficult to appreciate what the game brought to the table. Before my memory of command truncations and conventions kicked back in (hey, even if you never forget how to ride a bike, you may still wobble a little) I fought with the interface and reached some of the same frustrations that <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/258">night owl</a> did. The game felt clunky, probably as much because of my desire to pick it apart as my familiarity with more immersive environments.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>A fair amount of the theory we've been reading lately about games has attributed a good-sized share of the "immersiveness" of video games to the notion of agency in that we're not being pulled along by the capriciousness of authorial intent, but are rather able to freely explore within the boundaries of the game system.  Having grown up on games with interfaces sophisticated enough, or at least designed well enough to at least project the illusion of transparency, I found the experience of playing Adventure, and to a lesser extent Zork, to be incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>The interface for these games is so incredibly primitive that I did not feel a sense of immersion at all, except for a fleeting 3 minutes or so with Zork where it was all working, and the computer was not mysteriously denying my eminently reasonable requests.  It became easier as I grew somewhat acclimated to the system and what it could and could not do, but every few minutes, I would make what I thought was a common-sense command, and have it rebuffed.  Bang.  Immersion shattered.  For example, during most of my time spent with Adventure, I was being pursued through the damn catacombs by a dwarf who would throw "tiny knives" at me and then retreat whenever he got bored.  I had an axe at the time, so I tried to use it on the little freak.  No dice.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>While this may seem to be something of a regression, I find myself still thinking about certain  aspects of last week's reading.  In particular I am interested in the idea that Stuart Moulthrop raises that games "appeal because they are configurative, offering the chance to manipulate complex systems within continuous loops of intervention..."  Moulthrop's exploration of this topic seems to fall under a more "nuts and bolts" perspective in that he is concerned with the manipulations of the game's rules and the objects in the gameworld (as I understand it).</p>
<p>I remember a game I played years ago, back when I was more into games than I am today.  It was a role-playing game called Fallout, where you created a character and wandered about in a post-apocalyptic wasteland hanging out with mutants, killing things and tipping radioactive two-headed cows (actually this was a configuration that I never pulled off, though I wanted to).  This was before MMORPGs were really big, so creators of these games had to find ways to make the gameworld reactive, which more or less happens as a matter of course in the case of the online games.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Playing with Zork was interesting, to say the least.  I could see the conflict Henry Jenkins describes in "Game Design as Narrative Architecture."  He writes, "Game designers struggle with this balancing act--trying to determine how much plot will create a compelling framework and how much freedom players can enjoy at a local level without totally derailing the larger narrative trajectory.  As inexperienced storytellers, they often fall back on rather mechanical exposition..." (126).  With Zork, I felt the larger narrative framework was derailed...or I couldn't find it.  Like Lulu, I googled (actually, I Wikipediaed) Zork, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  There is no way I could have figured out what I was doing and even get out the trees in the dimly lit forest until Wikipedia gave me simple commands to use.  Even after I found some help sites, I still couldn't figure out what to do.  The most frustrating part was that I felt like I was following strict guidelines that weren't even told to me on how to play the game.  I repeatedly typed in responses (which I thought made sense) that caused the message "I don't understand what you mean" to pop up.  After seeing those over and over, I wanted to scream at the computer.  Yet, oddly enough, the pleasure of typing something that caused a positive reaction or an actual response was rewarding enough to keep me going.  However, eventually the displeasure of seeing that my responses were invalid made me play the trick that KF said user did with Eliza: come up with ridiculous responses in order to mess up the system.  This turned out to be my favorite part, because I felt like I was getting a human answer.  For instance, I was stuck in the forest behind a grating, and I typed "pick up grating," to which Zork replied "You can't be serious."  When I found more grating and typed "jump grating" (again), I got "You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?"  Later, when I found the bird chirping in the tree, I (for kicks, I hope I'm not this violent in real life) typed "kill bird."  Zork responded: "I've known strange people, but attacking a bird?"  Funny stuff.  The amusing part is that enough users must have tried to input these same, weird commands or the creators of Zork suspected that there would be oddballs like me who wanted to push the game's buttons (so to speak) or they wouldn't have created those replies.  It made me want to continue just so I could see where I would get a funny reply and not simply "I don't understand what you mean."</p>

I'm starting to feel this way about a lot of the books we've been reading.  They all talk about the hypertext as the medium of the future, blah blah blah, do so much to make their text seem as if we're experiencing it digitally - but they're all still on paper!  Isn't that sort of undermining their point? </p>
<p> Futhermore, these books are aimed at people who already are immersed in this digital culture, so wouldn't the best way to snag them to read the book be to put it in the forum they already inhabit?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I've been overthinking things for as long as I can remember.  I overthink the fact that I overthink everything.  I analyze absolutely everything and come up with these explanations of why I subconsciously didn't do what I said I was going to do or what someone really meant when they said something to me.  Buying things involves a very complicated process of very, very carefully weighing out all the pros and cons and selecting the exact item I want.  If I don't have enough time to go through this complicated process, it's hard to feel...satisfied. Thinking is good but thinking, hard indulgent thinking, about your life and why this happened and what you would say if you could go back in time and what you should be doing and what other people think about you...it's all f*cking exhausting.  I've been thinking (ha) about why it's so hard for me to write in here sometimes...I find myself thinking about the blog more than ever actually doing things with it.  (And I use too many ...'s).  My complete inability to just do, act, write is kind of a problem.  This blog isn't a place where I could just sit down any day of the week and write about what I'm feeling at that very moment or how someone in a crowd puked, just a little, on my leg last night or how my sister keeps leaving me messages with her cat meowing into the phone followed by a "snufflebunny says hello!" or "emmybemmybear wants to say hi!" comment.  This blog has a strange mix of academic and personal and I can't always figure out what to do.  It's hard for me to write first reactions to material and first thoughts because you always have to be checking yourself-- does this make sense (making sense is obviously not always an easy task), did someone else already say this in a more concise and coherent way, am I going to completely change my mind once I read that article I haven't printed out yet...and then I just get bogged down in it all. I suppose I really just need to get over it.  This is really more of a self-indulgent whining post than a post that "matters" so to speak...Sunday nights get me in a certain mood (the line that always comes to me is from these stories that I used to read when I was little that were about this badger named Frances and her viewpoint of the world..."Homework sits on top of Sunday, squashing Sunday flat")  But yeah, the academic stuff will come later tonight.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The first time I played through Facade, I was thorougly unimpressed.  The characters didn't seem to respond to the things I said, and when they did respond to me, they often completely misinterpreted what I was saying.  At first, I attributed these things to poor programming.  However, as I played through the game again, I realized that the moods of the characters varied significantly between runthroughs.  The underlying tensions were always there, but in some runthroughs they were much more reactive than others, even when little in my behavior changed.  There were some events that, as far as I can tell, were entirely determined by random chance.  This dynamic is, in my mind, what separates Facade from other games or interactive stories.  In Facade, you have some degree of influence over the events, but there are still major plot points that change from version to version for reasons entirely outside of your control.</p>
