    <div class="content"><p>Growing up, i was the kid that hated "Edutainment." Hell, i'm still the kid that hates Edutainment. Reader Rabbit, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, Math Blaster... all those educational products thinly-veiled as "Games" that were "Fun" that my peers and i sat through in our poorly-funded Computer class back when i was wee. An inner-city public school in Brooklyn, New York, there were maybe four of those new-fangled Macintosh computers, single button mice and graphical interfaces, and most of the kids would fight tooth and nail to use them once class started, ooohing and aaahing at icons and the like while an anthropomorphic bunny explained the proper way to say "gopher." Or something. Meanwhile, those who were "in the know" headed straight for the Commodore 64s that populated the rest of the room, in front of whose monochrome screens i spent countless hours trying to get my damn oxen to successfully ford the river, or blasting at rabbits with that pixel o' doom that spat out of the mouth of my rifle. Ah, The Oregon Trail-- i can honestly say i learned far more about technology fumbling around with 5 and 1/4" floppies, and far more about decision making and the like with a draconic UI (user interface... more on that in a sec), plotting the ideal time (April, in my humble opinion) to set out on that perilous journey out West (being hardcore, i was always the farmer). Having developed a rather irrational abhorrence of the Mac OS at a young age, i spent a lot of time roaming around the more affluent neighborhoods (Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, for those w/ some knowledge of Brooklyn's geography)  dumpster-diving for discarded parts until i pieced together my first working PC. Ah DOS: 5 or six lines of commands to accomplish what my Mac owning friends were doing with a single click of their "Mouse" (whatever the hell that was, i decided); i felt like some kind sagacious aristocrat: "Your Mac has a calculator? That's cute. I just wrote a program that can add AND subtract in BASIC. Yeah, i'm a badass." And then of course came my first copy of Windows (pirated, of course. i'm realizing now i've never actually *paid* for a copy of the OS) and my first mouse, and suddenly everything was so much easier! A calculator that could add, subtract, divide, multiply, etc. Microsoft Paint. File menus and folders to keep everything organized et wot, and everything just a click away... i'd stumbled upon some kind of technological Nirvana, in 256 colors no less. Gone somewhat was that feeling of being some kind of Golden God, but at least the whole "keeping up with the Joneses" didn't mean succumbing to the beast that was Apple. </p>
<p>Time passed, and my feelings on the whole Mac vs PC debate intensified. Owning a PC became a badge of honor, simply because they were so much trickier to deal with. The steep learning curve meant a few of us computer-savvy elite could pat ourselves on the back over our various forays in Visual C++ or pirating via mIRC whilst our Mac brethren clicked on their ever fancier buttons and etc. While kids bragged about their new Macs--which i (to this day) refer to as Fisher Price "My First PCs," my buddies and i compared specs and charts for our new dream rigs: "128 megs of Ram!?! A 40 gig hard drive!?! You are so cool." But they had Photoshop. Damn. No matter, we got Photoshop eventually. Macs got prettier and prettier, but PCs were the place for the "real" Power-Users to be, we as gamers and pirates,  coding in C++ and HTML and whatever else struck our fancy. While they were enjoying a simple yet serene computing experience, we were smug with our ginourmous rigs with at least one side of the case lying on the floor somewhere, table fans blowing inside them to keep the temperature at a reasonable level. And then something sort of changed with Windows 98 / ME / 2000 / XP. Where's my Command Prompt? Why can't i boot into DOS anymore? What the hell is this damn talking paperclip doing in Office, and how the hell do i get rid of him? And no, i don't want to send an error report to Microsoft, seeing as how i didn't technically buy this copy of Windows. Things got... well, simpler. User-Friendly. Suddenly, the only surface difference between a Mac and PC (besides the price tag and the UI) was that Windows crashed a hell of a lot more often. i had to work harder to tweak windows. Sure, we got all the games and a few more open-source alternatives (open-source being the new sign of cool) but... Macs for a moment or two were just... you know, more convenient. Two competing operating systems (to say nothing of *nix, FreeBSD and the like... open source makes my head hurt) means a dramatically different experience, at least for me. For example: my mouse has 6 buttons. My friend's MacBook has one. Trying to use his laptop to simply copy a few folders onto a portable hard drive invoked images of a chimp with a rock trying to make a cappuccino. So i gave up. And yet, the future is here: Windows Vista and... whatever the latest iteration of the Mac OS is, will be arriving in 2007 (ostensibly) and if there's one thing i've noticed it's that they're... well, pretty. Alarmingly so. I hear talk of three-dimensional whatchamacallits and drag and drop everything and etc. And then prototype interfaces, like those pseudoanonymity posted up on the blog. Desktops that flip around? Dragging and tossing my files around? What the hell? It looks cool but... I'm reminded of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report,</a> specifically the scene where Tom Cruise is wearing those funky gloves and dragging stuff around. Aside from the "wow" factor i can see no practical application for such interfaces, except possibly the most important one: My dog could figure that out. That is to say, when using a computer becomes so intuitive that anyone can do it, what happens when everyone starts to do it? </p>
<p>There's a point in there, somewhere. Think Franciscan monks, devoting X amount of time to copying a book so that there'd be another copy. Limited access. With the printing press, suddenly everyone with a bit of spending money and an education can read. Public education comes, and you don't even have to be rich! People are writing, contributing, Culture flourishes. With the advent of the "Information Age" (are we allowed to call it that yet?) we see "Big Media" suddenly having to contend with Average Joe in Mom's basement spouting criticism that people notice, or Average Jane and her video camera posting a vid to her website and getting great footage a larger News Corp could never really broadcast without getting heat from the powers that be. But there's still that last hurdle: Computers for the most part are still fickle creatures, requiring lots of coddling and tinkering at times, code and the like as the final barrier. What happens when content can be created and distributed by literally anyone (barring DRM, "The Man's" encroachment, etc)? What happens when--once again-- using a computer is no longer an arcane practice for the diligent and devoted? Are all of us closet-nerds going to have to get out of our closets? Am i going to start having to hunt for FAQs on Linux, just to feel like i'm on the bleeding edge again? Just to feel like a badass again?</p>
<p>Hrmm. This rant feels related.</p>
