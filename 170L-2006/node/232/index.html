    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://soulkerfuffle.blogspot.com/2006/10/view-from-top.html">Found via Slashdot,</a> it's a guest blog on someone's site, about a member of the World of Warcraft elite who's hanging up his... err... cloak? Axe? </p>
<p>Kind of wish this blog had an Anonymous Coward option, but here goes: My name is GrumpyMutt, and i'm an addict. </p>
<p>That being said, I get the feeling i'm doing alright. For those who won't bother to RTFA (slashdot-speak for Read The Fucking Article) the ex-Wow player goes on at length about the hazards of playing the incredibly popular MMORPG, talking about weight gain and skipping work / class and ruined relationships and etc. The comments that follow are also... intriguing, as a debate ensues (takes place on the slashdot site too) as to whether or not a video game addiction can be compared to a drug addiction. Umm... yeah. So i don't play WoW. I've tried it, and to be honest, i got bored really quickly. But it does get me thinking: Hey, this is a lot like Diablo 2 (coincidentally, also made by Blizzard), except with more players. And updated graphics. And the Warcraft theme. And you've got to pay to play it. And then i thought back to Diablo 2... </p>
<p>I've got a pretty healthy social life. I live in a lawry suite with fellow ne'er do wells, and our ideas of a "good time" are the stereotypical college ones, ie: throwing parties where the booze flows like wine with loud music and dancing and the like. For fall break, we camped for a day or so and partied and etc. And then decided as a group to spend the last two days of fall break grinding through Diablo 2. And by grinding, i mean two 9-10 hour sessions, with interruptions only for the walk to Frary to mingle with the rest of the campus, as if to hide our shame. But then we were back at it, 4:30 in the morning rolls around and we're chatting in-game (the shouting to each other's rooms died out around 2am) wondering what the hell time it was. Parties raged on the floors and suites around us, yet we only left our rooms to walk down the hall to get a bit of clarification on our battleplans "okay, druid's got to swarm with those wolves, we need the meat shield. Paladin should freeze, and i'll keep cursing and barb should  frenzy." And we referred to each other by our ingame handles, which was... kind of weird, in retrospect. </p>
<p>We talked in class today about immersion, and games just being games, the debate between Cyberdrama and Ludology... I personally am in a bit of a weird boat with that one. For all intents and purposes, Diablo 2 is all about one thing, clicking. Oh, and the scroll wheel. Click over there, click click click that monster thing, click to pick up the loot, rinse and repeat. Scroll a bit to pick a new skill and click some more. And yet it's so much more... There's the Counter-Strike-esque immersion, when i ignored my good friend as he came to sit in my room because we were in the middle of a rather large horde of monsters. And then there's the narrative-tied immersion, sitting around our common room with a celebratory bottle of champagne after we'd beaten the game (and expansion pack) and traded knowledge of Diablo 2 lore. Lore, because there is in fact a rather lengthy history behind the games--Diablo 2 was one of those games that, like Starcraft, came with a thick manual containing the game's narrative and such. Not to mention it's relation to the first game, which we had of course all played-through at least a dozen times in our youth.</p>
<p>Immersion, EndGames, lives being sucked away... won't bother tackling them all. I'm interested in interactions: interactions between player and game, interactions between players and other players, interactions between players and society at large... Friends that're genuinely nice people, who become camping, smack-talking asshats when you fire up counter-strike and give them a mouse. That disgusted look people get when you say "i'm gonna go play videogames" instead of going to whatever CCLA event, but tell them it's old-school super nintendo Mario Kart and they make it back to your room before you do. Social stigmas (gamers are losers who sit in dimly lit rooms and fantasize about killing people all day) and the reality (interesting, "socially-successful" [whatever the hell that means] guys and girls who're plenty sociable and like to occasionally... sit in dimly lit rooms killing stuff). The post about WoW, and most stigma attached to video games, seems to be related to addicted personalities and the idea that if you're staring at a screen, you're not interacting, living a lie, etc. Escapism...</p>
<p>Well, hell. It is all about Escapism. I regularly see people being chastised for watching their good friends play a video game like mario kart or something... yet Sunday Night Football is a revered American tradition, nevermind that it's  thousands of people sitting around a television screen watching people who don't even know they exist grunt and charge. And somehow saying "I play counter-strike for the same reason you play soccer" doesn't cut it, because soccer is fun and exercise and counter-strike is stupid. MMOs are a whole new breed of animal. I do in fact play an MMO (gasp!), and while i'm not foaming at the mouth when i'm not logged in and playing, i'm genuinely aware of the absurd amount of time that's taken up by it. It's called Eve-Online, google it if you want. It's based around a sci-fi premise, the human race scattered across the universe and then interacting with one another, no aliens. I was drawn to it despite a vehement hatred of MMOs specifically because of player interactions. It's far smaller than WoW's 7million subscriber mark, but whereas WoW is divided into several servers (different instances of the same world, so Bob on Server A won't ever run into Cindy on Server J), Eve exists as one undivded "world;" this in turn means everyone's always interacting with everyone else. Which brings up interesting consequences. For one, the game's economy is completely player-driven: Just about everything that can be fitted to your ship, the ships themselves, ammunition and equipment, etc, is created by a player, who then assigns a price, and throws it onto the market hoping for a buyer. It's infinitely more complex than that however. As an example, in the "real" world i'm (ostensibly) an english major, graduating soon and more than likely on my way to the 9-5 grind. In Eve, i'm CEO of a small but successful corporation with a net-worth of over a billion in game currency, a hefty sum for such a small organization. I've never taken an economics class, and absolutely detest numbers, but not only do I know what a Donchian Channel is, monitoring such figures and keeping track of formulas (there're several excel spreadsheets on my desktop... yes, for a "video game") is absolutely essential to our survival in a rather brutal and unforgiving marketplace. In fact, the second i finish rambling on this post, i need to log in, as today is pay-day and one of my partners (25 year old male accountant from Germany) uses bank "holidays" (i think he means days off) to calculate weekly profits so we can distribute paychecks to our employees based on gains or losses in our net worth. There's a point in there...  In this virtual world, decisions i make, in conjunction discussion with other members of this virtual world, can have dramatic effects. Yesterday we flooded one market with a certain type of mineral and watched with glee as prices plummeted around the region, conversely affecting starship prices, allowing us to scoop up several battleships at a steal, which we'll need to stave off player-pirates who've been hassling our miners. I think that's cool. If i told my friends i was doing that, and not that i was working on various reading responses (which i happened to be doing at the same time), somehow i'd be less... i dunno, cool. Our perception of those who appreciate a certain kind of immersion coloring our interactions with them. Meth addicts hide their pipes when someone knocks at the door, i minimize my MMO client. </p>
<p>Also, after getting out of class today I walked to the Coop, ordered a sandwich to take back home, and spent the interim period playing those arcade games at the back, specifically the airplane shooter. Just thought i'd... throw that out there.</p>
