    <div class="content"><p>It's been a bit since the heavy blog on blog discussion we had when we first started back in September. But our discussion on voyeurism and other events have made me think about the blog/reality issue again.<br />
I'm not sure how to clarify what I'm saying, but a couple of things have happened in the last week that made me feel uncomfortable with blogs.</p>
<p>The Tiny Cat Pants Tale- I read the aforementioned blog (it's linked on the right side of our own blog) regularly now because I enjoy Aunt B's sassy wit and frankness on personal stuff. So I knew she was coming to L.A. because she had been blogging about it. For a second, I thought "hmm, it would be cool to see her in person." But it was one of those throw-away thoughts, because why would she meet with someone who reads her blog, but she has no interaction with? How uncomfortable. THEN a post in Tiny Pants appears about Claremont, to which I thought "what a coincidence." This is followed by a Tiny Pants post about none other then KF who DID have dinner with her. Of course, this is followed with a post by KF about Aunt B. There was just too much reality interfering with my blogging experience. I felt mildly creepy, like I was listening in on two people's conversation without their knowing. Yes, the blogs are posted on the Internet and certainly not in a secretive way (you can get to both blogs through links from Writing Machines), but because I don't have my own engaging, intelligent blog, I feel like I have no business playing in their world. </p>
<p>The Incident of the Other Pomona Professor with a Blog- I also read another blog written by a Pomona English professor because it's sassy as well. But now that I'm actually taking a class with the professor, it's a somewhat unnerving experience. Last week the professor had office hours, which I attended because I wanted extra help. A few days later, a post appears about wishing that there was a button you could press to get rid of students (and colleagues!) taking up too much time in the office. She definitely has a point, but I feel very self-conscious now about asking for help and wondering if I'm one of those students who would have been buttoned. Now I wasn't living with the illusion that professors are dying to have us come in and complain and ask silly questions, but in order to smooth over the rough patches, I like to suspend reality on some occasions. Now the blog has burst that bubbleâ€¦</p>
<p>I feel like I just wasted a lot of words essentially saying, "I feel strange about blogs," which certainly isn't a profound realization for this class. But there you goâ€¦</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I know exactly what you're talking about.  Some of my friends have blogs and I can't stand reading them.  Their blog-self tends to contrast sharply with how I view them as a person, and trying to reconcile the two is somehow a very difficult and uncomfortable process.  </p>
<p>There definitely is such a thing as too much information, and in the case of friend's blogs that's how I feel.  I can't read them with the same carefree perspective that I read Dooce or Tiny Cat Pants.  I'm invested  because I know them personally, and it's work to try to figure out how I fit into (or am completely absent from) what their blogging about, much like your experience reading about this professor's desire to get rid of students during office hours.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by tophat1 on 30 October 2006 - 6:53pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I completely understand the professor blog concern and I think that Shock and Awe makes an important distinction between reading the blogs of people we know and reading the blogs of strangers.  </p>
<p>My intuition is that it is almost unfair that professors blog about students because it's highly likely that one of their students will read the blog.  It would be particularly unnerving if they blogged about particular students.  Even if they omit names, it wouldn't be hard to tell if they were blogging about you.  Maybe certain types of blogs are inappropriate or, at the very least, disconcerting.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Pimm on 30 October 2006 - 7:17pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>One the difficulties yet greatest parts of reading is the ability for different interpretations.  Often the reader interprets words completely differently than the writer intends, and this is great because it allows for different interpretations and conversations about the writer's meaning.  But, in terms of personal pieces, either in a blog or elsewhere, this is tricky.  Who knows what kind of a day or what type of mood the professor was in when he/she wrote that?  I agree that certain things shouldn't be put on the web precisely because people who know the writer can extract unintended meanings.  Or intended, for that matter.  A number of my friends and I have been personally hurt by the words of other's on the web through livejournal or blogs.  So I'm not sure what to think...I guess the person posting has to realize that what he/she writes might be read by people he knows and that readers may take comments personally when they aren't meant to be or may walk away with a meaning that wasn't intended.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 30 October 2006 - 8:06pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I keep rewriting this comment, which I guess goes to show how much I'm interested by the ideas in your post.</p>
<p>I remember reading "You've Got Blog" in the begining of the year--do you remember their definition of a blog?  It was rather general--a webpage updated semi-regularly with the newest material at the top.  But it quickly became clear that this wasn't perhaps the best definiton--a blog was often really some sort of public diary.  It was founded on an intensely voyeuristic desire, inspire of all of the pretensions of "filtering", etc.  Just recall the speculation about Meg and Jason and their potential romance that went on in the communities reading their blogs.  If we weren't really looking into people's lives, what would their interest be?  A blog sells a persons life--it is, in some way, something of a personality contest.  </p>
<p>I need to shut up, but first I'm going to offer this anecdote I stumbled upon recently--it's from an intereview with Ayelet Waldman, a blogger, who, while suffering from post-partum depression, posted a thinly veiled meditation on suicide on her blog.  The response was immediate:</p>
<p>"I got this outpouring of support from the comments.  It was three in the morning, and a friend of mine in Israel saw the blog and kept calling until I picked up the phone and she said, 'You need to call your shrink, something's going on.'  She essentially saved me that moment.  And that's when I thought, thank God I wrote the post instead of doing something else.  I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't had the blog, but I focused all this energy on my log and I alerted people that I was crying out for help.  That morning I called my psychiatrist and one pill and one hour later I was fine."</p>
<p>OK--so, extreme example.  But the personal, diaristic nature of the web blog can obviously be a strength.  And while sometimes it hurts--while sometimes a bit of conscentiousness for the audience would be in order--if one does away with that personal aspect, one risks losing both what makes blogs interesting and what makes them essential.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Good points, marmalade.  I think I'm revising some of my thoughts thanks to you.  As you point out, if bloggers weren't so open and personal, then people wouldn't read what they wrote.  Plus the power these personal, online accounts have on readers (both who know and don't know the blogger) is seen through the readers' strong reactions to them.  It sounds like I'm writing a slogan to go on a poster promoting reading for children, but I think it's true: words have power, and personal blogs are a good example of this.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-481" class="active">Like Shock and Awe said,</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Lulu on 31 October 2006 - 1:42am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Like Shock and Awe said, sometimes there is a very clear distinction between a person's blog-self and their human-self, even though they're the same person.  In my experience, I've been very surprised when reading what exactly is going on in my friends' heads in their blogs.  It's often awkward to talk to them in "real life" about what they wrote in their blogs, and sometimes it almost seems like in most cases the two entities must remain separate lest one wants to experience extreme awkwardness.</p>
<p>Also, on the issue of "interfering" in strangers' blogs, I've heard many funny and awkward stories regarding this.  I've had friends tell me, "Yesterday, some random kid came up to me and asked me about something I wrote in my blog!"  There is definitely a feeling that the outsider is invading on another's personal space, but I feel like even though that particular situation is awkward, the blogger should accept that by choosing to write on the internet, they are willingly exhibiting themselves and their lives as public.  When I write in my other blog, I write with the knowledge that other people can and probably will run across it, and therefore there's this process of saying things in a half-censored manner.  </p>
<p>Then again, there's also a privacy feature in most blogs, and I think your Other Pomona Professor with a Blog should privatize his or her entries or just not say such things in public.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>While I don't imagine blog etiquette in academia has been set in stone -- and probably just as well -- it seems to me that your prof committed a serious faux pas by complaining about having to help students. It would be so in almost any other context. I wonder whether the issue is about blog form itself or what appears to me a distinct misuse of it.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Now I feel a bit bad about what I said about the professor. I think her post was justified, it wasn't so much complaining as venting. I just am not sure if it's appropriate for my eyes. Sort of a tricky situation. Perhaps I shouldn't poke around in places where I might not like what I see. I'm not sure. I have conflicted feelings, I suppose.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I guess as a blogger, I'm inclined to think that it's the reader's choice whether or not to "poke around," and therefore their responsibility if they stumble upon something they don't like (especially in blogs that at least try to be anonymous--i.e. that don't display the person's real name).</p>
<p>Then again, my blog is not anonymous, and I don't write about work, soo. But this sort of stuff comes up anyway, with people misreading things and getting upset, or whatever, and I just tell them that if they're having problems, they can just not read it.</p>
<p>But that is (from experience) not the best way to deal with the problem. I haven't found a better one, though. (I guess actual communication could help, but uh, I don't really do that.)</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by black lace on 3 November 2006 - 12:53am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>and being a reader of that same professor's blog, I think, given what said professor said, part of it was an issue of the sheer volume of people flowing through the door.  And I think a lot of it was wanting to share the concept of the excuse button machine.  Because, come on, we all have days when there's someone, or a very long stream of someones, who just keep wandering by and they never end!</p>
<p>And my two cents, being someone who will, at times, vent about co-workers, superiors, and friends-- I use my lj to keep friends from home, at school, and chosen family in LA, updated on what's happening in my life, to grow seeds of thoughts boucing about my head and get other's input, and generally have a sense of social interaction with all these people who i like having in my life, but don't have the time to commit to spending physical or vocal time with each.  And it's a much more comfortabe medium for me than newsletter-like emails.  </p>
<p>What I'm getting to is my lj is, at times, what you would get from me if you talked to me in person at a quick point when I'm in a particular flash of some emotional state, or having a particular thought i really want to share.  It's a way of venting tiny little frustrations, or airing weird chance thoughts, and feeling more connected to others.  And often trying to amuse, or at least engage.  Yes, one needs to be careful talking about real life people, especially work-oriented people (I tend to use first name initial, or stange little epithets, and be vague about the exact circumstance, emailing or talking to those who want details).  One of the features I really like about lj is the ability to lock a post so only certain people can see it (not perfect scurity, but helpful), which I will use in geographic groups when I really need to let bile loose about someone, and there isn't someone I can talk to in person.</p>
<p>But off-hand little irks?  Everybody has those.  And everybody needs to express them from time to time.  If you can put an amusing spin on them why not in a public forum of friends (and if you're reading someone's blog, there's some sort of a "friend" mutation going on)?  My opinion, if you're not naming names, your not giving details that could lead to a specific individual, and you're not being malicious, it's your personal journal, go for it.  Saying profs can't be aggrevated in their own personal blogs kinda strikes me as a continuation of the myth that they pull pillows out of their filing cabinets and night and curl up for bed under their desks.</p>
