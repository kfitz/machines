    <div class="content"><p>I came across this <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9075-2430810,00.html">article</a> today proclaiming that Google just purchased Jotspot, one of the wiki sites KF recommended I look into as a forum for a final project.  The lead of the article states that this was the latest step in Google's "designs on the web 2.0 market."  I don't know exactly what this means, but it sounds like Google is trying to monopolize the programs it thinks will be influential in the next generation of web interaction.</p>
<p>Joe Krauss, the co-founder of Jotspot, was excited by the deal. "We watched them acquire Writely, and launch Google Groups, Google Spreadsheets and Google Apps for Your Domain. It was pretty apparent that Google shared our vision for how groups of people can create, manage and share information online," he said. While it is apparent that Google can use it's resources to increase the usefulness and availability of programs, I'm not sure I'm so excited by the prospect of a Google monopoly over the web 2.0 market.  Part of it is my old-fashioned fear of any kind of monopoly, but I also think it could lead to an over-centralization and homogenization of web resources.  I'd be curious to hear what the more tech-savvy among you think.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I feel like I'm becoming an internet stalker.  When I was looking up information on "Kind of Blue's" author, Scott Rettberg, I saw that he received his PhD from the University of Cincinnati.  I'm from Cincinnati, and although I don't love my city, I get oddly excited when I hear others mention it, so I decided to pursue him.  I found a link to his <a href="http://retts.net/">blog</a>, and from there the stalking began.  There was a link below to a site called "Jill" and, lo and behold, it was <a href="http://jilltxt.net/">Jill Walker's</a>.  From looking at the sites, and his intrigued me in particular, you can read how they teach at the same university and about their adventures traveling to, say, a Turkish bath.  Or you can scroll through his photos, posted on Flickr.  That's right, you can see pictures of his dog, his vacations, his family on Christmas.  Or you can look through an album of 10 photos of Jill, which has the heading "This set is mostly for me. Sometimes I want to see my girl."  That didn't stop me from looking.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I just got finished reading the <cite>Ballad of Sand and Harry Soot</cite>.</p>
<p>And I just don't know quite what to make of it yet.  I should perhaps preface this all by saying that I'm not much of a poetry person.  I should also admit that it took me most of the poem to figure out the (somewhat obvious point) that it was about silicon (sand) vs. carbon (soot).  </p>
<p>And while it was frustrating (but then, again, I find most poetry frustrating), I think I liked it.</p>
<p>I'm struggling to say exactly what it was that I liked.  I think it had to do with the pictures (perhaps I am very lame).  </p>
<p>The pictures somehow unified it--and they matched the text so well--particularly the Sisyphus project images of the ball swirling the sand.  Indeed, it seemed as if the text could have been written for the pictures rather than the other way around.  The text is so abstract (at least to me), that having the images there somehow gave me a grasp on what sort of emotions or relationships or -- drives?... were being discussed in that moment.  I would say the pictures were just as much a part of my "understanding" of the poem as the text.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>We talked in class today about the format of "Kind of Blue" and whether it can be reproduced in print form or whether the story relies on its email/internet form for meaning.  From what I gathered, some people believed its email style could be transferred to an epistolary print novel, especially since the fake in-box doesn't quite make sense in that all of the emails--no matter the recipient--are in the same in-box.  Others seemed to like the online style, and I agree.  I tried to think of what ways that this story might rely on its medium and form, and one thing that came to mind is its promiscuity.</p>

<p>For example, if I found a news article about an unidentied body mysteriously discovered in a Louisiana swamp, could I write a mystery in which that is the body of the victim and link to that article as part of the evidence?</p>
<p>Another example, if I found a particularly hilarious picture of a super wild party somewhere, could I link to it as a photo of a party I describe in a story?  To go more extreme, could I state that some of the people at the party are specific characters in my text?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Perhaps it's a bit unusual to write a blog with the purpose of asking a question about a definition, but I'm going to do it: What exactly is voyeurism?  What's crucial to understanding it?  I was confused in class when we talked about it, but I was too embarrassed to ask.  However, looking at even recent posts on the blog that use the term make me realize that I am still confused, and I'm not sure if my definition differs from others'.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism">voyeurism</a> is "a practice in which an individual derives sexual pleasure from observing other people."  Other definitions I've found seem a bit unclear on how sex is involved; is it necessary in voyeurism for the viewer to derive sexual pleasure, or can he/she just watch a sexual act?</p>

We talked about how our feelings in a novel are similar or different (according to our individual perspectives).  Finally, we discussed our different feelings of voyeurism regarding the different texts.  First off, I think that there is a different interaction between reader and novel and reader and electronic text. We aren't factored into the novel at all, at least not in any literal way and we certainly aren't going to change the ending according to our action or inaction.  At least in some electronic texts we are able to change the outcome according to our choices (even if they aren't especially informed choices).</p>

    <div class="content"><p>It's been a bit since the heavy blog on blog discussion we had when we first started back in September. But our discussion on voyeurism and other events have made me think about the blog/reality issue again.<br />
I'm not sure how to clarify what I'm saying, but a couple of things have happened in the last week that made me feel uncomfortable with blogs.</p>
<p>The Tiny Cat Pants Tale- I read the aforementioned blog (it's linked on the right side of our own blog) regularly now because I enjoy Aunt B's sassy wit and frankness on personal stuff. So I knew she was coming to L.A. because she had been blogging about it. For a second, I thought "hmm, it would be cool to see her in person." But it was one of those throw-away thoughts, because why would she meet with someone who reads her blog, but she has no interaction with? How uncomfortable. THEN a post in Tiny Pants appears about Claremont, to which I thought "what a coincidence." This is followed by a Tiny Pants post about none other then KF who DID have dinner with her. Of course, this is followed with a post by KF about Aunt B. There was just too much reality interfering with my blogging experience. I felt mildly creepy, like I was listening in on two people's conversation without their knowing. Yes, the blogs are posted on the Internet and certainly not in a secretive way (you can get to both blogs through links from Writing Machines), but because I don't have my own engaging, intelligent blog, I feel like I have no business playing in their world.</p>
