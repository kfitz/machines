    <div class="content"><p>Several people have offered confessions of one sort or another on our blog, including <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/232">Grumpymutt's confession</a> that he really enjoys playing video- and computer games, <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/234">marmalade's confession</a> that she is addicted to reading the New Yorker, and <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/236">Shock and Awe's confession</a> that he had never really thought about videogames from an academic perspective until the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Well, I have my own confession to make: I am not competitive.  And I worry about this because it's a stereotypically female trait.  Perhaps I should clarify: I <em>am</em> competitive about some things; I strive to do well at things I enjoy or I think are important.  But there is a difference between competition and diligence, and although I am regularly diligent, I rarely feel that that diligence is of a competitive nature-- and if it is, then it's more of a competition-against-what-I'm-capable-of-doing-type thing.</p>
<p>I suppose one could make the argument that gaming is also a competition with oneself, with one's potential.  But it still seems different to me.  Maybe that's just my anti-game bias.</p>
<p>But back to the non-competitive thing: it's making me feel a little lost in class and blog discussions, because not only do I have few personal experiences with gaming to draw from, but many of the games that others have played and describe often sound boring and pointless to me.  Which is why I'm excited about Facade-- because it seems like something (unlike shooting people, blowing up things, running football plays, etc.) that I might be able to be interested in.  But this worries me, because it seems that liking Facade is such an obviously female thing to do.  (Granted, The Sims is similar to Facade with regard to the actions it requires on the part of the gamer, and The Sims seems to be a fairly gender-neutral game.)  Now, several years ago, I stopped taking it upon myself to personally contradict with my own behavior every stereotype about women, but it still pisses me off when I find myself acting in stereotypical ways, or thinking stereotypically female things-- even when those are my actual, genuine thoughts.</p>
<p>I don't want those of you who like gaming to be offended by my description of some of the games you play as "boring and pointless."  It may sound like a rehashing of the old biases against games, but it also happens to be my own gut reaction.  And I wish that I <strong>did</strong> like shoot-'em-up games; then I wouldn't feel like a walking cliche.  I know women who like playing games, electronic and otherwise, and I certainly don't mean to marginalize them-- in fact, I kind of envy them.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm attempting to say here is that I feel like gender is a white elephant in the room in our discussions about gaming, and I wanted to make it a visible elephant so that we can maybe get some dialogue going about it (although I realize that everyone will have to tread very carefully...)</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 20 October 2006 - 1:09pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I sort of tried to <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/153">pose this question</a> a bit earlier, too, and no one seemed ready to jump on the bandwagon, then... But, as long as the band is tuned up now, let's go for it!  ;)  </p>
<p>But yes, I think there is obviously a gender component.  </p>
<p><a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/239">Pimm</a> has shared some of her ideas about the competition part of this--the ability to compete in sports but not in killing scenarios, etc.  I wonder how much her ideas of athleticism are tied into your ideas of diligence?  A lack of success somehow reflecting a lack of appropriate preparation?  I know that as a competitive runner, I hate being passed in races, and it's even worse when I'm in sight of the finish line.  And, believe it or not, I've elbowed my fair share of girls into trees and bushes(!).  But neither my feelings of defeat nor my aggressive actions have been out of anger or out of lust to win (usually), but rather out of a feeling that I'm being prevented/not achieving what I am capable of...  That all my preparation is being negated by not running the race for which I spent the past months preparing...</p>
<p>Going further, maybe we can explain women's athletic competitiveness with the observation that sports are often not very high-tech.  At least for me, when I'm out running there's just me, my stopwatch, and my shoes.  Sport's can be quite easily reduced to a person-to-person or person-to-self competition.  There isn't really any mediation going on--unless you want to count my shoes as a medium (hmm... that's an interesting idea...!).  So, thinking about this, I wonder if there's not maybe a technology factor?  The whole nifty-gadget thing?  Men find it easier to become interested in what you describe as "pointless", shoot-em-up competitions because of the technology mediating the event?  I don't know, maybe that's a red-herring as well.  </p>
<p>However, maybe this goes further than "boys with toys," too.  Maybe it has something to do with the math/science vs. humanities divide that's particularly gender-ified--namely, men are more interested in technology (as can be represented in games, computers, nintendos) than women.  This, then, eventually leads to the question of whether there are innate differences between women and men in the ways that they think.  There is some evidence that there are inherent differences between sexes; there is also a huge, acknowledged acculturation component.  But it's still a question that's very much up for grabs.  </p>
<p>Anyway, some of this (I willingly acknowledge) is a lot of crap.  I mean, all video games are not nifty gadgets; all men are not my dad (who has given up all holiday familial interactions for the past two years and spent Christmas underneath the couch, trying to fix various switches on his model train set); there are plenty of very tech-savvy women.   But maybe (hopefully) it exposes bit more of that elephant...?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Thanks for your musings, marmalade.  And I'm sorry if it seemed as if I was giving short shrift to your previous post.  I hadn't remembered it in relation to games because I had filed it away in my mental "Memmott" file, not my "games" file.  Oh, the human brain...</p>
<p>Your idea of the technology/mediation itself perhaps being important is very interesting.  I will have to chew on it a little...</p>
