    <div class="content"><p>When I was reading Hayles's "Writing Machines," I couldn't help but feel skeptical about...well, to be brutally honest, the entire point.  I actually agreed with and was sympathetic to a lot of Hayles' points about media ecology, the bathtub theory of literature, and the continual evolution and enhancement of books alongside the progression of electronic literature.  In fact, I really loved when she said "as we work toward critical practices and theories appropriate for electronic literature, we may come to renewed appreciation for the specificity of print." (33)  However, despite all these great points that I could sympathize with, I was also skeptical about a lot of things, and in particular her analysis of electronic literature like "Lexia to Perplexia."  I'm not critical as to the actual content or analysis.  Instead, I guess my discomfort stems from a lack of clarity as to who the audience is, and the actual value of literary criticism.  So, I guess this entry isn't just a straightforward critique of an assigned reading.  It's more a pondering of why I am reading what I'm reading and the usefulness of what I'm learning. </p>
<p>First of all, the question of audience.  She's addressing a small community of bloggers and electronic lit colleagues.  If this community is genuinely interested in expanding itself and bringing more people into the world of electronic literature (which I hope is the case), I do not think that the critical material (especially critical analyses like her piece on "Lexia to Perplexia") will bring in people.  The writing is good, but the constant use of "neologisms" is often alienating, intimidating, unaccessible, and generally unhelpful in broadening the readership base. I understand that since we are working in a new field, then there's probably a necessity in creating new words that are appropriate for the discipline.  The bad part, though, is that it really creates a "for us, by us" environment.    </p>
<p>Second, I'm ambivalent as to the value of forcibly carving out meaning for the sole sake of intellectual stimulation.  This addresses the value of literary criticism.  As I'm reading Hayles' analysis of "Lexia to Perplexia" and other works, I am wondering why it is that I do not understand so many of the words that I am reading; words such as "remotional," "intertimacy," and "metastrophe."  It's not that I'm not giving the content a chance.  I have definitely read and processed the information.  Even so, reading such literary critique, as well as a ton of other critical texts during my last 3 years at Pomona, has made me constantly judge the relative importance and value of such an intellectual exercise. On the one hand, I'll admit that I really love literature and I get a kick out of reading, writing, criticizing, and learning.  Then again, I start thinking about praxis, that dynamic intersection of theory and practice.  And so, when I do start thinking about praxis, I really start questioning the social value or usefulness of pretty much everything I learn. </p>
<p>Reading "Writing Machines" has been simultaneously satisfying and disconcerting for me.  When I merely immersed myself in Hayles's work, I could put myself on an intellectual plane with her ideas.  When I looked at the bigger picture, however, I realized that this text is an example of the type of literature that makes me really critical of academia--its overuse of academic terms, abstract concepts that generally don't click with the average reader, and heavy reliance on theory.  This seems problematic to me. Of course, I'm also complicit in this crime since I'm sitting here, typing what seems to also be a pretty academic response to an academic piece.  I'm not sure how to escape from this catch-22.  Am I being totally self-contradictory?  How can I simultaneousy like what I'm reading yet also be so critical about its inherent academic and social value?  And how do I break out of this cycle of using academic jargon to critique other academic jargon?  Is it unfortunate that the only way I know how to critique theory is by using the same language that I'm so critical of?  Does this all matter in the end? Where is education in elite institutions headed if so much of it is disconnected with the real world?  </p>
<p>One thing, though, that I am glad for is the fact that reading criticism in college has allowed me to appreciate the simplicity of childhood fiction.  No intellectual baggage or frills.  </p>
<p>But overall, I'm still so confused.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by silversprung on 9 October 2006 - 5:56pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I'm glad that you brought up these issues-- they're all valid and have been on my mind a lot during the past 6 months or so, and contribute in large part to why I decided not to write a thesis.  (But that's a different story altogether...)</p>
<p>I don't think all is lost, though.  I mean, Lexia to Perplexia is an extreme example of electronic writing as inaccessible, but I think that much of what we've been reading in this class is, although unconventional in form or medium, actually more easily accessed by the 'average person' than what we read in a great books class or other class that does parts of the canon.</p>
<p>And I found Hayles' book a lot more straightforward than the text she was discussing (i.e. LtP.)  It certainly effectively performed the function of clarifying for me the issues in the text I had just read.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the lingo can be confusing and alienating.  But here, you kind of answer your own objection-- new terms are needed to discuss a new kind of writing.  And some of them (for me, 'remediation' falls within this category) are actually quite helpful in describing the new stuff that's going on.</p>
<p>You write, "I'm ambivalent as to the value of forcibly carving out meaning for the sole sake of intellectual stimulation."  But I don't think this is the case with regard to our study of electronic writing as a whole (although it may ring truer for LtP.)  It seems to me that what happened (pardon the vast oversimplification) is that people just started writing things on computers and then on the web, and this phenomenon had enough influence in our lives (especially for a practice/phenomenon so young) and enough connections to and breaks from our past experience with literature that some thinkers decided they would try to figure out what was going on.  Granted, some of the writers were also thinkers, and they thought about what other thinkers would say as they were writing-- but the phenomenon of electronic writing itself seems, on the whole, more democratic than you're giving it credit for.</p>
<p>p.s. I hate to intrude on your fond memories of children's fiction, but those books, too, are subject to lit crit scrutiny-- witness the ID1 class that Oona Eisenstadt teaches on children's lit.  (Actually, though, I think we can still all enjoy our memories of childhood reading even with this recognition that there are complicated issues in those texts, too.)</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-328" class="active">Perhaps I am misinterpreting</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 10 October 2006 - 11:55am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Perhaps I am misinterpreting what Lulu had to say, but I feel as though the criticism of "forcibly carving out meaning for the sole sake of intellectual stimulation" has to do with the theoretical rather than the practical side of electronic fiction.  By which I mean, not having to do with people finding computers and finding that they could write on computers--I agree that this was a somewhat natural and organic process--but rather the process of taking this electronic writing (written in a new media, constructed in a new way) and performing a sort of self-aggrandizing analysis upon it--congratulating themselves for the new media that they had invented and coming up with a new set of criteria for analysis that describes their work as meaningful and revolutionary and subversive and cutting-edge. </p>
<p>That sounds rather harsh.  I do not mean it in quite such a demagogic way.  And I do not mean it as a blanket description of all of the theory that we have read or of all of the artists whom we have read about.  Rather I feel this sort of criticism/theory is a part of the adolescent stage that all new writing/art goes through--while there is an inherent worth and indeed a revolutionary nature in a new art form, there is an accompanying tendency towards pretentiousness and self-congratulation. Just think about Ezra Pound and <cite>Blast</cite>.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by magoo on 9 October 2006 - 7:46pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>There's room for a lot of kinds of text. Lit people  often seem to feel there's kind of a hierarchy between high literature and popular, children's, or genre literature. But different texts do different things for different people at different times. Concepts like "high" or "low" may involve judgments that obscure more than they clarify.</p>
<p>But if that's true, does bringing more people into hypertext literature mean making every text accessible for a large population?</p>
<p>I wonder how Hayles could investigate the ideas she does in a text that worked only within familiar patterns.</p>
