    <div class="content"><p>So I just spent a little more time with Zork than I would have liked. And I didn't kill a damn thing. Aren't we supposed to get to kill things?</p>
<p>Or steal them? That's what the HELP says, but I can't imagine any remotely entertaining (or even interesting) method of going back and forth to that first room with the trophy case. I couldn't even consistently manage to walk out of whatever room (or whatever bizarrely specific, geographically or historically incompatible location) that I was in, and then walk back into it from the exact same direction: </p>
<p>"You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls<br />
and ceiling. There are passages to the north and east.<br />
A mass of ice fills the western half of the room.</p>
<p>&gt; walk north </p>
<p>You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream. The path<br />
travels to the north and the east.</p>
<p>&gt; walk south</p>
<p>There is a wall there.</p>
<p>&gt; walk north</p>
<p>You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls<br />
and ceiling. There are passages to the north and east.<br />
A mass of ice fills the western half of the room."</p>
<p>I recall being told in my (newly helpful) English 64 class that a big part of writing fiction is efficaciously moving people and things around in space. I realize that Zork is a game... but it is a text-based game... and the writing sucks.</p>
<p>Even internally, there seems to be confusion about what kind of written work Zork represents. That a narratorial figure pops in and out would seem relatively normal, were it not for the fact that Zork is a game, not a story, and the narratorial "I" clashes with the "I" of so many "don't understand"s offered up by the interface. Especially when that narrator claims the ability of sight, rendering himself present in the scene:</p>
<p>"You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here<br />
there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River<br />
upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still<br />
appear to loom far above. Following the canyon upstream (north and<br />
northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.<br />
Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the<br />
top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north. To the<br />
west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles<br />
around. It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here."</p>
<p>Who is this person and why do I care that his or her vision is better than average? And the definingly ephemeral nature of rainbows makes them a great device for demarcating a particular instance of time, I guess... only I don't think that's what the writer behind Zork is going for here. Instead it just gives us the feeling that the narrator is our travel companion, even though that's definitely not part of the premise of the game. </p>
<p>And regardless of his right to physically participate, sometimes the narrator just seems genuinely befuddled:</p>
<p>"You are in an art gallery. Most of the paintings which were here<br />
have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals<br />
left through the north, south, or west exits.<br />
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on<br />
the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty."</p>
<p>Somehow, the pseudo-narrator -- who previously stood beside me and admired the scenery -- knows that the vandals who took the paintings (that he somehow knows are absent) are possessed of "exceptional taste," despite the fact that the one work they didn't steal is the one "of unparalleled beauty." Now, it's these conflicted characters I'd like to know a little more about.</p>
<p>I suppose some of the murkiness of Zork comes from the challenge of writing in second person. And some of it must come from the need for a dialogic interface. But, really, there are rules that govern language. Not perfectly, of course... but if I wanted to combine a love of computer programming with a love of writing, I'd get ahold of the best grammar books that I could. And then things like this wouldn't have to happen:</p>
<p>"There is a coil of thin shiny wire here.</p>
<p>&gt; take coil</p>
<p>Which one do you mean?</p>
<p>&gt; take coil of wire</p>
<p>Which one do you mean?</p>
<p>&gt; take wire</p>
<p>Taken."</p>
<p>"Which"? Are there multiple coils? I mean, I went to public school as a kid, so basic sentence construction has always terrified me, but I'm pretty sure it's the "coil" -- which just happens to be made "of thin shiny wire" -- that I should be asking for. Maybe Zork's on a philosophical mission to change the way I think about the material world, but I'm willing to call this a design issue. And these types of interface curiosities seem to be all through Zork. Which would be fine, maybe even productive, if there were a consistent, underlying structure to be discovered in the language of the game, but Zork doesn't seem to have one, and the interface is regularly confounding. </p>
<p>I would say that the time I spent "in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike" was a microcosm for the whole of my experience with Zork, were it not for the fact that there was nothing "micro" about this period of time. For what must have been years, I guessed at the cardinal direction which might get me out of that damn maze, but since Zork's a little fuzzy on navigational continuity, I couldn't even attempt to put together a system for working my way blindly through a labyrinth. Again and again: "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike." My last blog post was about the maybe paradoxical nature of "narrative agency," and it was prompted by our readings about the ludic agency made available to the players of games. Zork's formulation of ludic agency seems pretty shoddy. Here again, there's confusion: game or written work?</p>
<p>But this final excerpt may be an even better representation of my impression of Zork:</p>
<p>"An extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace. Although<br />
you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you<br />
could get back down.</p>
<p>&gt; climb up chimney</p>
<p>I don't understand that.</p>
<p>&gt; walk up chimney</p>
<p>The chimney is too narrow for you and all of your baggage."</p>
<p>I wanted to go up the chimney for the very reason that it "seem[ed] unlikely" that I would be able to get back down. I wanted to progress in some way that Zork couldn't instantly reverse, either with its ever-shifting compass or by misunderstanding my input. But then it taught me to ask it to let me "walk up" chimneys, and commented on "all of [my] baggage." Right here I came the closest that I would to understanding the point of Zork: managing to get the loot out of the dungeon. But when the loot's really not that great, and the dungeon can't be effectively navigated even with a lantern and a torch... why bother?</p>
