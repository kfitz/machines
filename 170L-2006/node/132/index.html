    <div class="content"><p>I've been trying to think whether there's some way to fulfill the enormous promise that Landow and Joyce think that hypertext possesses.  The class seems to have come to some sort of consensus (although if there's a silent majority otherwise, please speak up!) that Joyce promises a writerly text but doesn't actually deliver on his promise.  As <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/130">marmalade</a> vividly put it in her last post, in "Afternoon," readers end up being rats running around in Joyce's maze, rather than equal parties to the writing process, because Joyce "expands to fill the vacuum" created by the absence of traditional editors in this new literary medium.  </p>
<p>So is there a way to get around this hierarchy of writer and reader that persists in hypertext?  (And is that what Landow and Joyce really want?  Or do they just want a more-equal, but not totally-equal, relationship between writer and reader?)  I'm not sure there is.  If you construct a hypertext so that any reader can edit any part of it, then it won't really be anyone's hypertext--it will be everyone's hypertext.  And that's called a wiki--actually, that seems pretty much what we're trying to do with our wiki.  </p>
<p>But can a piece of writing really be called a text when anyone can change it at any moment?  Perhaps my definition of 'text' is flawed, but it seems to me that a text must have some degree of continuity from one moment to the next.  Otherwise, someone could come in and delete everything and replace it with the word "pants."  Which would be amusing, except that that person would have so radically altered the content of the hypertext that it really couldn't be called the same hypertext as it was before.  It would be more like a whiteboard than a text.  Another quality that is part of my understanding of text is the possibility of analyzing it.  And it's nearly impossible to analyze something that's constantly changing.  With a wiki, at least you have all of the previous versions stored, but I don't know if that would be true with a universally-editable hypertext.</p>
<p>Anyone else have thoughts on whether there's some way to more fully realize Landow and Joyce's vision of hypertext?  Or on what makes a text a text?</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by tophat1 on 26 September 2006 - 10:45pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>One thing that we talked about briefly in class on Monday, that is important to keep in mind, is that even with a hypertext, the author has a vision that we work in.  I think we visualized it as a sort of map, that includes all the different links in the piece.  So, it is a text created by him or her that we read, it's just not in the traditional format of a book or article.  I think it is problematic at some level to compare hypertexts to books as if the former should somehow size up to or surpass the latter.  Hypertexts cannot replace books because they are two very different cases, at least to me.  If you approach a hypertext expecting the same satisfaction as a book, you will be disappointed.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I'm not suggesting that we strive to make hypertexts that 'live up to' books or surpass them (whatever that would mean.)  What I'm interested in is how we could create a hypertext that is the kind of writerly text that Barthes talked about.  And it seems to me that one necessary component of a truly writerly text would be the ability of the reader not just to change around the order of the parts, but to change (and add and delete) the parts themselves.</p>
<p>The reason I was thinking about the definition of 'text' is because I was wondering if the ultimate-writerly-hypertext (that was edit-able by any reader, not just a select group, like our wiki) could even be discussed or analyzed.  Joyce's "Afternoon" <em>can</em> be analyzed, even though the analysis is of a different sort than the analysis we perform on novels and poetry.</p>
<p>You say, tophat1, that "even with a hypertext, the author has a vision that we work in."  Does this have to be true?  Is an identifiable author with a coherent authorial vision a necessary part of the definition of a hypertext?</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 27 September 2006 - 11:58am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>It sounds, silversprung, as if you're advocating a total change in the definition of what an author vs. a reader is.  This author/reader relationship is a really cool question that I've been sort of struggling with myself.  If the reader of a "writerly" text can totally reshape it and add or subtract from it at will, what is it that makes him different from the original writer?  Perhaps he is working on the basis of someone else's original storyline, but then do we throw out Paradise Lost because it's based upon the Bible?  We consider Milton and author, and a highly creative one at that.  </p>
<p>So what is an author in this ideal writerly world?  I don't know.  </p>
<p>This also complicates your analysis question, too.  If a work exists in millions of forms and by millions of authors, establishing the intent of the author (let alone a definitive text) becomes a nightmare!</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Frabby on 27 September 2006 - 12:11am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I also think that texts need to maintain some continuity, but I think there should be more room for change, even in physical books. We revere the printed word and the published book so much that once itâ€™s sent off into the public, we canâ€™t comprehend taking it back. I guess Iâ€™m thinking of the James Frey brouhaha. After the smoking gun revealed main parts of A Million Little Pieces to be false, Frey released a new copy of the book with an explanation/apology at the beginning. I say, why not just re-write the book? This is kind of a stretch, but why should the false parts of his memoir continue to live in print, just because? Okay, Iâ€™m not really suggesting that Frey re-write his memoir, but still. I think itâ€™s an example that shows that texts shouldnâ€™t have to be the same forever and ever. </p>
<p>Also with our wiki, we do run a tiny risk of someone deleting everything and replacing it with â€œpantsâ€ (which would definitely be funny). But when a hypertext is edited within such a small community (our class), I think fear polices us from pulling anything to crazy. We donâ€™t want to incur the wrath of our peers, or even more frightening, look stupid in front of everyone. I think that texts that are written by a small community are likely to retain continuity long enough for analysis.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Anonymous on 27 September 2006 - 12:50pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Iâ€™m actually not sure how cohesive a piece our wiki is for analysis (at least in terms of plot).  I think that precisely because there are so many writers with such distinct ideas, it is often hard to follow the overall theme.  On the other hand, one of the most fascinating ways to analyze the wiki, I believe, is in terms of how it functions as a text (or â€œnot-textâ€, as sliversprung calls into question).  In other words, unlike â€œAfternoon,â€ I donâ€™t think that our wiki will have one set plot/theme/idea in mind (no matter how difficult it is to find that plotâ€¦) but, like â€œAfternoon,â€ I think it will be fun and worthwhile to study our wiki for its form and function.  Like Frabby said, fear (or respect for othersâ€™ writing) will keep each of us for changing what our classmates write, even if we firmly believe that what someone else wrote does not â€œfitâ€ into the piece, so it will be interesting to see what evolves.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Anonymous on 27 September 2006 - 4:39pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Getting around the writerly or readerly or wreaderly function seems a better reading of Joyce or Landow's theoretical position than Joyce's work itself. For instance, Joyce's text actually <strong>does</strong> have quite a bit of continuity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sentence structure is retained in a pretty normal way.</li>
<li>Paragraph structure is retained, too.</li>
<li>Even Aristotelian unity seems to be pretty well preserved:</li>
<ul>
<li>All events happen to one person;</li>
<li>all events are at least narrated on the same day.</li>
<li>We confront the character trying to solve one immediate practical problem</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>More than that, as frustrated as the class as a whole was, we did seem to understand the piece, at least in its large lines.<br />
  Yet some kind of operation seems to have not happened, or been problematized, no? What happens when we move from section to section of a book that does not happen when we move from section to section of <em>Afternoon</em>?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I don't see linked text as a matter of reader freedom. Authors write those links explicitly: they're determined by authorial intent. It can take as much time to set the links as it does to write the entire body of text.</p>
<p>The "freedom" could be taken that the text remains open to different interpretation. But doesn't that have to do with how syntactic or paratactic the lexia are, one against the other? After all, discontinuity can be done in print. Look at the <em>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</em> poets.</p>
<p>(A relatively gentle intro for those who haven't come across them:</p>
<p><a href="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/hejinian/">Lyn Hejinian</a></p>
<p><a href="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/silliman/">Ron Silliman</a> and <a href="http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/">his blog</a></p>

<p><a href="http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/scalapino/">Leslie Scalapino</a></p>
<p>Wiki's are closer to what Landow-Bolter-Joyce et al called for as "real" or "full" hypertext, but I'm not sure that they therefore resolve as narrative.</p>
