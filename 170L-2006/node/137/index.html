    <div class="content"><p>I'm still bothered by and intrigued with one of Joyce's points in "Othermindedness."  He says of Vassar students studying hypertexts, "They each expected a reader reading for herself, a reader much less concerned with knowing than knowing about.  Teaching and writing in the middle voice calls us to the realization that we have always been less geared toward knowing than knowing about" (65).  He gives the example of poet who asks his students to "name ten master-pieces of literature that you haven't read and know you will never read that nonetheless influence your life as a poet" (66).  Joyce's point struck me as good examples of how much we do--consciously or not--situate whatever we are reading or writing in terms of other pieces of literature.  Is our knowledge of what literature and novels are supposed to be like what turned so many of us off from "Afternoon"?  Did we try to know exactly what Joyce's plot means in "Afternoon", or was our main goal as readers to situate it within our overall body of literature?  If someone else came to a different conclusion from Joyce's words on "teaching and writing in the middle voice", I'd love to hear it because I certainly don't completely understand it.  Also, to turn to our wiki, how much of our narrative places itself within the typical, well-known form of narrative and how much of it consciously tries to rewrite the idea of what literature is?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>As to the wiki, how conscious/aware are we? I'll keep my ears open. </p>
<p>As to Joyce, I doubt dissonance with his theory or difficulty placing him in context causes frustration with <em>Afternoon</em>. I think we get from fiction because the first part of a story tempts us into certain conclusions; then the next parts of the story contradict the beliefs with which we reached the opening conclusions. Long stories like novels seem profound because they provide counterpoint to belief, counterpoint nuanced from scene to scene. </p>
<p>What I thought I heard in class was that people didn't feel they "got" him, yet my impression was that the peoples' comments did not reflect a lack of understanding: people knew what was going on. </p>
<p>Maybe the lack of the torque provided by necessary plot points (as in "OK, reader, this IS what happens next, and guess what? Because of the sequence, this WAS CAUSED by that last scene, so these things are inevitable, and you should adjust conclusions accordingly") keeps the story from accumulating the gravity to force/catalyze the reader to recontextualize ideas.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by silversprung on 27 September 2006 - 6:56pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>The tricky balance to strike in the wiki is between the intellectually-meta kinds of entries that, as you say, try "to rewrite the idea of what literature is," and the entries that read more like traditional stories.  The latter are perhaps less original in form, but the former can sometimes drift from being interesting to just being 'cute' without much substance-- whereas the latter usually have substantive content, even if the form is less novel.  (I think I have not concealed my personal bias very well...)</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 28 September 2006 - 8:49am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>My sister is a super-smart classics major at U Chicago, and she's been learning Greek for the past two years.  I spent a week or so with her this summer, and I remember her complaining about the difficulties involved in translating the middle voice.  It's somehow not English--it's somehow more self-reflective--it's very much a cooperative and beautiful idea.  As Joyce claims "the middle voice is a solitary but not a lonely pursuit, what Helene Cixous calls 'walking through the self toward the dark'" (64).  (Isn't that just a beautiful quote?)</p>
<p>I can't help but feel that some of this--this self-reflective, cooperative, solitary but not lonely feeling--is what Joyce is striving for.  We've interpreted it at times impossible to understand, malicious even.  But to him, hypertext is a "senseless beauty", basically an "as yet unrecognized new way of making sense" (63).  He believes that we don't understand the middle voice--we're too caught up in the English language as it is today, in English literature as it has been passed down to us.  Joyce is trying to create (maybe?) this sort of middle voice/middle place/middle mind and it's going to remake the way we think, read, and write.  </p>
<p>It seems to me that certain thoughts are only available in certain languages--certain methods of thinking have a certain grammar.  The middle voice exists in the Greek mentality but not in the English.  I know that when I think in German, I'm thinking in a much differnt manner than when I think in English.  I think this is what Joyce is trying to do: he's trying to change the way English--the language, the subject and the text--are constructed, and if/when he succeeds, he believes he'll have also altered the ways that we think.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I doubt the classes problems with <em>Afternoon</em> had much to do with not being able to place it historically. Maybe I'm wrong in some way -- avant garde's are rejected, rejected, rejected, then accepted. But the problem I see is that the benefit of what Landow and Joyce call freedom  seems to be a reader actively putting meaning together. The activity I refer to has nothing to do with whether someone clicks or flips pages, but everything to do with whether the reader is putting item A and item B together and thinking "Whoa! That must mean C." </p>
<p>Readers do that because parts fit one or another way. A few of us took the lexia of <em>Afternoon</em> to be vitally related, right? I'm guessing those readers enjoyed it -- Black Lace's response would be one example.  Other readers seemed to feel that the lexia did not relate or did not relate in a determinable way or that they did not inform one's reading of the lexia around them. Those readers, I suspect, did not enjoy <em>Afternoon</em>. </p>
<p>I think the solution for this kind of text consists in dropping the freedom rhetoric, working out why readers decide that lexia are consequentially related, and give them that. This is without making the manner in which the lexia relate overly definite, BTW. I'm not saying things can't or shouldn't relate questionably, but they must unquestionably relate.</p>
