    <div class="content"><p>1. I was really pleased by this statement (from page 99 of Writing Machines): "Contrary to much hype about electronic hypertext, books like <em>A Humument</em> allow the reader considerably more freedom of movement and access than do many electronic fictions."</p>
<p>...yep. I don't really have anything to say about that, except that I agree completely and so I wanted to point it out. Even if in hypertexty novels (like <em>House of Leaves</em>, which I love) we aren't making "choices" the way we do in electronic literature, we <em>are</em> able to make actual informed choices--like choosing to read the last page--instead of just clicking things at random. Hayles points out that "logical ordering and linear sequencing" are just as important as association (75), and while not all books are chronological, there is at least some sense of order, of beginning and end. And of course we can bookmark, highlight, etc. to our heart's content, which we can't do in hypertexts.</p>
<p>2. "Lexia to Perplexia" annoyed me. Or--well, it perplexed me, in the way that a lot of modern art perplexes me (sorry). It felt really pretentious, which was laughable in light of how outdated the design looked to me (see below). And after the amount of time I spent just trying to get the website to work...well, let's just say that my patience was put to the test. I got a lot more out of Hayles' commentary on it (which I read first) than I did out of the piece itself.</p>
<p>3. Like Natwwal and Lulu, I enjoyed "Disappearing Rain" a lot more than LtP. This story seems like good evidence for the idea that electronic literature could actually become popular. Larsen isn't a great writer, but it's an interesting story with actual characters, written in English--it's <em>actually a story</em>, which was refreshing after "reading" LtP. Even though I'm not sure all of the arrangements were meaningful, I thought the different pathways through the text (reading by character, by poem fragment, all of the river stuff) were neat--they lent the piece a sense of organization that was lacking in "Afternoon" and LtP. Finally, there were lists! My brain was really happy.</p>
<p>4. One thing I'm finding with a lot of these pieces, even the ones I enjoy, is that I get really distracted by the interface. Reading "Afternoon" in Classic felt bizarre, and I mean, it was barely in grayscale.</p>
<p>And "Disappearing Rain," while suited to the hypertext medium in ways that have <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/176#comment-281">already been described</a>, isn't exactly up-to-date. LtP, which <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/168">might be art</a>, has the same problem. They were both designed when web design was less advanced, and it's really, really evident in the way they look.</p>
<p>Which is interesting. I mean, when I pick up an old book--"old" in print being at least fifty years old, as opposed to an old webpage, which is maybe four or five years old--it has certain physical qualities that mark it as such. It smells different than a new book. It's probably made out of nicer materials than the average trade paperback if it's lasted long enough to get to me--maybe it's got a leather cover or thicker paper.</p>
<p>Those are minor differences, though. There's nothing aesthetically displeasing about an old book the way there is with an old webpage. Electronic literature is unique in how quickly it becomes visibly outdated. We've talked about the technology becoming obsolete in terms of its not being supported by newer operating systems, and in a medium that is changing (and advancing) as rapidly as the internet, there are issues that are purely stylistic. I've passed over many a potentially informative webpage because it looked like it was made by the Angelfire Page Builder circa 1997--the fact that it just looks so old implies that the information (or whatever) it contains is no longer relevant.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Hey thisismycheese--I really enjoyed reading your post.  It summed up quite clearly a lot of things that I had been thinking about a lot less clearly.</p>
<p>I, too, came across that quote in Hayles and felt gratified.  Yes, there is a unique freedom in books that we/our readings have ignored--an ability to just open to any page and absorb the words there.  Which ever page.  At whatever moment.  It's like all those people that used to "i-Ching" the Bible or the Aeneid--you know, just open it up and see what wisdom God/chance/Virgil was offering you.  I can't really imaging "i-Ching"-ing <cite> Afternoon</cite>, can you? ;)</p>
<p>Also, I feel like this whole idea of becoming outdated is really important for the whole hypertext community--look at Michael Joyce or Robert Coover (the fellow in Hayles who didn't like second-generation hypertexts because they had lost their "voice").  One of their problems with hypertexts was the rapidity with which they became outdated, as well as the reliance they were developing on ever-newer, swankier-looking technologies (at the expense of inherent, text-based qualities, like voice).  </p>
<p>Lastly--I was taking a series of art classes at our museum of art two summers ago, and one class coincided with the opening of annual "May Show", a series of exhibits focusing on local, modern artists.  My favorite exhibit (I listened to the artist introducing it and almost laughed myself into permanently being banned from the museum) was a giant icebox/freezer with a blue light fixed under the lid.  The title of the piece was: "I feel cold and empty inside."  Yep.  Modern art.</p>

  <div class="content"><p><em>Humument</em>'s cool, but would you really write in the margins? Ouch!</p>
<p>Also, it's not a very typical book, is it? I don't mean that you implied it was. But even as recently as 1980, when this was published, reproduction and publishing of such things was terribly difficult and expensive, and I'm grateful for the digital systems that have finally brought copy into my grasp. </p>
<p>Also, I'm interested -- does <em>A Humument</em> have a recognizable plot, or if not plot, some kind of center or continuity? If so, is that what makes it more interesting? If not, what <strong>does</strong> make it interesting? Can it be merely the matter of paper reproduction?</p>
