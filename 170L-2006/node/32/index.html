    <div class="content"><p>This post will be highly dispersed (and, now that I've looked back over it, awfully long) because I have a million ideas running around in my head after finishing this coming week's reading.  I've never read any media theory before, and my brain feels like it's been exploded (or imploded, or both--you'd have to ask McLuhan.)</p>
<p>First, a bit of self-conscious reflection on reading the texts with Professor Fitzpatrick's underlining and margin notes on them:  it seems like an unusual kind of hypermediacy, in which one of the media is totally dependent-- even parasitic-- on the other, but it is the dependent medium that is evaluating and assigning value to the medium upon which it depends.  It sounds like one of Ong's (many) paradoxes.</p>
<p>When Ong is talking about writing and computers as passive technologies, it became apparent to me that he must be writing before the advent of blogs, because many of the common criticisms he offers of writing and computers when both were new technologies-- that they are fundamentally 'unresponsive' and 'passive', unable to defend themselves against criticism-- don't apply to blogs, which are highly interactive, and in fact make possible the kind of person-to-person conversation that Plato thought was superior to writing.  I looked at the copyright page of Ong's book, and although it was reprinted as recently as 2004, it must not have been updated within the last 5 years or so, or I have to think that he would have noted the blogging phenomenon.</p>
<p>Unlike marmalade, I found the McLuhan the most interesting-- although also by far the most incomprehensible-- of the three works.  I tried to get some sort of a handle on all the things he was saying by thinking about them in relation to-- what else?-- blogs.   Here are two of my "insights":</p>
<p>1. As McLuhan states on the first page of his book, and many times thereafter, "the medium is the message."  I can certainly see how with blogs, the medium of the blog itself is a crucial part of the message of the blog, regardless of what the blog's specific content is.  But it seems to me that the content of blogs can vary so widely that the message can matter as well as the medium (and McLuhan would certainly disagree with me here.)  For instance, <a href="http://volokh.com">The Volokh Conspiracy</a> would inspire fundamentally different kinds of comments and relationships between users (argumentative, intellectual, etc.) than, say, <a href="http://chinabounder.blogspot.com/index.html">Chinabounder</a>, or any other personal, journal-style blog, which I think would inspire mostly voyeuristic (in the former) and personal, non-argumentative relationships and comments.  But then maybe McLuhan would respond that if two blogs affect human consciousness and relationships in completely different ways, that makes them two different types of media.  (To which I would respond: "That's a cop-out argument.")</p>
<p>2. McLuhan writes: "Any new invention or technology is an extension or self-amputation of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body." (45)  What does this statement mean for the writer of Chinabounder, whose blog seems to exist soley for the purpose of chronicling what he does with his body?  According to McLuhan, having a blog that reports on what happens to your body would change the nature of what your body does.  Would Chinabounder have carried out his sexual exploits in the same way had he not been writing about them in a blog?  I think McLuhan would say no-- his sexuality is fundamentally changed by his chronicling it.  On a silly note, I bet that Chinabounder has never considered his blog an implement of self-castration...</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 10 September 2006 - 7:09pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I guess one of the most notable things about McLuhan for me was his hype--which was also a major turn off.  It almost sounded as if he was ranting--albeit very intellectually--in a very blog-y, demagogic way.  He is trying to personally engage his reader--he almost seems to anticipate the "immediacy" of the blog world.  Further, his prose was incredibly inflammatory--it felt, at times, like I was reading something not by McLuhan but rather by McCarthy, a feeling that was further enforced by his discussion of the A bomb, the H bomb, the bomb shelter, and the "unfortunate" telegraph line between Moscow and Washington.  </p>
<p>Some examples of McLuhan's inflammatory style:<br />
--The new media is like "surgery carried out on the social body with complete disregard for antiseptics" (64)<br />
--In modern times "man must serve his technology with the same servo-mechanistic fidelity with which he served his coracle,... (etc)" (56)<br />
--The electric light ended the regime of night and day" (52)<br />
--Trying to prove the un-importance of content, he intones that General Sarnoff's emphasis upon it "is the voice of current somnabulism", ending the passage with the explosive paraphrase that "if the TV tube fires the right ammunition at the right people, it is good" (11).</p>
<p>"servo-mechanistic fidelity"?  the "regime of day and night"?  (oh the repression!) "somnabulism"! "ammunition" !  These are fighting words!</p>

  <div class="content"><p>It's true-- McLuhan does say some pretty ridiculous things.  I guess I don't mind so much because in the struggle to figure out what these outrageous phrases are referring to, my brain gets a lot of exercise-- perhaps more than it does when I read a set of arguments that are more conservative/ better-thought-out/ better-explained.  A friend who knows something about media theory told me that McLuhan is a big figure in the world of media studies, and I can see why-- his theories are incredibly provocative.  Even if I don't always agree with them, they almost always make me think.</p>
