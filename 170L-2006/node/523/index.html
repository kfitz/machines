    <div class="content"><p>While watching The Onyx (i spell it "onxy" every time, backspace backspace "yx") clips made available on the project's website one thought couldn't help but tumble about in my bewildered mind: What ever happened to Calista Flockhart?</p>
<p>I'm referring of course to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118254/">Ally McBeal. </a> I never really watched the show, save for the off-chances when I could catch glimpses of the then-unknown-to-me Lucy Liu (*swoons*), but I remember a really big deal was made about the first few episodes, because there were all sorts of... *ahem,* "wacky" Looney-Tunes-esque computer animated graphics and what not integrated into the show... She sees an attractive male and her tongue starts wagging, or a co-worker says something frustrating and she shoots them with a bow and arrow or whatever...Her imagination being played out on screen and what not. I think the point was something along the lines of "Lookit everybody! We're taking the traditional legal dramedy and making it all snazzy! Ally (yeah, you can call her that too!) is a normal person, just like you and me, and lookit all her madcap adventures and wacky reactions to the stuff that happens!" I think a more important point is that by the second season or so (possibly earlier?) they cut all the animated crap and gave their audience the same old stuff. It won Emmys (are those the awards TV shows get? I don't really "do" the TV thing...) and etc but i'm guessing the producers realized that the same old crap in a pretty bonnet is still the same old crap, and looks downright silly once people get bored of the gimmicky animated stuff. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the Onyx project. Funny how they have to repeat that "NAVworlds" are most certainly not movies, and don't you ever forget it. I wonder who exactly they're trying to convince. I'm leaning towards "Themselves," but it's probably "Whichever sucker with a wallet we can reel in." In relation to Ally's Crap-in-A-Bonnet problem, i begin to wonder if there's any more "substance" to this... err.... not-a-movie, than the two clips. I tried tracking it down via my plethora of shady sources but i get the distinct feeling that it isn't exactly a "hot" item. I get the feeling that this project is an attempt to engage the viewer, to place the audience in the uncomfortable role of making decisions, rather than being fed something static. I'm glad the text on the site explicitly states "this is not a choose your own adventure movie," because... wow, that's... well, exactly what it is. A NAVworld isn't a movie because you'd have a hell of a time trying to sell anyone at all a bunch of assorted clips of boring monologues, with images ripped from news feeds slapped in for dramatic effect. I hate to take the cynical route here but give me a break... Quote:</p>
<p>"Video games present worlds. We love video games. But video games are programmed. NAVworldsâ„¢are written, directed, acted and edited.We love movies and video games. And, we now invite you and your imagination to explore and experience a new form of video story telling -- NAVworldâ„¢ -- by purchasing and experiencing The Onyx Project."</p>
<p>I would've let them slide with a slap on the wrist for peddling someone's half-finished high-school art project as a commodity, and even perhaps taken a bit more time to appreciate the possible artistic ideas that may be floating about. But first, take a look at that main page: Every. Single. Section. Clips, a bit of copy, whatever, then the glaring "23.95! Order Now! Amazon Link!" I was waiting for the little voice to chime in "If you call within the next fifteen minutes, shipping and handling is on us!" Something tells me someone is trying oh so desperately to make "NAVworlds" (i get the feeling it's supposed to be typed like that, in the same way that "Legos" aren't "Legos," but "Lego Bricks," and don't you ever forget it) a household name, a new-age buzzword / cashcow like "Podcasts"  or "Blogs." Yeah, i went there. But no, they couldn't stop there. They had to sucker-punch Video Games. I had to read that bit about three times because I most certainly did not see that one coming. But it makes sense. The Huffington Post comment on the side mentions that History proves that non-linear is "in," because movie sales are outstripped by video game sales. So... the movie industry is taking a hit, and video games are gaining some kind of foothold, at least as far as investors are concerned. This makes me interested in NAVworlds why?</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VI (that's 6, and not the oft-praised 7) is one of my most treasured narrative experiences, and not because i watched a story develop while I clicked buttons. And The Sims isn't the best-selling video game of all time because you get to click things and make different things happen. Though it was a bit linear, and i was only 9, Final Fantasy 6 presented my wee-psyche with a compelling view of the full ramifications of Global War, families and lives rent asunder, and arcing storylines that required heaps of dedication on my part for my digital protagonists to see any sort of light at the end of the proverbial tunnel.The Opera scene still makes me tremble (google Aria di Mezzo Carattere, i'm not alone), 12 years later. And the Sims... Gamer Theory (i refuse to use leet speak) touched upon it... Our Sims become extensions of ourselves. Every time Lonnie (that's what i named my "favorite" one) came home from his Writer / Journalist job and pet Sparky (his siberian husky) and made a TV dinner and sat on the couch and watched horror movies alone till two in the morning, i got sort of... nervous. It's a different sort of narrative to engage, one that the user defines and creates. People aren't paying so they can have the privilege of making a story react to their clicking. They're shelling out cash for expansion pack after expansion pack because they've created an existence in which their avatars  or whatever are scraping out their own niche in the world. It's compelling because we see rats in a maze, a microcosm of our own rat-race, and we want more for them, more for ourselves. Or maybe we like watching digital dramas unfold. Or maybe we want to see what happens when we throw crazy Sim parties and make the Sims dance in cages. It's all user-defined, it's a great big sandbox and we're all kids again, making castles and bashing them down. NAVworlds is a paltry attempt at cashing in on a gimmick, and comparing itself to either Movies or Video Games simply cheapens both forms of narrative.</p>
<p>For an example of an alternative form of narrative that does an incredible job of eliciting a variety of responses without trying to define itself as something it's not, check out <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103767/#comment"> Baraka, </a> which my suitemates and I just finished watching. I was a bit wary, as it's billed as an environmental documentary or somesuch, but it's more like a video-essay of the World. No dialogue, just images. Scenes. Nature. Humanity. You'll have to see it to get any sort of idea of what i'm talking about. And that's the best part about it--it's whatever you want it to be. Our take was that the film would probably best be viewed in... a state of altered consciousness i'll say. But the experience while watching it... a shift from idle chatter and commentary-- "that monkey looks pissed. and he's probably so cold and wet someone should get him a sweater"-- that drifts into awe as Aborigonees perform elaborate ceremonial dances  that reverts to complete silence and despair as thousands of baby chicks are shot through tubes, driven along conveyor belts, tossed into bins according to sex and then dumped into cages, where they grow up to be the chickens we snack on at the dining hall. There was a serious moment of "maybe we should go vegetarian?" before we went to pick up fast food. Short lived, but we all felt it. It's the kind of film that doesn't need to "force" a viewer to question and discuss by throwing out "Do you turn to page 6 or 19... and for the love of god why!?!" A narrative that develops solely because the images invoked compel the audience to real emotion, real questions... </p>
<p>Head to youtube and run a search on Ferenc Cako for yet another example, it should point you to his sand animations at SICAF (Seoul's International Cartoon and Animation Festival) in 2003. Well, at least that gets me thinking... about permanence and the temporal nature of existence and the like. </p>
<p>Reading over my absolute loathing of NAVworlds and the gimmick they're trying to milk cash out of i'm suddenly reminded that my Final project revolves around Flash and a narrative that develops through clicking stuff. Ugh. Back to the drawing board.</p>
