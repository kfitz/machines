    <div class="content"><p>Something that has been on my mind for a little while now and has consequently passed its class discussion expiration date. . .  McLuhan makes a big deal out of the idea that media provide us with extensions of ourselves, but what if the medium is unreliable? I'm concerned only about the mechanics of the medium, not about the misrepresentation of any "real" world. I mean what happens when you reach for something and it's just not <a href="http://www.lakdnflsdkfponekdl.com">there</a>? Objects in the physical world rarely surprise us with their sudden absence; very few things seem to be there but aren't. We don't tolerate books with missing pages, or television signals that spontaneously drop segments from shows. But the internet, which we imagine will one day encompass all content everywhere, is full of dead links, of pages that don't turn. How many times has class in ITS been momentarily derailed by a misdirected browser? And thanks to our sexy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">embedded hyperlinks</a>, even search engines can't help locate the truant content of the blogosphere.</p>

I read the whole thing and can find nowhere in which Armstrong shows that the concept of individualism was not simply a manifestation of society that the novel has mirrored</cite>, and as follow up to our class discussion, here's an attempt to put some perspective on the modern subject--and hence, on Armstrong's potentially outrageous claim that, during the late eighteenth-century, "novels were acquiring the power to endow their readers with individuality" (3)--by giving it a relative framework.</p>

It does bing up, though, the whole concept of the toy with a computer chip.  Toys that interact with kids, toys that are meant to learn.  Alright, so maybe Elmo's not a great example, but between the article and the furbies quietly pretending to sleep on my windowsill as they plot to take over the world, it's all at the forefront of my mind at the moment.</p>
<p>It's interesting to me, that while there is a certain level of fear of technology getting smarter than us, taking over humanity, a notable portion of children's toys on the market today are this sort of technology.  I remember when furbies frst came out, and were declared potential threats to national security, since they could learn and repeat state secrets (I somehow doubt this, as mine mostly sneeze and declare "FOOOOOM!" though there is the occasional astute observation of "Bo-ring!"  The friend who gave them to me last year, though, warned me that the first generation of furbies had twice the learning capacity they were designed to have.  That's quite creepy right there.)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Because we've been mainly focusing on blogs as electronic literature, I've forgotten about the other forms of e-writing out there.  And then Marmalade's post made me remember one of my favorite online writing forms out there: fanfic!</p>
<p>My cousin has been maintaining a fanfiction site for about 4 years.  She's an avid fan of Harry Potter and creates her own Harry Potter tales based on the characters in the Harry Potter series. For those who aren't acquainted with the "fanfic" world, it's basically an "alternate universe" of sorts, with the stories based on popular media (books, movies, TV shows). Usually, the younger writers will write really sappy stories involving the love lives of main characters from a TV series or book, but among the millions of fanfic writers, you'll occasionally find an amazing writer, one whose works are even better than the original. Apparently, there are some Harry Potter fanfic-ers whose works and plotlines are considered to be even more original than J.K.Rowling's.  J.K. Rowling herself even admits to reading fanfiction in her spare time. As to whether the fanfiction influences her own writing, I am not sure, but that is an interesting question to ask, and brings up the issue of writer-audience interaction. The internet has allowed the writer to connect with her audience in a way that would never have been imaginable before. Does this mean that we, as readers, may even have input into and influence on our favorite authors' works?  How much do present-day authors cater to the wishes of the fans in the fanfic world, and should they?  It almost seems like writing a novel, which before seemed to be a closed affair for the author, has become an event for the public.  The Harry Potter phenomenon is especially interesting because the series hasn't even ended, yet there are thousands of fanfic-ers that have already written their own versions of "Book 7."  Quite unheard of before the internet age.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I did.  It felt like the apocalypse, seriously.  And it was down from what...7 pm to 10 pm?  And not even all of it was gone.  ITS said something about a "backbone" of the internet being down, and thus the pages associated with it wouldn't work.<br />
I didn't care what the reason was.  I felt like I was suddenly all alone and cut off from the world - especially since AIM didn't work.  My room was suddenly empty.  I was really quite shocked to see how adversely it affected me.<br />
That got me thinking - what would happen if say, the whole West Coast lost internet for a week or so?  Or worse, the whole US?  Would our economy crash?  Would the automated transit stop?  On the other hand - would more people actually be outside, talking to their neighbors, like during the big blackout in New England in summer 2003?  There were certainly a lot of people at the Junior/Senior Symposium tonight, mostly people who didn't know what to do with themselves without the internet.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>So, in section 3 of the Bush reading, he asks, "...will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record?"</p>
<p>When I first read that, I said, "haha," and then  remembered that the technology does in fact exist. I could buy some software and voila! I could talk to my computer and it would do the typing for me.</p>
<p>...right. I would never, ever do that. It would hurt my brain.</p>
<p>Do any of you have experience with this software? I know of one blogger who uses it, but it seems like it's uncommon. Obviously it's not perfect software, which is part of the problem (after all, if you're spending time correcting errors, you might as well just type)--but I wonder if there's a deeper issue with the idea of speaking writing instead of writing it. Ong talked about how literacy has shaped the way we think, but at least personally, I <em>can't</em> think unless I write, at least not as well or as articulately (not that I'm articulate here). I'm attached to the physical process of writing, to actually feeling words form, and speaking and then seeing the words appear on the screen doesn't quite cut it.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>In light of the last two posts (Marmalade's comment that perhaps there is something more out there then blogs and Lulu's comment about "trash culture") I'm not sure how welcome this post will be. But I guess I didn't care too much because I posted it anyways. So another comment on trash and blogs: some minor celebrities have started protesting their constant appearance on popular entertainment blogs. What mainly comes to mind is the Fergie (of Black Eyed Peas fame) debacle. Her new song, "Pedestal," attacks bloggers like Perez Hilton for saying mean things about her and then hiding "behind computer screens." I thought this was pretty amusing because it certainly paints blogging in a different light then that hot song "We Didn't Start the Weblogs" and because, well, it's just funny.</p>

<p>Not that the blog isn't fascinating and exciting and way cool (etc) but it strikes me that maybe we've been beating it a bit to death these last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>This has been sort of running around in my head, esp in relationship with our projected wiki.  I guess I just feel that there must be more out there.  I mean, is the blog the end all and be all of online writing?  Sure, we've tossed around a couple of NYTimes articles, and our choices from the blog spectrum have been pretty broad (everything from the blogs of lawyers and politicians to collections of stuff like postsecret), but we seem to be circling around this one great big grail that is the blog.</p>

I started out by replying to the comment, but then I realized that my comment was starting to get really really long and that I was going off on all sorts of related and unrelated tangents, triggering much incoherent rambling.  It was starting to turn into an exposition on all my feelings, as an individual, towards blogging and technology in general.

There is always the possibility that a random person will stumble on our blog, but in all liklihood, people from our class are the only ones who will read a given post.  Similarly, people in our class can't just stop reading the blog if they get bored.  The set audience makes me far more self-concious about what I say.</p>
<p>2.  Everyone who reads this blog has at least some knowledge of me in real life.  As a result, it isn't possible for this blog to become my identity to the blog's readership.  Readers will certainly filter my posts through what they know of me in real life, and something I post on this blog may influence the way people perceive me or my comments in class.</p>
