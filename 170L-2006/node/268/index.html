</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I'm reading the most strangely beautiful book--I thought it was going to be a book about authorship, but it's turned out to be this beautiful musing on what it is to read and be reader... its a collection of this man's insights into his lifelong love affair with books--the author is someone called Sven Birkerts, and what's he's written is called <cite>The Gutenberg Elegies</cite>.</p>
<p>I Link+-ed it because it had a chapter on hypertexts, but as soon as the librarian brought it out to me, I knew I'd not gotten what I'd expected.  It looked like a novel--a normal paperback--rather than anything remotely scholarly.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had a long wait at the doctor's office, and I spent an even longer time bonding with an ice pack this afternoon, and to speed the minutes along, I started to read it.  And it's gorgeous.</p>
<p>I finally got to the chapter on the hypertext this evening, and it's (once again) not what I had expected.  Birkets frames the discussion by describing his own first experience reading a hypertext--Moulthrop's <cite>Victory Garden</cite> with a friend.  While the rest of the book is about his experiences as a reader and a writer, this chapter was more about his experiences as a person confronted by something he doesn't totally understand or appreciate.  He voices so eloquently some of the reservations we had had with hypertexts!</p>
<p>But his philosophizing takes him even further than feeling old and scared by something his doesn't totally grasp.   He starts to make points about electronic writing in general--about what it is to write on a computer vs. with paper and pen, tying it back somehow to how it is that we actually think these days.</p>
<p>I'm going to stick in quite a long quote (my apologies) to give you all an idea of what I'm talking about--his eloquence is much more inspiring than anything that I could generate:</p>
<p>"The shape of the word--its physical look--is only its outer garb.  The impulse, the pulse of its meaning, is the same whether that word is incised in marble, scraped into mud, inscribed onto papyrus, printed onto a page, or flickered forth on a screen.  Or is it?  Wouldn't we say that the word cannot really exist outside the perception and translation by its reader?  If this is the case, then the mode of transmission cannot be disregarded.  The word cut into stone carries the implicit weight of the carvers intention; it is decoded into sense under the aspect of its imperishability.  It has weight, grandeur--it vies with time.  The same word, when it appears on the screen, must be received with a sense of its weightlessness--the weightlessness of its presentation.  The same sign, but not the same. </p>
<p>"This ever-present awareness of fixity, of indelibility, is no longer so pressing a part of the writer's daily struggle  That is, the writing technology no longer enforces it.  Words now arrive onto the screen under the aspect of provisionality. They can be transferred with a stroke or deleted altogether.  And when they are deleted it is as if they had never been.  There is no physical reminder of the wrong turn, the failure.  At a very fundamental and obvious level, the consequentiality of bringing forth language has altered.  Where the limitations of the medium once encouraged a very practical resistance to the spewing out of the unformulated expression, that responsibility has now passed to the writer.  </p>
<p>"To theorize along these lines is to court ridicule.  Present the average reader with prose originally written onto the screen and prose typed onto the page, and he will wonder what is the difference.  The words are the same, of course.  More or less.  Yet at some level, perhaps molecular, they are not the same.  The difference?  It must originate in the writer, more precisely in the writer in the act of composition."</p>
<p>And this one of the things that I feel Birkets' whole book has made me think about.  How is the consequential nature of thought--as it's tied up in writing--been changing as we gradually switch to a more "wired" form of composition and interaction?  Isn't this blog an excellent example (zoey has sort of raised this point earlier) of the "spewing out of unformulated expression"?  And while that's in some ways creative and inspiring, isn't is also in some way reductive--it reduces language and writing to something infinitely less meaningful--something very "weightless"?</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-437" class="active">Technologies of consciousness</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Oz on 25 October 2006 - 12:56am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Thanks for sharing this -- it's really wonderful.  As I was reading Birkerts's ideas on how the method of composition somehow alters the biological makeup of the words composed, I kept thinking of a passage from Sharon Cameron's book, <cite>Thinking in Henry James</cite>.  She, like Birkerts seems to be, is also a uniquely great critic -- one of my professors described her as thinking so clearly that she gives you the illusion that you're also thinking that clearly.  At any rate, here's what Cameron has to say about James's transition from handwriting to dictation, and about the playwright Eugene O'Neill, who could no longer write anything at all after Parkinson's made him unable to write by hand:</p>
<p>"James's departure from his customary mode of composition inevitably calls into question in a perfectly mundane way the site or location of consciousness.  For in the process under consideration consciousness occurs in the mind, but its content is then immediately spoken to another who writes it down, or types it out, a practice which in effect exteriorizes thought and moves it between persons." </p>
<p>On the other hand, "[O'Neill] could not make the transition between writing and dictating his plays . . . 'His thoughts, he told Carlotta, flowed from his brain, through his arm and into his pencil; there was no other process by which he could write.'  For O'Neill, as presumably for James, the work in the mind and the means of externalizing it are not, then, separable; how one has been thinking motorically, or rendering one's thinking, does not simply affect consciousness; it is a part of that consciousness . . . Thus, the means of production is tied both to the idea and to the retrieval of the idea."</p>
<p>In other words, I think its a very valid idea that thought changes along with the medium of its expression, but does that mean that the content of those thoughts -- by being, as Cameron would say, less <em>in</em> us and more <em>between</em> us -- has less meaning, less gravity?  I hope not.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 25 October 2006 - 12:51pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I know very little about O'Neill--that's really fascinating, how hampered he felt by dictation.  And if Cameron is anything like Birkets, I'd love to read more.  I kept thinking of Milton as I read your quotation...  Sometimes externalizing thoughts allows writers to achieve brilliant things, but then (like with O'Neill) sometimes it limits them drastically.  Perhaps there is a difference between being a writer and an author?  Some people need to write in order to articulate their idea, for others, the idea exists independently?  Or is that not even valid?</p>
<p>But to step back, perhaps the question being posed is not whether the electronically-expressed thought has less gravity--it's more whether the thought has been clearly and adequately expressed in the electronic medium.   But I fear that I'm not expressing myself terribly clearly here either... ;) How's this: maybe the fear is that we can express ourselves so very easily today that we do not take the time to do it terribly accurately?  That we "spew" rather than refine?  </p>
<p>And isn't part of the quality of a thought the accuracy and beauty and overall clarity of its expression?  Isn't that what Henry James (paradoxically, considering his verbosity and complexity) desired?  </p>
<p>So thank you for those quotations.  And for helping to work out these ideas.  I think there's so much here yet to say...</p>
