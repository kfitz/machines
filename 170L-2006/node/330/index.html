    <div class="content"><p>So, talking in class Monday about "Kind of Blue" triggered a bunch of thoughts that I shall attempt to present coherently, but no promises.  </p>
<p>~Was "Kind of Blue" originally emailed?<br />
~What impact does seeing it all at once instead of in controlled installments have?<br />
~What's that "after Blue Company by Rob Wittig" on the bottom of the main entrance page?<br />
~I wonder how an email novel would work on the page?<br />
~Hey, I read one of those years ago, time to look up "Exegesis" and share it with y'all.<br />
~Hmm, not quite what I remember, but still worth mentioning.<br />
~There's this other writing project called Exegesis that I'm just starting to poke and I'm not sure what I think about it.<br />
~The lack of a completely standardized keyboard (while I understand it's for issues of space) really irks me, because the muscle memory when I try to use the page up, page down, end &amp; home keys often results in nasty things happening.<br />
~Aesthetically, I really like ~</p>
<p>So.  Turns out "Kind of Blue" was originally emailed to its recipiants.  As was its predecessor, <A href="http://www.robwit.net/bluecompany2002/">"Blue Company."</A></p>
<p>Haven't had a chance to read through all of "Blue Company" yet, but it seems like it's all Berto's correspondences to Susanne.  Very different kind of story.  It works more as a voyeur thing, perhaps it can be interpreted as you're Skip, being bcc'ed on everything.  It doesn't have the slightly sinister aspect of "Kind of Blue," with the FBI-type feel.  </p>
<p>I think "Blue Company" works really well as a serial story (hey, that's something we really haven't talked about much yet).  I think it probably loses something when you can read through it all at once, but it still works, and is still fundementally the same story.</p>
<p>"Kind of Blue" changes drastically when it's not mailed day to day.  There's so much more going on there, so many more people directly involved.  I don't think it would feel like an investigation if it were spreads out over time, if one couldn't read it all at once.  And I think something gets lost by not having the varying...saturations?  quantities?  the word was just ine my head and ran out, but the number of emails fluxuating day by day, and the time between each person's correspondence, I think there's a different story, or at least a different perspective to be had from getting it in real time.</p>
<p>I think emails lose a lot when printed out, when compiled.  Changing the medium, the nature of how the medium is used, has a weird effect on the content that I can't *quite* articulate.  I guess for me, when it's on the net, it's, in theory, ever-editable.  you can change and, for most intents and purposes, get rid of the original original so people see what you want them to see at 10am sober, not what you wrote at midnight plastered.  And with email, you always have what you wrote in hand, should you wish, so you can go back, reference, reread and examine conversations in a different way than most correspondences.  When it's in print, it suddenly feels a lot more permanent, because there's the loss of editablity.</p>
<p>Back when I was in high school, I read this book, <strong>Exegesis</strong>.  I'm thinking it was junior year, because I'm fairly certain I drove to the library by myself, and it was definitely when the actually library was being refurbished, so about half the books were put in storage, and the other half were in the bare concrete storefront that used to be a petshop, next to the grocery store.  (In retrospect, it's rather intriguing, the books I was able to get from the library while it was all packed away, only once did I have to request something be pulled, and I'm kinda surprised, given the facade my town presented, that the books I found interesting were deemed circulatable enough to merit the prime real estate of the limited shelfspace).</p>
<p>Anyways, <strong>Exegesis</strong>.  All I remembered about it before looking it up online was that it was a bunch of collected emails.  After much poking around, which eventually ended in giving in and checking for it on <A href="http://www.amazon.com/Exegesis-Astro-Teller/dp/037570051X/sr=8-1/qid=1162419063/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-3993107-3137566?ie=UTF8&s=books">amazon</A> (Why is it called amazon?  Is it a...river of information and Stuff?  I mean, it's not like I think "ooo, books, definitely South American rainforest region"), which got me the authors name (Astro Teller) (so maybe I picked up the book because it had a pretty, pop-y cover.  I admit, I'm that shallow, and do often choose books for pleasure, at least for initial perusal, by the cover), and meandered my way to the book's <A href="../Astro%20Teller/index.html">official website</A>.  </p>
<p>Reading about it, I find myself wanting to find it again and read it now that I've actually spent time on the internet, and have a slightly more nuanced view of things.  The gist of the story is that a young programmer, Alice (there's a loaded name for ya), creates an AI, Edgar, who is super smart and she falls in love with it, and the FBI tries to take it over because it is so smart and gatehrs so much info, and Alice tries to save it.  I don't remember if there's more to it, but I do remember liking it.  </p>
<p>Formatwise, it's Alice and Edgar's correspondences, which take a rather emailish form.  In this case, I think printing it in a book puts it more in the realm of definite fiction, because one is not interacting with an actual machine that has a bunch of the building blocks of Edgar.  </p>
<p>In my googlish search for this book, I tripped across another...book? called <A>Exegesis.</A>  This one's by <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick">Philip K Dick.</A>  I've poked at it a bit, I'm not quite sure what I think of it.  But it seems like the kind of thing that could keep me up til 4am.  There are several bits that play a lot with Christianity, and I kinda want to get my hands on the printed copy of Exegesis, and VALIS, purely for the potential mind-f**k factor.</p>
