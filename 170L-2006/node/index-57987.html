    <div class="content"><p>I've been getting a bit back-logged on my magazine reading in the past couple weeks, so  the Thanksgiving-break flight-time was an awesome opportunity to catch up.  </p>
<p>I was reading in <cite>The New Yorker</cite> about video games, rather surprisingly.  Actually <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/061106fa_fact">the article</a> is about game designers--more specifically Sim City (and more) designer Will Wright.</p>
<p>It was funny to read, especially in the context of our discussions last week about the role of the gamer vs. the role of the game designer.  The article definitely manages to present Wright as an author, or at least, perhaps, as an artist.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I was fairly suspicious of N. Katherine Hayles' essay, "Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers," when I first began reading it.  </p>
<p>First off, my feelings about the notion of "materiality" go back and forth. On the one hand, it does sort of make sense that the physical embodiment of words -- or lack thereof -- would be an important issue. This just seems to be a more nuanced take on the tension that exists between writing and speech, which people have been writing and speaking about for a long, long time. And despite these roots in antiquity, it's thoroughly postmodern to suggest that we are shaped so significantly by our environment. On the other hand, I think that language exists and interacts in more abstract states (another idea at home in the writing v. speech and language v. thought dyads) than materiality addresses. I don't think that an emphasis on materiality is necessarily antithetical to an understanding of language as something partly insubstantial, but I do think that materiality is a convenient tool in the hands of a reductionist. It's easy, when materiality is foregrounded, to pre-emptively decide what the concerns of a piece are. I think we've often been guilty of it this semester -- we look at a work, and maybe even without reading it in its entirety, conclude that its chief concerns are all the technological/theoretical ideas that we float in class. Sure, form can be as crucial as content... but materiality as a dominant mode of thinking threatens to let form obscure content as violently as content has often obscured form.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Silversprung's <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/524">entry</a> about an encounter with a fellow student blogger over Thanksgiving break reminded me of two incidents I had over the break.  Since taking this class, everything technology-related reminds me of this class.  If I run across an article about videogames or blogging or anything remotely related, I suddenly think of this class.  I'm beginning to get a little creeped out by this, it's literally everywhere! I wonder why I didn't notice these things before.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the first incident.  A good friend of mine writes articles for <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/">Escapist Magazine</a>, a gaming magazine, and I told him about our class.  He got super excited that we were actually learning about ludologists and all the theory behind video games.  When I asked him about his thoughts on the gamer and academic divide, he confirmed a lot of what we'd discussed before.  He said that in his experience, the more time a person spends gaming, the less time they devote to the theory and critique behind the games.  I'd thought that perhaps there could be some kind of harmonious <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/477">interaction</a> between the two areas, but even he thought I was being naive.  Hmm...I still remain hopeful, but I guess reality does make it hard to achieve.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I found <em>The Onyx Project</em> fascinating. A few ideas -- </p>
<p>I doubt it's  vaguely like a matter of replacing film. As story, they don't function anything alike. A normal (itchy word, but I'll leave it) film is based on external story and operates mostly temporally, <em>Memento</em> and some others notably aside. Even the nontemporal stories progress in a very linear manner -- we see scene after scene. Even the time we spend on any given scene is dicatated, as it is not in a book. We've seen something of how tremendously difficult plot has been to accomplish in linked text. I can't imagine that a medium that relies on inevitably temporal sound and action footage would be easier. Imagine what they had to do -- and what they had to NOT do! -- to get the music to work.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Somewhere between listening to the class' reactions to "The Onyx Project" and realizing I was spending the bulk of the time we watched it trying to decide if he was reading a teleprompter (verdict: at least half the time, but he did a really good job of not making it painfully obvious.  Not surprising, though, cuts down on the time they have to pay him for).  I actually spent most of the time watching it trying to figure out exactly what sort of equipment and time frame they were working with.</p>
<p>And I started thinking, huh, this is a visual presentation in which nothing really happens.  Just a big long interview/confession.  Why is it that this can't hold my interest while other works about nothing can.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>To me, the question raised in <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/526">tophat1's post</a> and in class discussion of whether or not The Onyx Project could and should be in a more linear, movie format seems contradictory to the project itself.  As much as the it previously annoyed me that The Onyx Project is so opposed to being called a movie (as tophat1 points out, there is clearly a camera, and they show it; as we discussed in class, there is background music, which is a part of the editing process; and in one of the in-between scenes where you wait to click on something, it shows David Strathairn bent over and staring at papers, which I took to be a script), I think I'm beginning to see why the creators were so adamant about its naming.  The point of the project, as I see it, is to redefine the way we look at media.  In other words, asking why it isn't a linear movie is like asking why Michael Joyce's "Afternoon" isn't a linear, print book.  On some level, I think this is a valid question, because the format of "Afternoon" confused me, and I wanted to see it in "book" form; similarly, The Onyx Project isn't my favorite, and I was often bored or anxious from seeing and hearing such scripted, dry speeches from David Strathairn (sorry, KF : )).  But I think the point of both of these projects is that they want to use new media opportunities to move away from traditions of the past and create a new way of storytelling.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>A point made by Hayles and others this semester, that other people in the class seem to have a better handle on than I do, was brought up briefly today: that of how hypertexts change and become something new when they are released to the world.</p>
<p>This has suddenly become a very real concern to me in designing my final project.  One of the major components of my project is a blog which I set up on a public forum.  I didn't really think about comments when I set it up, assuming that the chances were low that a random person would stumble on it and really take time with it before it was done, but today I got my first comment, and it was extremely disturbing.  This reader took my fictional characters and the fictional situations I put them in to be real, and commented accordingly.  Expressing hope for their future and wishing a character luck in a specific venture.  He also made the point of how much he had come to enjoy the main character through reading his blog.</p>

In other words, we could see what the speaker was thinking (in the form of the color pictures at the bottom of the screen) while he was talking about something else.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, it seemed that others saw the process as something akin to an interview or a real-life conversation in which, while the speaker was talking, the viewer could "interrupt" and choose to "ask" him to speak about something else.  By clicking on the pictures, the viewer can prompt another line of conversation.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>As I re-read <em>Walking Mornings</em> for this afternoon's class, I realized that, ironically, my own relationship to this text has been similar to my relationships with hypertexts.  It's ironic because in this essay, Joyce is trying to distance himself from the new technologies, like hypertexts, that he has been so involved in.</p>
<p>Now that I look back on it, reading this essay for the first time felt somewhat hypertextual, largely because of the recursive nature of the text, which hovers around and returns repeatedly to the sentence "I walk mornings" in exploring the different meanings encapsulated by those three words.  It is, as Joyce says, a meditation, and in its lack of a clear linear progression, it resembles hypertext narratives.</p>
