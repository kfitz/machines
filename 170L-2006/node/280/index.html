    <div class="content"><p>In her comment on <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/273">thisismycheese</a>'s post, <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/273#comment-445">Zoey</a>  quotes Henry Jenkins' blog, in which he says, "When Espen Aarseth and I sat down together a few years ago at the HumLab, we found that there was relatively little to debate. We were involved in disagreements in emphasis but not in a substantive dispute about the future of game studies." </p>
<p>This quotation got me thinking about the nature of non-face-to-face communication in general.  I don't know about you guys, but I find that the conversations I have with people over the phone are qualitatively different from the conversations I have with people in person.  And this is true whether I'm talking with my mom (as was the case this afternoon) or conducting an informational interview with someone I've never met or heard speak before (as was the case this morning.)</p>
<p>A large part of what gets lost in telephone communication is body language, of course.  When you're talking to someone face-to-face and you pause to think about something, they can see you put your hand on your chin, or look upwards, or purse your lips, or various other visual cues that let them know you're mulling over something they just said.  Over the phone, when you're thinking, you either choose to indicate that in the same way that you would if you were face-to-face, in which case an awkward silence ensues, or to make an aural cue-- a "hmm...", for instance-- that is probably unnatural or forced, but at least indicates to the other person why you aren't talking.</p>
<p>I find that the lack of visual cues in telephone communication also makes for a lot more misunderstandings over the phone between, for example, my family and me than happen when we're in the same room.  And I think that this problem becomes even more serious when we don't even have sounds to go on-- when we're writing to other people.  In writing, not only do we not have body language, we don't have intonation or pauses or emphases, either.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the difficulties posed by non-face-to-face communication are no less present when two scholars are disagreeing with each other through academic papers than when I'm talking with or writing to my family.  Jenkins and Aarseth appeared to have major intellectual disagreements with each other, but when they actually sat down and hashed things out, it turned out that they differed only in emphasis, not in any fundamental way in which they were looking at games and game studies.</p>
<p>So maybe scholarly disputes aren't always as major as they seem to be.  Certainly at many of the lectures and debates I've attended at Pomona, I have expected strong disagreements between the participants, but the differences in opinion turn out to be relatively subtle.  This could be because people tend to soften their positions when others are actually interrogating their ideas, but I think it's also because communication technologies make it seem like there are greater differences between us than there actually are.</p>
<p>So will videoconferencing eliminate this problem?  Or is there something special about not just visual and auditory cues, but actual close physical proximity, that affects our ability to communicate with and understand each other?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>But it does have to do with non- face-to-face communication.  I <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/72">posted</a> a long time ago on the telephone as a linking tool, but I didn't really ever come to any conclusions on how such a mediated-relationship works.  </p>
<p>I've been reading a lot about this stuff for my term paper (yes I'm uncreative).  There's a heck of a lot of theory about all this stuff, and here's something I ran across recently in (an excitingly titled book) <cite>Electronic Discourse</cite>:</p>
<p>"Electronic communication, written on keyboards and read on computer screens, has many characteristics of both speaking and writing.  Like telephone conversations, it is transmitted by a technology that replaces face-to-face communication, in the case of the telephone conversation with voices speaking and in the case of electronic discourse with images on a screen.  Like letters, electronic discourse is supported by a delivery system that replaces face-to-face communication with writing that stands in place of voices.  As a consequence, electronic discourse is writing that very often reads as if it were being spokenâ€”that is, as if the sender were writing talking" (Davis &amp; Brewer, 2).</p>
<p>Further, "...the discourse cannot be analyzed only or primarily by the methods used for the analysis of conversation becauseâ€”aside from being unspokenâ€”electronic discourse is asynchronic.  It has a different kind of immediacy of feedback or response.  That is, interactivity is delayed: the time between the creation of text between sender and responder may range anywhere from several seconds to several weeks, or even longer, depending on the length of time that the conference is available to participants"  (Davis &amp; Brewer, 2-3).</p>
<p>D&amp;B here are arguing that electronic communication forms some middle ground between speech and writing--that you have elements of both--immediacy and abstraction simultaneously.  I don't know if that will harm or enhance communication between people (or even if their claim is valid).  Just think of the nightmares created by AIM.  But it definitely creates a whole new genre of communication, no?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Why would academic arguments be any different?</p>
<p>Some of us have different preferences, probably based on cognitive styles. I know people who feel comfortable on the phone. I don't. I feel a bit lost without the visual cues. On the other hand, I feel quite at home in email, perhaps because I have the opportunity to examine the language minutely. </p>
<p>I suspect I'm in the minority in this.</p>
