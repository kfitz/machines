    <div class="content"><p>I'd be interested in hearing about more examples of very immersive books or games in which form calls attention to itself or that mix game and narrative. I'm not yet familiar with the examples mentioned in class, so I'm having trouble refining the idea. </p>
<p>Here's what I have so far. </p>
<p>1) We find games that involve less aspects of narrative to be more immersive.<br />
2) We find narratives that involve less aspects of gameplay to be more immersive. </p>
<p>Apparently, exceptions exist. An examination of how these exceptions mix the two might show much of how each and both operate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I suspect that stories and games become less immersive as they blend because the two forms relate to perceived reality in conflicting ways. Stories represent perceived reality. Games do not.  In the sense that I mean this, it's not less true of fanciful stories or photorealistic games. No one asks whether baseball is more or less realistic than football. Chess and even go are often supposed to be representative of war, but having played both for years, I don't see how. Computer games create worlds that involve extensive representation of familiar elements, but I'd argue that insofar as the user plays a game, the representational elements' primary function is to intuitively establish game rules. That is, if one sees a wall, one realizes that an obstacle exists without having to check the manual. In many RPG's, when one sees a bottle or a drumstick, that represents some capacity one can gain for one's avatar. Representational elements contribute to crucial semantics of play in ways that create a different world. The play world is not true or false, but different. Conversely, critics and readers reduce the fluffiest romance or the most unsubstantiated scifi to basic human desires and conflicts, however stylized. And we can talk extensively about particular nuances in the way the story is or is not authentic or truthful. </p>
<p>This basic opposition should create a constant opposition in the ways the forms operate, and some tension when they operate together (vague and sweeping, I know, but this is as far as I've gotten). Narratives involve multiple time because they represent. In a representation, we have at the very least one representation and one represented. So a narrative has a sequence of events that are retold, and a sequence in which the story may be told. It also has a narrator and what's narrated, so the event that's represented as a point of view automatically included. These distinctions and complexities go on and on in narrative and create much of the interest of the form, as the reader passes through the various halls of mirrors comparing real and fictional worlds. These events don't exist at all in a game of go or chess. One may extrapolate from such a game and make some kind of analogies with the outside world, but these extrapolations stand outside the playing of the game itself, whereas such extrapolations give fiction most or all of its passion. </p>
<p>However, the temptation -- no, let me say the motive -- for litcritical discussion of gameplay gets pretty strong for a hypertext author dealing with questioning readers and critics. "There is no simple way to say this" Joyce repeats. And I have to believe he meant to make a meaningful statement in <em>Afternoon</em>, which, after all, conforms to the Aristotelian unities better than does <em>Othello</em>, and maintains simple, straightforward diction throughout. Yet one confronts the interface much as one confronts a game. Readers want to find or avoid one or another body of text, so they develop a strategy to do so. When they're searching for details of the accident, they're very much involved in what appears to be the intentional structure of the tale. Yet to do so effectively, they must not engage in the kind of suspension of disbelief typical of fiction (one pretends one isn't reading a <em>Moby Dick</em>, but floating on the high seas, argh). To do so would stop them from properly manipulating the materiality of the medium and the structural clues of the story for their own ends. </p>
<p>So while there may be some political reality for ludologists to want to ban literary critics from their playing field, literary critics must take games and gaming into consideration, particularly with regard to electronic forms. So far, computer games have extensively raided literature for ideas and images, but in the long run, literature may have more to get from games than the reverse: The game will not represent the literature, but the literature may represent the game.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Wow, magoo, you've been busy!</p>
<p>There's no way that I can respond to everything in your post, but I think you'll find some interesting perspectives on your idea about specific vs. general aspects of games with respect to literature in this week's theory readings in Hardrip-Fruin.  Here's some stuff that I came across that seemed to shed light on the issue--</p>
<p>Pearce, in particular, takes up your question when she discusses game theory.  One of her big claims is that "Games tend to favor abstracted personas over 'developed' characters with clear personalities and motivations.  More abstracted characters leave more room for the player, and are therefore better suited to support a play-centric model" (146).   She, like you, feels that this is one of the big differences between narrative structures and game structures--specifically that while "Empathy/mimesis [an element of classical narratives] requires the development of highly constructed and authored characters with which viewers develop an empathic bond," "Agency [an element of games] creates a container for players to inhabit.  Avatars must by definition have a certain level of ambigiuity in their characters in order to allow the players to transpose or project themselves into them" (Pearce, 147).  This perhaps implies that the types of story-based narratives that we are accustomed to may not be translatable to a game universe.  At the very least, games and narratives function in diametrically opposed ways.</p>
<p>For a more particular examination of narrative, have a look at the J.Yellowlees Douglas and Andrew Hargadon article, in which they suggest that really "involving" narratives function by offering readers "Highly normative schemas."  Such schemas enable the readers to "'lose' themselves in the text in what we might call an 'immersive' affective experience."  I.e. the detective story plot, the pot-boiler, the bildungsroman--we know how the story is supposed to go, so we buy into it and become immersed in the events going on.  This is what you are talking about in narrative--getting involved in the specifics.  It's interesting that the authors believe that it only comes with predictability--anathema to video games.  </p>
<p>However the opposite experience is possible, as Douglas and Haradon go on to say, "in what we might term the 'engaged' affective experience, contradictory schemas or elements that defy conventional schemas tend to disrupt the readers' immersion in the text, obliging them to assume an extratextual perspective on the text itself, as well as on the schemas that have shaped it and the scripts operating within it" (196).  So, unpredictability breaks up the reading experience--it makes us more aware of the text and less aware of the story--this isn't necessarily bad, it's just a differnt experience from the first.  However, unpredictabilty has the opposite effect in games--it tends to engage us in the game and make us less aware of the 'mediation' going on...</p>
<p>Okay, so this is just to sort of push your conversation on a bit further (and/or make this page really, really, really long!).  But I guess I should recap my ideas, because they've grown quite long and thus a bit scattered.  In short, these guys from our readings seem to suggest that:<br />
(1) narratives and games are trying to do two profoundly opposed things, and therefore can't be judged in the same way and<br />
(2) one aspect of this difference is reflected in the inherent differences between the way characters are produced for narratives vs. games, while another aspect is the (un)desirability of predictabile schemas.</p>
<p>So, how do those two ideas (from two different perspectives) affect your thinking on the question?</p>
