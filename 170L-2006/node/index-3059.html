    <div class="content"><p>When I read Burnett's article, I kept thinking about the millions of movies I've seen in which robots take over the human world and wreck havoc on us.  I was reminded of films like "I, Robot" (a movie which I've never actually seen but apparently involves robots taking over the world) and the "Star Wars" series.  Hollywood seems to enjoy portraying robots as dangerous creatures with the power to destroy their own human creators.</p>
<p>Burnett also brings up the power struggle between humans and machines. He says there's a "'natural' and negative 'gut' reaction to the idea that machines may have more power than humans do." (123) I wonder, though, if this fear of technology and machines' "power" is a bit over-exaggerated and silly.  Yes, computers are powerful, but they're only powerful because humans gave them that power. Yes, a computer beat Garry Kasparov during a game of chess, but it was humans who programmed the computers to calculate in the first place.  I am also unclear--and pretty skeptical--as to the usefulness of the debate about machines threatening human individuality.  Perhaps I'm simplifying the situation too much, but to be perfectly frank, I often have a hard time figuring out why people like Burnett are just so fixed on anthropomorphizing machines. I see machines as machines.  When he asks questions like "Can a machine feel pain?"(126) I am not sure at all how to answer his question.  I even wonder, "Is he seriously asking this question?!" WHY is he asking this?  Perhaps I am too practical a person and cannot use my imagination.  Then again, my other cynical side tells me that humans are just egotistical and obsessed with themselves and therefore must attribute human qualities to everything.  An annoyingly frustrating endeavor, in my opinion...</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Bush's article begins with a list of reasons why science and technology is beneficial.  It's funny to me yet completely understandable that sometimes we have to remind ourselves why new technology and scientific research is important.  I think one of the main reasons we need these reminders is because of the fear of new technology.  As Burnett says, "Machines attract and repel humans" (123).  One of these fears relates to our McLuhan discussion, and that is the disappearance of technology from our consciousness through immediacy.  Burnet asks: "What happens, however, when machines disappear from 'view' into the background and nevertheless retain their importance?" (123).  As Burnett says, machines now function with extreme importance in our society, yet they are so important that they pose a danger that the "assumption, if not the reality, that humans no longer control their own destiny" (123).  On one hand, we hope that computers can do more than just what people program them to do, yet there is also great danger in their "intelligence."</p>

It's written by Michael Berube, who is a professor of English at Penn State and writes one of the blogs that Professor Fitzpatrick has included in our blogroll.  I noted that Berube's blog was not mentioned in the author's biography at the bottom of the article.</p>
<p>In this piece, Berube argues that although there are indeed many more liberal than conservative college professors (the ratio is something like 3 to 1), this is not because liberal academics are trying to keep conservative academics out of their departments, as conservatives like David Horowitz maintain.  Berube tries to explain this ratio by suggesting that the applicant pool for arts and humanities professorships probably has the same 3 to 1 liberal to conservative ratio (and thereby insinuating  that there's something about conservative beliefs that makes one less likely to want to be an academic in the arts or humanities.  But Berube never actually says this, so he doesn't have to defend it.  Clever.)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>At the end of her piece, "How Novels Think," Armstrong claims that "the novel of course was not made to think beyond the individual, but neither, on the other hand, was it made to reproduce the status quo."  In the previous sections, she outlines the history of the novel and it's tension between individual and "other."  In her description of late nineteenth-century novels she refers to a gruesome scene from "She" (which I have not read) in which the hero stumbles across a pit of skeletons piled atop one another and described in painful detail.  Armstrong seems to take issue with these descriptions because they portray the destruction of the individual. She believes the pile of bodies represents a sort of collective consuming the individual.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I found the Burnett piece kind of odd as he seemed to be asking lots of questions, and then skipping onto another idea-- where he found more questions to ask. Yet, very little was resolved. But here were a couple of things that I found interesting/alarming:</p>
<p>"In the life sciences and many disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, images are still talked about as if they had specifiable effects. The most limiting example of this is the powerful trope of images as purveyors of violence and transparent vistas onto the events of the world" (xvii). I understand Burnett's point here: allowing images to be only records of actual events, frozen in time, and beholden to the past and present certainly doesn't match up with how he discusses images (or how he defines them in the following page). But this point also reminded me of the way that politicians and interest groups use the "power" of images to advance agendas about how the media should be controlled. I'm talking about the shit-show that followed the Columbine shootings and concerns that music and violent images incite violence in teens. This made me think about different ways that images can be viewed (or even thinking back to McLuhan where the medium is the message) and how that will have repercussions for the way that traditional (and untraditional) images are controlled. The sort of stuff that Burnett discusses (particularly the growing autonomy of machines and the blurry lines between biology and machines) is kind of scary and I can see future parties or political organizations trying to limit the creation of, or access to these sorts of hybrids in an attempt to protect impressionable groups.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This post has been festering for a while, and the germ of it came out of <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/40">Pimm's</a> conclusion to a post on Ong: "I hope these thoughts and questions made as much sense in my writing as they do in my head!"  My thoughts usually don't, or at least they don't make nearly the same sort of "sense" as the one they had before I translated them into writing.  My thoughts are generally not scripted--rarely do they occur as a linear stream of words, ready to be spoken or written down.  Instead, they tend to take shape as a simultaneous barrage of images and sensory impressions that I then have to sift, order, and translate into sound-images that are renderable in speech or text.  Apparently, this classifies me as a <a href="http://www.nswagtc.org.au/ozgifted/conferences/SwordVisualSpatial.html">"visual spatial learner"</a>.  What this means for my reading of Ong is twofold.  On the one hand, I think that he couldn't be more right when he tells his reader that "technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior tranformations of conscious, and never more than when they affect the word" (81).  Words absolutely transform my consciousness, and that's part of why I'm an English major; they have a texture, an artifactual thingness that is fascinating to play with.  On the other hand, I find that Ong's presumed internality of language and script bear out in disturbing ways.</p>

One of the key differences between these media, of course, was that a blog or another form of internet writing was usually interactive, in that users could comment on the blog and question it, and that a book cannot really be questioned.  </p>

I dropped it a couple of months ago, so now it takes about ten hours to charge, and I have to remove and reinsert the battery in order to get it to turn on.  But I wouldn't give up the thing.  I lived for six months last spring in Germany and Austria, and the hardest part was how unreachable I became to my family.  I think I talked to my twin twice over the phone in that space--and here at school we talk ritually every Sunday night.  I felt like I had lost my family, become divorced from a piece of myself, when I had to rely on Skype, calling cards, and freezing public phonebooths to communicate home.</p>
