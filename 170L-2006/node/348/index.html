</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>The question that <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/347">black lace</a> brought up of whether stickers are art or graffiti reminded me of a project someone did at Pomona two years ago.  Someone thought it would be really clever to post stickers that said "SIGN" on them on any kind of sign they could find.  They didn't just put them on paper signs, though-- they stuck some to walls and doors and other places from which stickers are very difficult to remove.  </p>
<p>Now, not only did it fall to the Housekeeping Department to scrape all of these obnoxious stickers off of Pomona College property, but the people who posted the stickers didn't draw a distinction between College property and individuals' private property.  Which meant that several postcards and other handmade, irreplaceable, personal things I had posted on my door got "SIGN" stickers slapped on them.  I was livid.  The gall some one must possess to believe that he has the right to deface my property or the College's property (that someone else will have to clean up) in order to accomplish an intellectually not-that-interesting project amazes me.  And that's what really got my goat in <em>Implementation</em>.  Not the story itself-- I really enjoyed the actual story-- but the part in which Samantha talks about her alleged ambivalence regarding the work involved in removing the stickers she makes and posts struck me as so unbelievably narcissistic.  Here's what she says:</p>
<p>"Yes I feel divided about the labor involved in removing my stickers from the walls.  The janitor, the super, the maid-- they did nothing to deserve this.  Their occupations are otherwise intended.  And yet-- and yet-- well, it's a distraction from their usual routine.  A moment of strangeness to break up the workday.  I hope they don't hate me.  I think of them.  I think of their scrapers, peeling away my art, and I love them."</p>
<p>Samantha gets to feel like she's doing the rest of us a favor by injecting "strangeness" into our days.  But what if we think her stickers lack artistic and creative merit?  What if this is what the janitors think who have to scrape them away?  Then Samantha's not doing anybody any favors.  Furthermore, even if a sticker were interesting, it would probably be interesting for a brief moment.  Maybe the strangeness would last 30 seconds.  45, tops.  But it takes a heck of a lot longer than 45 seconds to scrape a sticker off a wall while trying to minimize the damage to the surface it's stuck to.  So I don't know how Samantha (or her real-life counterpart at Pomona, whoever that was) can have the guts (or willful blindness) to argue that their "art" is actually for the good of everyone.  I don't buy it for a second.  It smacks of utterly vapid intellectual and creative elitism.  </p>
<p>Man, that sounded really angry.  I guess I just get really upset when people think that they are above following the basic rules of human decency and respect that everyone is obligated to follow.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Frabby on 4 November 2006 - 12:58pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I understand why no one would want their personal stuff irreparably damaged by stickers, but I think you've gone a bit too far in condemning the stickers in Implementation. I liked the story, and I think the stickers have enough merit to be posted in inconvenient places. I think it's okay that somebody has to clean them off eventually, and that that clean-up time doesn't really merit being called a violation of human decency. Also, by acknowledging that someone does have to clean it up, I don't think Samantha is really being ambivalent. Instead, she offers a bit of remorse.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>But that remorse is not on every sticker, not everyone who has to remove them gets to have this "apology" (which is think is rather self-important--"it's going to be work for you to deal with my mess, but I think my mess is more valuable than your time and energy).  And have you ever tried to remove a sticker?  It's a royal pain, and in my experience incurs nothing but cursing and (incredibly creative) ill wishes.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I guess we could agree to disagree, Frabby.  Although Samantha *says* that she's somewhat remorseful, by the end of her explanation, it seems clear that she really thinks that she's doing janitors (and the rest of us) a favor.  So I think her remorse is fake.  </p>
<p>And I really do think that it's disrespectful toward the people who have to clean something up to say, "Oh, it's art, and you should be grateful for the opportunity to scrape it off a wall."  That strikes me as very selfish.  I mean, one of the things that's drilled into every child's head is: if you make a mess, you have to clean it up.  I doubt any parent or teacher would be amused if the mess-maker replied, "But it's art.  If you have a problem with it, then you clean it up."  I realize that the situation isn't identical with adults who think of themselves as artists, but I think the basic principle still holds.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Lulu on 5 November 2006 - 2:01am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>On the one hand, if I ever do see sticker art around with an interesting or thought-provoking message, I'll think it's worth my time to stop and read it and get something out of it.  On the other hand, I also always get angry because of many of the very valid points that you've made.  I totally agree with you. I think the narcissism and elitism that you mention is very true in a lot of these cases, and what irks me is the artists' lack of responsibility and inconsiderate attitudes, as well as lack of sincerity.  I would be more friendly towards the sticker art if the artists took the initiative to take down their own mess, to scrape off all that glue and stickiness with their own hands, to polish and reshine the surface on which they plastered their work with their own labor, rather than forcing someone else to do it.  And I feel like sometimes it's not enough to merely say one sympathizes; if Samantha really "loved" the janitors and maids, she would not have pasted stickers in the first place.  She's creative, I'm sure there were a million other ways to get one's artistic message across.</p>
<p>To me, it's always seemed like a matter of privilege.  The artists can choose to do sticker art; they can choose to potentially leave a sticky mess.  The janitors or housekeepers who have to clean up afterwards don't have that choice.  I mean, one could argue that this is their job and that they're paid to clean up, but I don't think that gives anybody at all--whether they're an artist or not--license to litter more, graffiti more, or just make more of a mess in general.  Plus, artistic value is also a relative judgment, so it feels elitist that something would be "worthy" enough to make others bear the burden of cleanup.  And what about language?  Not everyone is literate in English or whatever other language of the sticker art...so who is the audience? If I speak another language, does this English-language piece of art mean anything to me at all? Will I gain anything from it, or is it just a piece of paper that I will have to clean up?  </p>
<p>This is also why I'm also bothered by the MUFTI stickers.  The glue that they use is ridiculously heavy-duty.  The messages in themselves are supposed to be witty and insider, a sense that they know what's going on around campus.  I think it embodies a lot of the creative elitism that you also mentioned.  </p>
<p>So yeah, I totally agree with you, silversprung, and I do not think it's okay to forget common decency.  I just wish that those people who put those SIGN posters up or the MUFTI people know that if they themselves would not like the job of cleaning up a mess, then probably another person wouldn't like it either.  It's common decency, and artistic "value" really shouldn't make us forget that.  Just my 2cents.</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-524" class="active">what about if it isn&#039;t just</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 5 November 2006 - 5:37pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>what about if it isn't just art work--if it's a political message?  </p>
<p>I was in Vienna last year, and that was a common way of starting commentary on political events--you stuck a sticker up on a lamp post, the U-bahn, the light box.  I remember when George Bush came--there were a lot of stickers (in german of course) reading: "A Mass Murderer Comes to Wien".  Now THAT got people talking! :)</p>
<p>One really good example came as a response to the upcoming elections, in which an extremely racist, neo-Nazist party was expected to win quite a lot of seats.  No one would admit to being part of the party or that they were considering voting for them outright--but there was a huge, silent system underground support, even in "multicultural Austria."  Anyway, In all of the subways they have stickers on the escalators that read "stand right, please!" (i.e. you stand on the right so that people in a hurry... like me !... can get around you on the left).  Someone put up a whole bunch of absolutely identical stickers that said "think left, please!" up over them.   Lots of people didn't notice them right off--they looked identical--but once they did, they became the number one topic of conversation.  These stickers finally brought the topic out of the closet, so to speak.</p>
<p>So, I've seen stickers work in strange ways, and I wonder if your aversion to Samantha's stickers has to do with the vandalism aspect or the peceived "superfluousness" of their content?</p>

<p>And graffiti art that is commissioned by someone for a building, sign, mural, etc. is something else entirely, because it's often really visually interesting, and of course is not vandalism, so I usually enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 8 November 2006 - 2:26pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>it's grown on me.  I used to be really turned off by it--vandalism, destructive, etc--but then (jeez I feel like such a study abroad junkie ;)!) I really began to appreciate it as protest art when I lived in Berlin. I was there for two months, and the Berlin Wall was and still existed as a political document--the graffiti that covered it was the history of the wall, of the city, of the post-wwII and post-cold war periods. To do it just to vandalize isn't cool... but then there's this aspect of being a historical-political document that I really appreciate.</p>
