    <div class="content"><p>I'm in early stages of preparing an online edition of Emily Dickinson's <em>Fascicles</em>. (The Fascicles were the little booklets in which Dickinson bound much of her verse). </p>
<p>I wonder how you would prefer to see such a document. Here are the problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Her nonstandard punctuation changes the meaning of her text.</li>
<li>Even her handwriting is critical in these changes </li>
<li>Her handwriting is very hard for most people to read.</li>
<li>People have tried to transcribe the handwriting in such a way that the visual qualities of the punctuation are preserved. No one has come close.</li>
<li>The effort of deciphering the immediate visuality of the poetry tends to detract from the resonance of the longer sequence of poems</li>
<li>Believe it or not, no print version exists that maintains the poems in print except for <em>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</em>, which wonderfully and terribly requires readers to decipher Dickinson's handwriting</li>
</ul>
<p>What I'm thinking at present is that I should provide an HTML rollover icon that stays uniformly onscreen that allows users to select which fascicle and which poem to go to. </p>
<p>I'm thinking that each page could be laid out visually as a scan or digital photo of the original itself (when and if I could actually arrange permission for such a thing). When the user drags the cursor over any given word in ED's precious scrawl, the word would appear as simple typographic text. </p>
<p>The technology would be fairly easy. (XHTML image maps tied to JavaScript rollovers, CSS-generated rollover menus from the icons). </p>
<p>Does this seem like the easiest and/or most productive design?</p>
<p>Someone seems to have done something somewhat similar with <em><a href="http://www.uky.edu/AS/English/Beowulf/eBeowulf/main.htm">The Electronic Beowulf</a></em>.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by silversprung on 18 September 2006 - 7:56pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I took a course on Whitman and Dickinson last year, and one of our assignments was to prepare a 'reader's edition' of around 10 of Dickinson's poems.  Our editions had to include an editor's note that explained why we made the choices we did in displaying Dickinson's poems.  The text of my editorial note is below.  </p>
<p>Before I copy and paste (oh, woe is mine technological ineptitude!) my Dickinson philosophy, I want to suggest that if you do decide to go with the word-by-word rollover idea, magoo, that you make sure that somewhere on your site you include a full typed version of each of Dickinson's poems.  As a reader, I would find it very frustrating to only be able to decipher one typed word at a time, and then have that typed word disappear as soon as I moved my cursor to another of Dickinson's illegible manuscript words.</p>
<p>(p.s. On a somewhat sour note, I'm pretty sure that Harvard University owns the rights to all of Dickinson's poems (not sure if this includes her manuscripts, but I'm inclined to think it does) and almost never allows others to use them, because her poems are such huge money-makers for them.)</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>My editorial philosophy on Dickinson, and apologies to those who have no interest in this:</p>
<p>"This readerâ€™s edition of Emily Dickinsonâ€™s poetry consists of 10 poems that are arranged according to R.W. Franklinâ€™s chronological dating of Dickinsonâ€™s work.</p>
<p>My central editorial principle for this project has been to preserve as much of the original character of Dickinsonâ€™s manuscripts as I can while still ensuring that the quirks of Dickinsonâ€™s manuscripts do not overshadow the poems themselves.</p>
<p>To this end, I have decided to print the poems metrically, rather than replicate the exact way the rows of print appear on the manuscript page.  If a row of print breaks, but not metrically, I assume that Dickinson went on to a new row of print because she came to the edge of the page, and I do not break the line.  However, for the curious reader, I have included at the bottom of each poem these places where Dickinson starts a new row of print, but my reprinting does not.  A single vertical line indicates a line break; double vertical lines indicate both a line break and a page break.</p>
<p>I have chosen to abide by Franklinâ€™s interpretation of Emily Dickinsonâ€™s handwriting, given that he is far more familiar with it than I am.  If he believed that a certain word was capitalized, I have kept that word capitalized in my edition.  I have also left Dickinsonâ€™s spelling, grammar, and punctuation the way they appear on the manuscript page; there is no good justification for standardizing them.  As Franklin notes at the end of his introduction to The Poems of Emily Dickinson (2003), â€œIf the orthography, capitalization, punctuation, and usage should seem problematical, they are nonetheless Dickinsonâ€™s, not the editorâ€™s or the publishers, not, except indirectly, societyâ€™sâ€”agents with whom she conducted no negotiation toward public norms for her poetry.â€</p>
<p>However, I have decided to not attempt to typographically represent the different lengths, slants, and positions of her dashes.  No typographical transcription, no matter how complicated, will accurately preserve the character of Dickinsonâ€™s handwriting.  If it is important to a particular reader to see Dickinsonâ€™s actual writing, that reader should simply go to the manuscript itself.  </p>
<p>When multiple full manuscripts exist for a single poem, I have published the latest version, giving editorial power to Dickinson rather than myself.  When the manuscripts include variants for vocabulary, I keep the word that Dickinson chose in the latest manuscript, but I also include the variants for this manuscript at the bottom.  I believe that the inclusion of alternative word choices is intellectually valuable for students of literary analysis as well as for a general audience.  If Dickinson has provided more than one alternative for a particular word, I separate the alternatives with an asterisk.  I have decided not to provide variants that appear only in earlier manuscripts of a particular poem because I do not think it would warrant the confusion it would cause the reader.  </p>
<p>I have noted additional line breaks, variant words, and other relevant manuscript notes at the bottom of each poem; this is my attempt to provide helpful information but ensure that it does not overly distract the reader from the experience of reading the poem.  Above all, I believe it is important for the reader to enjoy reading Dickinsonâ€™s poetry.  If an editor produces a readerâ€™s edition that is informative but confusing or distracting, that editor has not done justice to Dickinsonâ€™s poems."</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>As to including a print version, point well taken. One could click from it to the facsimile page and vice versa. </p>
<p>I agree with some parts of your approach to ED (what a cool assignment!) but disagree with others:</p>
<p>1) I absolutely would NOT assume that she broke the lines because the page ends where the lines are "not metrical." I realize you're in good company, but she so often wrote smaller letters to squeeze words in, then expanded letters on other lines -- even on the same pages where she dropped part of what one might think of as a line.<br />
   I take her to be totally intentional in all this. I could be wrong, but it's certainly not obvious, given the furor. Wouldn't the safer path be to follow her breaks, and if it's so clear that they should be different for some reason, the reader to whom that seems so obvious can make that judgment.<br />
   (BTW, I don't find them less metrical with the odd breaks , but much the opposite. The breaks seem necessary to preserve rythmn against the profuse, insistent, and irregular punctuation.)</p>
<p>2) I'll nod to Franklin's take on letters, too, although I can't say I'm comfortable about it. He's at least as good as I am, though, probably way better. I find it tough.</p>
<p>3) I have tried to "typographically represent the different lengths, slants, and positions of her dashes." I failed miserably, over and over. I nod to your judgment here, much chagrined and disappointed. </p>
<p>4) Using the later version, even assuming dates to be correct, hardly means ceding to Dickinson's choice, given all the things she did with context. Sometimes this resolves nicely, sometimes not. </p>
<p>Thanks for the advice. I realize copyright's likely to be an impassible point. I'd need permission to re-photograph the originals. So I've for present stopped work at the point where I have the object I'll need to use myself -- a typographical version hypertext that maintains poem sequence and alternative wordings: something that's not otherwise available anywhere that I've found. (The online Dickinson Archive is cool, but priviledges the sequence of correspondence, probably because of Nell Smith's theories about ED's relationship with Susan.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I reckon that taken in sequence -- with alternate readings, line breaks, punctuations, and reader-specific versions in circulation -- the fascicles form something very related to hypertext. But, perhaps ironically, one needs to read the individual booklets in smooth-ish sequence to get the resonances.</p>
