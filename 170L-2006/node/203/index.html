    <div class="content"><p>Every time I start trying to write down my messy thoughts about this material, I find that what I'm writing quickly turns negative in tone. Maybe this is because the thoughts are messy; I wouldn't exactly be the first person to not really like what I don't really understand. On the other hand, maybe there's a reason for my inherent, if mild, antipathy toward this stuff, and maybe that reason is informative.</p>
<p>In class and on the blog, we have definitely identified the resistance that the electronic literature we've encountered seems to have toward conventional readability. The theorists seem to regard this resistance as a virtue, while we have been considerably more suspicious. And justifiably so, I think. Here we've spent a few years learning to be increasingly serious about literature, and suddenly we're reading stuff that seems... hokey. Seems to rely on preciousness, fireworks and formal conceit. </p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if maybe I'm just being aesthetically overconservative. Always skulking around is the argument that there's a long list of important writers whose achievements were met with ambivalence or disdain during their lifetimes. Some of their achievements were no doubt formal leaps. This seems to paint our current frustration as something we ought to be able to see past.</p>
<p>What seems to be one of the big arguments for the virtue in the formal difficulty of reading some electronic literature is the way this resistance highlights the mediating nature of the text. But it seems to me that a James Joyce does every bit as well as a Michael Joyce in indicating the mediating nature of text. And the former Joyce's pages always turn at your damn command. </p>
<p>So is it this related notion of "materiality," as proposed by Hayles, that is truly at issue? Does the electronic format lend itself in some essential way to texts that resist standard modes of reading? If so, the frustration many of us seem to feel with the electronic lit we've read is a desired effect, the planned result of a new technique that may prove vital. Now it seems that this is a feeling not to see past, but rather to <em>see</em>.</p>
<p>At this point what I'm choosing to hope is that writers of electronic literature rapidly achieve more and more nuance in their formal techniques of resistance and frustration. So the e-authors can keep me from getting to where I want to go in the text, or from reading it cleanly. Wonderful. I think that the examples we've seen of these techniques are certainly thought-provoking and worthwhile. But they're not surprising and beautiful in the same way as the print literature with which we more voluntarily struggle. We've been made to see something by the characteristics of e-lit, but we haven't yet been clued in as to why we should care. Which will happen, and which I'm sure will happen on an increasingly large scale. Exciting... but it would seem that there are many headaches in store for us if the road to beauty is paved with frustration.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 11 October 2006 - 8:35am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Don't you think that all new art requires some sort of "breaking in" period?  Our minds need to become acclimatized to something new, wrap themselves around it, before they can appreciate it and find it beautiful/engaging/artistic?  I think this idea was even floated in some of our readings--the Burnett, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>It takes awhile, I know.  People are always a bit slow.  James Joyce was reviled for years--<cite>Ulysses</cite> didn't get released in America until the thirties--twenty years after it's initial publication.  People just didn't believe that his writing was literature.</p>
<p>Or Stravinsky is perhaps an even better example.  The first performance of <cite>The Rite of Spring</cite> incited a riot in Paris.  It was too modern--too percussive--the dancing was too wild and bacchanalian--over all, just too alien for the French musical audience.  Seven years later it was re-performed, and the  people of Paris carried Stravinsky out of the theater on their shoulders, declaring he was a musical genius.</p>
<p>I don't know what we'll be doing to Michael Joyce seven years from now.  We're also not French.  But perhaps we need that sort of time--our brains demand that sort of time--to internalize and come to appreciate the very modern.  What is frustrating and opaque now might become exciting and, yes, even appear nuanced in a bit of time.</p>
<p>Sorry to sound so hokey myself ;)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I tried to indicate that I had considered the possibility that I'm just being close-minded. And that may yet be the case, but I hope it doesn't necessarily undermine everything else I wrote. </p>
<p>I also wonder if the particular difficulties of electronic literature are something we should be looking to "break in" or get over. The foregrounding of mediation and materiality seems to rely upon disruption; smooth over this disruption and what will we have accomplished? There seems to be as much to lose as to gain. </p>
<p>And Michael Joyce published afternoon in 1986. Never mind seven, it's been twenty years.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by marmalade on 12 October 2006 - 8:36am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I guess I interpret mediation as "remediation"--subsuming the previous form of media, integrating into it and taking it over.  </p>
<p>And I understand your point about disruption, but I do not agree that the subsuming process of remediation necessarily destroys that sense of disruption.  Rather, disruption exists, but we appreciate the disruption as artistry--we read the fragments that pop up as Joyce "transcribes" Leopold Bloom's mind, and we are disrupted, at times confused, but we do not doubt it's literary merit.  We appreciate what those disruptions imply about both Bloom's and our own experiences of consciousness.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that we get used to disruption--I am suggesting that we need to get over being turned off by disruption.  </p>
<p>The point about Michael Joyce is well taken.  Maybe Stravinsky had the equivalent of more "air time"?</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-338" class="active">I&#039;ve been using &quot;mediation&quot;</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by night owl on 12 October 2006 - 11:10am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I've been using "mediation" just to mean transmission through a medium.</p>
<p>And I think the disruptions we experience in a printed text like Ulysses are fundamentally pretty different from the ones e-lit can offer. For one, the printed page is static. Our reading is disrupted when Joyce neologizes, but it will always be disrupted in the same way through the same passages, which we can choose to reread in an identical arrangement whenever we'd like. The artistry of Joyce's linguistic unreliability hangs upon the reliable framework within which he works, as well as upon his vast talents as a writer. I mean, he more than adequately compensates, in structure and skill, for occasionally leaving his readers confused, effectively allowing us to "get over being turned off by disruption."</p>
<p>On the other hand, take, I don't know, James Patterson, and chop one of his books into tiny little pieces, then display them in some infuriating and unreliable way on the web... and I'm not sure the result would be so worthwhile. We'd be confused, and the disruption would indicate the mediation and materiality of the thing. But, lacking both a cohesive framework (which a typical Patterson book clearly has) and an outstanding author, this chopped-and-screwed work would just be drivel. We'd be turned off, and rightfully so. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm suggesting is that artistic disruption involves some sort of balance, a variety of coherence for each variety of incoherence. It took a James Joyce to pull off Ulysses, and e-lit promises even grander types of disruption. What kind of a talent will it take to make the new forms of disruption cohere without completely effacing them?</p>

    <h3 class="title"><a href="index.html#comment-332" class="active">I also have an ambivalent</a></h3>
  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Lulu on 11 October 2006 - 11:40am.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>I also have an ambivalent attitude towards many forms of modern art, music, and literature.  I wonder, though, if there was a period in which print literature also met much resistance before it got accepted.  I forgot who said this, but one of the authors that we read for this class said that books are technology too, and that they're in no way natural.  Perhaps, long after we've died, electronic literature will be accepted as a medium comparable to books.  For now, though, I share a lot of your views about electronic literature and I'm struggling with comprehending its value.  Maybe we're both just "aesthetically overconservative."</p>
<p>But as far as blogging goes, I think that even if you have an uncertain view towards electronic lit, there's still room to craft your blog however you like.  I feel like it's a nice space to air grievances and frustrations.  I personally get a kick out of the commenting feature too; it helps me realize that I'm not the only one struggling to understand this material.  And this blog gives me a good sense of how people feel towards the readings, technology, etc., and I feel like it's easier to admit frustration and to be honest on here than in class.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by magoo on 14 October 2006 - 5:10pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Well, maybe MJoyce or Shelley Jackson will become more celebrated in a few generations. Maybe not. Either way, I doubt the value or nonvalue of the medium rests on their efforts. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, people wondered whether English was an adequate language for poetry, what with the inchoate variety of its etymologic roots, its near-total lack of rhyming terminations, and barbaric ker-THUMP, kerTHUMP of its iambs that pushed and pulled at otherwise natural line and stanza breaks. Most of us probably feel that question was answered some time back, but would we rest our defense on whether or not someone happened to like Wyatt, who began to write sonnets in English?</p>
