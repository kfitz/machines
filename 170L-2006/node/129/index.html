    <div class="content"><p>Alright. So, I am sheepishly outing myself, tail between legs. I read "afternoon" after class. While I'm not trying to defend myself, it was interesting going into the story already having a preconceived notion of what it was about-ish.</p>
<p>I read a very different story, it feels like, the crash and the possible dead wife and son only popped up...once? Maybe twice? </p>
<p>I really like it. The indecisiveness, the lack of linerality, the inability to decipher whether there was one or multiple narrators, never quite exactly sure how any one character fit in with another, the fascinating interpersonal relationships that developed as a result. I very much saw myself reading my life, my blueprint of interactions with people, onto the story. The lack of coherency, I think, allows the reader to really pick and choose what fits where, how it fits, if it fits, what to disregard. </p>
<p>In a strange sort of way, it kinda reminded me of astrology, or tarot. You're given specifics, details, yet it all remains very vague and it's up to you to put it all together, decide what it means. And depending on what you decide it means, it kinda tells you where your head is, lets you observe your own thought processes.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot in the page titles. And I think the links aren't necessarily always "this was on this page, and now it will lead you here," but some seemed more as if they were labeling where you came from and where you were going, with the page you're on right now not necessarily being terribly important.</p>
<p>I've got a book on my shelf, "the naked i: Fictions for the Seventies." It's a collection of stories and excerpts and non-fiction pieces that play with the notion of narrator. I found it in my parents' basement, the cover's been torn off, my uncle picked it up from discards at the bookstore he worked at as a kid, they tore out the copyright information so that they couldn't try to resell it. It's a cheap 1970s paperback printing, with the yellow glue cracking and dying, the pages discolored, the book smells musty and feels incredibly fragile. It lives in a heavy-duty Ziploc bag. The pages are falling out, I have to be careful when I read from it.</p>
<p>There's a short story in this book, "The Babysitter," by Robert Coover. It strikes me as somewhat of a precursor to the hypertext story. When you read it, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Or it makes too much sense. There are little tidbits, a paragraph or two, perhaps just a line, separated by page breaks. It starts out with a sense of a linear story. An omniscient narrator who jumps between a few locations. But as the story progresses, it starts retelling the same scenes, or similar scenes, or people imagining scenes. The objective narrator is lost, and it's not entirely clear how all the pieces fit together, if they even do fit together.</p>
<p>It blew my mind when I first read it when I was in 9th grade. It seemed so...novel, so avant-garde, so real (so very wearing a beret whilst smoking unfiltered cigarettes in city basement dives). It was like it solved the problem, or at least more valiantly tackled it than most, of trying to truly represent life without artifice. Or so stylize it to the point that it became real again. </p>
<p>I think that's what I loved about "afternoon." The illusion that it really was real. Because, like life, it was fragmented and went back on itself and went on tangents that didn't make much sense, and there wasn't always a linear quality to it, there were just snapshots and possibilities and subjective truths and there was no conclusion, the story just kept going, endlessly, and you never know if you know it all, never know if you truly understand it, ever truly can, and the story won't always be there, never the same way, and could disappear with the aging of it, its technology, its lifesource. But unlike life, you can walk away without consequence. </p>
<p>I think that's what makes it beautiful.</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Anonymous on 27 September 2006 - 5:25pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Cool! I enjoy Joyce's work myself, although I must say I can also relate to much of the frustration that our classmates expressed. </p>
<p>Tarot's a good association -- you have significance, albeit iconic -- that appears in random-ish combinations. Far more random than Joyce, actually.</p>
<p>Did you know that Coover wrote the famous New Yorker (I think it was, or may NY Times Book Review. No, I think it was the Times) article that boldly proclaimed the "end of books" (almost 30 years after Derrida, and a few other people, but there you have it.) I was always waiting for Coover to come out with a hypertext, and it never happened.  </p>
<p>Other cool precursors, IMO: Borges' "The Garden of Forking Paths," Cortazar's <em>Hopscotch</em>. James Joyce's <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, in a sense. There are others. </p>
<p>In a very, very different way, I think that <em>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</em> pieces like Hejinian's <em>My Life</em> are precursors as well.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Cool! Did you know Coover wrote the article (for the NY Times Book Review, I think) declaring the "end to books" in the mid-nineties or so? (Of course, others had made such declarations decades prior, but there was still a fuss. </p>
<p>Tarot's a good connection -- the cards signify variously in various fairly random combinations. I set up a hypertext in  the review <em>Onyx</em> written by Joe Byron that was based pattly on tarot cards (long taken down, I believe).</p>

  <div class="submitted">Submitted by Oz on 1 October 2006 - 11:20pm.</div>
  <div class="content"><p>So I just discovered the <a href="http://eliterature.org/">Electronic Literature Organization</a>, a nonprofit founded in 1999 "to facilitate and promote the writing, publishing, and reading of literature in electronic media."  Robert Coover was one of its three founders.</p>
<p>The website says that the ELO has organized public readings of electronic literature, but I can't seem to find a description of how one would actually go about giving an e-lit reading.  I'm certainly curious.</p>
<p>In any event, the site is definitely worth checking out.  Lots of potentially useful links as far as our class content is concerned.</p>
