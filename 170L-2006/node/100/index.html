    <div class="content"><p>In response to Gunslinger1818's objection to the premise of "How Novels Think": <cite> What if there already was such thing as an individual? Someone please correct me if I'm missing the point, but I feel that there is a problem with causation here. I read the whole thing and can find nowhere in which Armstrong shows that the concept of individualism was not simply a manifestation of society that the novel has mirrored</cite>, and as follow up to our class discussion, here's an attempt to put some perspective on the modern subject--and hence, on Armstrong's potentially outrageous claim that, during the late eighteenth-century, "novels were acquiring the power to endow their readers with individuality" (3)--by giving it a relative framework.</p>
<p>Ong's characterization of the literate subject attempting to come to terms with the notion of orality forms an excellent analogy for the modern individual (i.e., us) trying to grasp an understanding of pre-modern psychology: "We--readers of books such as this--are so literate that it is very difficult for us to conceive of an oral universe of communication of thought except as a variant of a literate universe" (2).  Case in point: I took an English course called "Pre-modern Psychology" last semester, and for my final project I decided to look for antecedents of the modern subject as they appeared in pre-modern literature. (If anyone is interested, there's a fantastically well-written and argued <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tremulous-Private-Body-Subjection-Materialism/dp/0472065521/sr=8-1/qid=1158718215/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-9529992-3633440?ie=UTF8&s=books#citebody">book</a> by Francis Barker on this topic.)  What this turned out to mean was looking for privacy, or the potential for something unscripted, because privacy as we understand it today--as not only a state of physical isolation, but an inherent right to choose to hide oneself from the public eye which, when violated, causes an absolute uproar on the facebook--didn't really exist for the pre-modern psyche.  The Elizabethan social principle was hierarchy, and this principle was supported by all sorts of laws--divine law, the law of nature, civil law, &amp;c.  In this context, ambition was considered to be an incredibly negative attribute because it undermined the natural order of things, whereas in modernity it's viewed as a positive, or at least morally neutral, characteristic.  Because everyone fit into a definitive social category, there was an assumed principle of commensurability; in the pre-modern community, no one was so special or exceptional that they could not be interchanged with someone who shared their position in the hierarchy.  This translates into an emphasis on the superficial, or a belief that what is most essential about a person is immediately and externally recognizable, as opposed to hidden somewhere "inside" the person.  And here's where the psychological implications start to get really crazy: INTERSUBJECTIVITY.  The pre-modern psyche didn't exist all alone, a self-enclosed brain with its self-enclosed thoughts.  That is, if you can get at a person's essence externally, and furthermore, you're basically identical to any of the other courtiers, or farmers, or wives, or retainers, or what have you, then it is entirely possible to gain direct access to another person's thoughts and feelings.  Intersubjectivity is the collapse of psychic boundaries--in "The Pilgrim's Progress" one man can lay down next to another and start dreaming the other man's dream, or Thomas Traherne, in his "Centuries of Meditations", can say that the only route to true happiness is to experience everyone else's happiness in equal measure.</p>
<p>If it sounds like one big psychic orgy, it kind of is.  Because the pre-modern conception of the body was so immediate and vivid there was, in literature, no gap between the plane of signification and representation.  There was no proscenium separating the audience from the performers on the Jacobean stage, and Shakespeare's tragic heroes had to suffer a gruesome physical death because pre-modern death was in and of the body--no modern metaphorical or spiritual death for them.  So when Hamlet desires his "too solid flesh to melt" (I.ii.129) so that he can get at "the heart of [his] mystery" (III.ii.368-9), he is basically requesting modern subjecthood.  And this is the request that Descartes carries out in his "Meditations".  Sitting there, alone in his study, Descartes decides that he must "tear down" all uncertainties, and he winds up with one affirmative thought, which is the existence of his thinking mind, afloat in some sort of black void, bereft of world and body.  So out of that exercise we get mind/body dualism, the image of the modern subject, and all the problems of modern philosophy.  Thanks, Descartes.  This is the divide that guys like Smith and Rousseau are reinforcing when Armstrong explains they do not "[want] to think that our apparent ability to share emotions is owing to the spontaneous spread of feeling from one individual to another" (13).  Mind/body dualism is the reason why Smith, to explain the experience of sympathy, splits the individual into two, spectator and agent (14), and it's the reason that Armstrong makes such a big deal of the collapse between subject and object in the Mackenzie citation on page 16--it's a throwback to pre-modernity, the kind that she claims the novel is attempting to co-opt, or defend itself against.</p>
<p>Finally, what this all means as per our discussion is that yeah, traces of a social structure that has the individual as its basic unit were already there before the incidence of the novel, but they came together in a way that, against all reason, seems highly intersubjective itself.  There was a shared, conjunctive effort and thinking that went into the making of the modern subject.  So I wonder about a project opposite to mine, and it was something we touched on when we talked about Burnett and "How Images Think" on Monday--where, today, do we see the residual (or maybe resurfacing) strains of a visual and interconnected pre-modern consciousness?</p>
