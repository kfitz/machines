    <div class="content"><p>One of Jill Walker's ideas that I sort of struggled with was her claim that blogs could collectively function as a sort of hypertext--collaborating to form an authored work.</p>
<p>I personally think of the authorship question in blogs as stemming from the blogger/commentator relationship--the creation of a text that talks back (think Ong and Plato from the beginning of the year). Walker claims in <cite>Distributed Narrative</cite>that "the story of a weblogger is described is [sic] by the story being told by several different narrators on their independent sites."  She expands a bit more on this in the Feral article, discussing the blog-diarist Justin Hall, specifically her view that his blog could be read as a hypertext through many different lenses.  For instance she claims that "I could choose to limit it by authorship, as Foucault suggests, in which case I would choose to look at everything Hall has written.  Or I could choose to limit by the main character in the narrative, Justin Hall, in which case I would look at his girlfriends' blogs and other writings about him as well."</p>

    <div class="content"><p>This might seem like I am stating the obvious, but is it just me, or does Shelley Jackson seem--in addition to being super interested in bodies, as <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/369">Frabby</a> pointed out--to also be obsessed with puzzles?  It seems like if we were to simplify the concepts behind <em>Skin</em> and <em>Patchwork Girl</em>, then it would seem like Jackson is creating a giant jigsaw puzzle.  </p>
<p>When I first looked at the <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html">frontpage</a> of Skin, I was misled into thinking that her final project was supposed to be presented as a giant collage/puzzle of the people's tattoos.  <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/368">Pimm</a> also linked us to Jackson's tatooed people's <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart">community blog</a>, in which someone mentions that "I am we," which seems like the individual does acknowledge that he or she is like a puzzle piece in a larger collective identity. Not to strip people of their humanity and say that they're/we're all puzzle pieces, but it does seem like Jackson's hinting at this concept with her work.</p>

</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>I finally got a chance to have a look at Winchester's Nightmare just now, and I have to say that I found it to be far more bearable than either Zork or afternoon.</p>
<p>As far as Winchester's status as a hypertext goes, what I appreciated about it was that there is at least an attempt to provide a spatial context for the exploratory kind of reading that the text demands.  Winchester takes as its central conceit that we are exploring the mental space of Sarah Winchester (at least that's how I see it).  As such, the confused, associative way of moving from one scene, one lexia to the next at least makes a certain amount of sense.  For example, you start out on a beach with a seashell in front of you and the way that you actually start the story (probably after some time spent wandering Zork-like to no particular purpose) is to listen to the shell, which the text compares to a rifle shell, and then boom, there you are in an armory.  I'll admit, I didn't just randomly decide to listen to the shell.  The text will give you a hint or a prod every now and then if you get stuck for awhile, which I appreciated.  The beauty of Winchester's premise is that it actually works with the structure of hypertext, rather than being almost incidental to it.  Arguably, afternoon's premise of reconstructing an accident was in harmony with this as well, but Winchester casts you as Sarah Winchester, whereas there is no clear point of entry for the reader in afternoon.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Like Pimm, I've been looking at Jackson's other projects. I was pretty interested in her autobiographical (with lies, as she writes) hypertext <a href="http://www.altx.com/thebody/ ">"My Body."</a> Jackson has drawn a picture of herself (a pretty good approximation, I have to say) and each body part is linked to a story or thought. Within these body parts are links to further stories. </p>
<p>It's pretty clear now that Jackson is really, really super interested in bodies along with words. But I wouldn't say that this is a love letter to her body, there's something a little unsettling going on here that I can't explain at this point. Perhaps I should look more carefully; I've only spent a little time reading through.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>At the end of class today we were wondering whether there are any sites outside of Shelley Jackson's main Skin site in which people with tattooed words could talk or connect with each other.  Well, I found <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart"> this</a>. (And, to be honest, is wasn't that hard to find, so maybe others have seen it.  It was linked on Wikipedia.)  The livejournal page--A Mortal Work of Art--allows the tattooed people to set up a community, and it's cool to see how friendly and excited they are to "meet", even if only on the web.  For example, look at <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/mortalworkofart/146352.html">"Rocks"'s intro</a> and see the comments posted below of people saying hi.  (And check out the joke at the bottom: "On a somewhat twisted note, although it's against the rules to get a word tattooed on the body part it describes (when it's obvious it's a body part like knee or wrist) it would have been a hilarious placement choice to put "Rocks" on your testicles. LMAO. Painful... but amusing."  Sorry, I couldn't help but include that.)  I think it's amusing, by the way, how "Rocks" and many others comment on how slow a process it is to receive the text and notification from Jackson.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Apparently I am.  I looked at her <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/stain.html"> website</a> (which was linked as "IS" to her Skin project; check it out if you haven't yet) as well as some of her other projects.  I don't even know how to begin to describe this, so check out the <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/toy.html">"toy"</a> she created.  Another unusual, interesting project she has is <a href="http://ineradicablestain.com/dollgames/index.html">"The Doll Games."</a>  As it says on the bottom of the first screen, it has to do with "doll sex, doll mutilation, transgender dolls, prosthetic doll penises, doll death, doll dreams."  She and her sister "began" it in 1970's when they played with and mutilated dolls. As Jackson says, "The Doll Games emerged in Berkeley, California at a time when race, gender, politics, and sexuality were fiercely and publicly debated. Indeed, as the dolls were taking their first steps toward literary history, the artists' family was opening a feminist bookstore just down the street from People's Park. The Doll Games' privately staged confrontations between androgynes and 'dainty ladies,' their outlaw utopias and anarchic child societies, and their uncompromising moral vision, cannot be understood without reference to the larger public discourse within which they took place."  Cool concept, I think.  You can look through journals they wrote for the dolls or look at pictures of transformed, reconfigured dolls.  (As a sidenote, I immeditaley clicked on "voyeurism" photo album because, as I posted earlier, I was trying to understand what that word means.  I thought the pictures made sense, because they are crotch shots of the dolls, but then I realized that the other albums contain similar photos.  Oh well.)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>"As soon as we say 'I' we begin to lie."  I'm very curious about this approximate quote of Shelley Jackson's.  By extension we assume that, since Jackson is a writer and explores this quote in her writing, it can also be stated, "As soon as we write 'I' we begin to lie."</p>
<p>I'm curious about this not so much because I agree or disagree, but because I fail to see the importance.  I have never seen pure objective truth as a goal of writing.  Perhaps more so in a supposedly nonfiction autobiography (but even then not some inarguable mathematical kind of truth,) but never in a fiction, even one based on real characters.  The goal is to take little snippets of truth, character tics such as a boy who expresses himself through his toes, and meld them together into a character that reads as true, regardless of whether he or she is or not.  The truth that writing strives toward is the truth of empathy.  The establishment of an emotional connection between writer and reader.</p>

<p>Lance Armstrong ran the NYC marathon in just under three hours.  The man is not a marthoner--he's a cyclist, obviously--and he hadn't really trained for this race at all (his longest run was 16 miles--most people do between 20 and 22 miles to prepare).  But he pulled off an awesome time.  (Well, if I had run that I would have retired.)  Anyway in the NYTimes special "local only" section, one of his pacers, Joan Benoit (Samuelson) basically claims that he wouldn't have been able to finish without her help.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I have been impressed with how much impassioned discussion has come in reaction to Jackson's "Skin" project. My initial reaction was positive, but reading the fire that has come down on this piece from <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/363">thenewblack</a> and <a href="http://machines.pomona.edu.170L/node/361">tophat1</a> caused me to question the validity of my own response. Hopefully I am going to quality and break down some of what I am thinking, but there is a distinct chance that I will just step into the middle of this. </p>
<p>Honestly, I think that there is real art and interesting thought in what Shelley Jackson is doing here. Walker's piece on distributed narrative raised interesting ideas on what exactly a narrative is and how much unity must factor into the equation. In a modern or postmodern world, we have to respect that any writing is radically compositional by its very nature. We <em>must</em> accept the fact that we or any output we produce is more complex than we can consciously account for. Knowing that, the convention of reproducible narratives with a regular form and single location seems constructed. Our ideas aren't rational, so why should the products of those ideas pretend to be? An attempt to look finished or insulated can be almost pretentious in an era where we are beginning to now better.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I am almost unnerved by how furious the basic conceit of Skin makes me.  Apart from the cult-like nature of Jackson's recruitment methods (Hey kids! Get an inane tattoo, in book font mind you, and I'll tell you the real story!), the idea of a text that you basically need to join a club to read is the height of elitism.  I suppose if one accepts the whole indie mentality of obscurity as the highest good, then one might be inclined to be really excited about this.  Not that I really have any right to tell Shelley Jackson how to express herself, but it seems to me that the goal of art should be to spread one's work as far as possible, to reach as many people as possible.  I find it hilarious that Shelley Jackson has managed to practically pull this off, and is getting attention for an experiment without any accessible content to back it up.  Let's just hope that the scientologists don't catch wind of this one.  That said, the one thing that I do admire about Skin is the way that the "words" are free to express their own interpretations of their tattoos on Skin's website.  At least they get some input here.</p>
