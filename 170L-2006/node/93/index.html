</ul></span>
    <div class="content"><p>Anonymous asked me, "How [do] you feel about blogs: what do you feel is lacking? What would supply it?"  </p>
<p>Hmmm. That's a great question, and a very hard one to answer.  I started out by replying to the comment, but then I realized that my comment was starting to get really really long and that I was going off on all sorts of related and unrelated tangents, triggering much incoherent rambling.  It was starting to turn into an exposition on all my feelings, as an individual, towards blogging and technology in general.  So, I thought maybe this should stand as a separate entry, instead of merely a comment. </p>
<p>So here goes.  How do I feel about blogs?  It's like asking me how I feel about, say, food or tv.  Such a broad topic! On the one hand, I appreciate blogs because they've allowed quicker, faster, more informal access to free information.  This is a very obvious fact that I feel we haven't really talked about yet: the literally FREE nature of blogs.  I was talking to my friend yesterday, and she said she reads certain art blogs because they compile information that would otherwise only be available in super-expensive art books. She reads <a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/">Tyler Green's blog</a> on modern art because it's her online lens into the expensive, high-class artworld and because it's affordable--it's free!  No membership fees, no payments! This free, unrestrictive nature of most blogs appeals to me greatly, but it is also the deluge of information that stems from this nature that overwhelms me.  So much information, so much to filter through! I often literally go off on tangents when I am surfing blogs, and end up a million miles away from where I started--a good and bad thing. </p>
<p>As far as what a blog lacks, I can't pinpoint specific flaws, but there are certain issues that I have with blogs--not necessarily pointing to what they lack, but more along the lines of problems.  I feel like blogs can very easily replace physical human contact.  This is a weird phenomenon, almost a contradictory one, as blogs have been made for support and praised for their ability to create online communities.  Within personal blogging networks like livejournal and even facebook (i'm calling facebook a "blog" for argument's sake), the ease and accessibility of blogs makes it alright for even close friends to merely check up on each other's lives through online postings rather than through face-to-face human contact. I see this as a problem, with the blog being the central perpetrator in gradually eliminating human contact.  The same problem occurs with instant messaging.  We are fine with an occasional "what's up?" and "LOL" instead of substantial conversation.  We can go for weeks without seeing a person, but we may still know what's up in their lives by stalking their blogs or their AIM profiles.  The interconnected nature of the online world has replaced much human contact in our lives.</p>
<p>Now, that was my attitude toward personal blogging networks.  As far as other blogs that are not so personal, and more geared towards a mass readership, I have to say I do not have much experience to be a fair judge.  From what I have seen, however, the sheer ease of making a blog has also made it very easy for a "trash culture" to build up online, with certain blogs (in my opinion, celebrity gossip blogs) reminding me of online versions of the National Enquirer.  I see these as the online equivalent of checkout aisle fodder.  Then again, other people find this very interesting, and I do appreciate that there's a space online for them to pursue their interests. There is always a market for such news, always consumers to eat up the juicy gossip.  So, even if such sites make no sense to me, another reader will appreciate its existence.  </p>
<p>I feel I've been very broad and all over the place, but that seems to be the very point: the content of the blogging world is so great that one can't make broad generalizations. Just like with television, I can't make generalizations about what blogs as a whole lack because of the sheer quantity and quality of blogs.  I will, however, contradict myself and make generalized statements like "There's a lot of trash on TV, but there do exist some stand-out, quality programs" because I personally think that feature applies to television and is also true for most media, including blogs.  What would enhance the blogging world?  Again, I would have to point to specific blogs in order to give concrete answers.  But if you pressed me to answer the question in general, I would express the need for a technology that would resolve my specific current issues (the ones mentioned above) with the blog.  I would like a new technology that would allow for blogs to truly enhance support and community without detracting from human contact--maybe some sort of built-in audio/visual microphone/cam that would come standard with blogs?  Hmm...that would be potentially creepy, though.  Well, I would like a non-creepy version of this, if possible.  Another issue that I talked about was the sheer amount of "trash" or blogs that individuals find irrelevant.  I would like a technology that would better filter through these blogs, sorting out the ones irrelevant to our own interests.  A potential problem that would come out of this, though, would be that the filtering technology would have to know enough about our personal/private interests in order to produce successful filtering--something that would possibly cross many lines and invade our privacy.  </p>
<p>I feel like I have been rambling for much too long, and that I have not quite successfully answered the original questions but instead brought up a number of other issues.  Hmm...I guess this is what blogging and linking is supposed to be.  Trains of thought leading to other relevant and sometimes irrelevant trains of thought.  I hope I have not been too incoherent during the process.</p>
