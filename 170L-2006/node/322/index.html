    <div class="content"><p>A bit about me, because i just know you all care oh so much: I like silly. I'm one of the English Department work-study stooges, and whenever i'm in the English library shuffling stuff about i like to slide around on the rolling ladders. I can also devote oodles of time to mundane tasks with nary a second thought, a habit born of RPG grinding as a wee lad, or mayhaps time spent working at magazines / freelancing,  trolling blogs and newsfeeds and such for hours, looking for stories to pitch to editors and the like. I'm also incredibly lazy. Frightfully so: deciding between going to get food or sitting on my ass is a difficult decision that requires a thoroughly contested list of pros and cons. I'm also woefully inattentive / easily distracted. </p>
<p>As an example, i'll provide a summary of my Monday afternoon, all times are approximates, dialogue paraphrased:</p>
<p>2:45: Return to Lawry after class, ready to start chipping away at the work i need to get done for the rest of the week / looming deadlines.</p>
<p>2:45 and 28 seconds: Hrmm... maybe i'll clean this toxic waste dump i've established a base-camp in.</p>
<p>2:45 and 29 seconds: Ooo... is that my ginourmous box of video game paraphernalia? And i'm talking about a *serious* collection here: a Sega Dreamcast with two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMU">VMUs </a> and classic titles like Power Stone 2 and Crazy Taxi, a Sega Saturn with Bug!, the original Rayman, the original Resident Evil, NBA Live '97 (anyone else remember when the Bulls were the greatest thing ever?), a Super Nintendo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Scope">Super Scope </a> (uncontestable proof of my badassedness), a copy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SNES_800.jpg">Super Famicom</a> (Japan-only) version of Super Mario Kart that only works on the aforementioned system so i can't actually play it but... who cares? It's a friggin' relic... and that's just the stuff off of the top of my head. I mean, wow, i should definitely show this to the guys in the common room...</p>
<p>6:45: GrumpyMutt: "Alright guys, we've been playing videogames for four hours. Lets go get some food."</p>
<p>7:30: GrumpyMutt: "God i hate Frary. Well, guess i'd better get started on all of this work."<br />
Suitmate: "Dude, is it Monday again already? Lets go on a booze run, get drunk, and play Need for Speed for hours."<br />
GrumpyMutt: "... I hate you guys... Let's roll." </p>
<p>Stuff gets hazy after that point.</p>
<p>There's a point in there. I showed up to the Planet Jemma website sort of knowing what to expect. So i clicked around, watched the first three or four microseconds of one of the videos... closed the site. Online Caroline lasted at least a minute or two longer: Signed up, got the point, googled for the "solution," 24 days getting emails wtf? "Dumped" her or got dumped or whatever she's calling unsubscribing. Jemma was silly, but silly in the same way that causes me to loathe edutainment and the absolute crap kids are watching these days. It's supposed to be getting young women interested in Physics. Noble effort! I know, let's find prominent female physicists and... ask them what their favorite color is. We'll throw in some pre-recorded video that starts off with something along the lines of "being the only girl in my physics class would be so much more awesome if the boys were cuter, teehee!" Check out <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/">How Stuff Works. </a> It's not directed at kids per se, but it's "education" done right. If i were a young intelligent woman with an interest in the sciences and I showed up to the Planet Jemma website, i'd leave with serious questions... about Society's expectations of myself as a female, in regards to heterosexuality, basic intelligence levels, etc. Okay fine i'm a cynic, but... take SpongeBob SquarePants as an example. I've been present when that show has shown up on televisions numerous times and i start to wonder--avert your eyes if you're squeamish, i'm woefully politically incorrect--does Nickelodeon actually think that America's youth, in it's entirety, is fucking retarded? And i get to wondering about the state of popular culture... is the goal of Big Media to create a society of mindless, spineless consumer-whores? And there's my personal theory, which i've been working on for some time: Our television shows, our music, our movies, etc... the whole Big Media thing is a lie, and all the content of "popular culture" is actually generated by two to three chimps dosed on four to five drops of AMT, chain-smoking unfiltered Lucky Strikes and hacking away at manual typewriters till the next episode of "Lost" or the next Madonna album is cranked out. Apologies if you like Lost. No seriously, i feel sorry for you. I've watched an episode or three... the reason it's called "Lost" is because it doesn't make any fucking sense, and the reason people watch so religiously is because it always sort of seems like *anything* at all might possibly be extrapolated on in the next "exciting" episode. My $.02.</p>
<p>And i read Kind of Blue last. A breath of fresh air. Online Caroline did not impress me for a variety of reasons. I love complex, but i'm not impressed by javascript tricks and what essentially amounts to viral marketing in narrative form. I fill out some questions and get a formulaic response with a bit of "character" tucked in to make me feel like i'm participating. Cute. Trying to trick me over the course of 24 cryptic emails. Cute. Everyone should go watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/"> The Usual Suspects </a> if you haven't already. SPOILER: The viewer is hoodwinked, and there are no cheap tricks, no ridiculous time-commitment (and yes, i do consider getting that email and having to "check in" with an uninteresting javascript applet a time-commitment), just good old-fashioned story telling. Fine, Kind of Blue doesn't do anything "new." But it does something well. A thing that Jemma and Caroline fail at. The end result is that I find myself... paying attention. Wanting to know more, genuinely interested in the characters and the like. Voyeurism without treating me like an idiot.  Yes, i know it's fiction. Yes, i know these characters don't exist. And you're not telling me to pretend to care? I can just... explore this unorthodox narrative and enjoy it? No hoops to jump through? Kudos to you, Mr. Rettberg.</p>
<p>Also, random aside: Natwwal posted... a few days ago, about a "silly little video game" about killing zombies and sanity dropping and the like. It's called Eternal Darkness for the Gamecube, and i highly recommend everyone give it a try, or at least watching someone else giving it a try. Inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft... Sure, generic in the kill zombies sort of way. But also an excellent example of the sort of immersive-voyeurism that Rettberg pulls off so well. Yes, you're playing a video game. But the atmosphere, sort of like Kind of Blue, does a great job of sucking you in. The sanity thing: let it get high enough, and the walls start bleeding, soft cries of women and children, generic video game stuff. But then there's the sudden blue screen of death, the game suddenly dropping you back to the title menu, the save/load screen telling you "your memory card's full. Formatting card. Format complete. Error reading memory card, cannot save." Or my personal favorite, i open a door and a screen pops up, congratulating me for completing the game, and telling me to be sure to pick up the sequel. Think pulling an all-nighter to work on a thirty page paper and having windows suddenly tell you that it lost your file, sorry! And then jump back ten seconds later with a "gotcha!" after you've  driven your fist through a wall. Sure, the sanity thing got pretty gimmicky after a while, but while it was fresh it was an excellent little fringe benefit... the sort of interaction between narrative and audience that doesn't really happen much. Umm... yay video games.</p>
<p>That about does it for me. If you Lost-ites get all pissy, I'm a South Park junkie so i suppose my opinions can be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
