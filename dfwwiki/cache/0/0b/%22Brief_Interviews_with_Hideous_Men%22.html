It takes the form of interview transcripts between an anonymous interviewer and several different male interviewees. Each male possesses a repulsive characteristic that they elaborate upon. The title alludes to the fact that these men are made hideous by certain aspects of their behavior. Certain qualities appear hideous and this can show through in a variety of ways. Ultimately, the reader is forced to search through each interview and find the distinguishing factor or factors that make the character seem hideous.

<p>The structure is organized with two notable features. The first of which is that each interview is prefaced with the interview number and date in the following manner: B.I. #3 11-94. In addition the location is given for all interviews. Secondly, questions are never explicitly given. The structure of Wallace's 'interviews' begin with questions indicated solely by "Q." where the preceding sentence (indicated by single quotes) contains the interviewee's response. These pieces are called 'interviews', though not all consist of questions and responses, rather, some appear in the form of a conversation or dialogue between two people.

<p>A man is interviewed who has a poor sexual history. He reports an uncontrollable compulsion to yell, "Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom" every time he orgasms(18). He mentions in the interview that he is not a political person and has no idea why this happens every time. He also claims to have anonymously phoned a radio 'doctor' who tells him he has <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Coprolalia" title="Coprolalia">Coprolalia</a>. The interviewed man expresses significant embarrassment as a result of this compulsory habit. Every sexual encounter proves to be a failure. He recognizes the extent to which this habit freaks the women he sleeps with out and acknowledges that even his explanations fail to atone for the action's embarrassment. He also explains that many of his sexual partners become condescending after hearing him yell "Victory for the Forces of Democratic Freedom" upon climax, a tendency which only magnifies his embarrassment. His embarrassment escalates to anger when partners feign apathy, saying things like, "I think I could love you anyway"(18).

<p>A man is interviewed who defends his implicitly abusive behavior. The interview fails to explicitly state what the man does that is so bad, however the man's responses allude to ill,"coerc[ive] behavior" (18).  He explains that "there are a surprisingly small number who require any coercion at all" (19). The most implicitly violent portion of the interview might exist in the continuation of the man's defense, where he says, "I mean, it's not as if I'm torturing them or burning them." (19). Brief Interview #15 ends with the interviewee's explanation that his father's proclivity for rage is the source of psychological origin. The father's behavior is furiously violent, so bad in fact, that "he would have to resort to cuffing his own wrists behind his back whenever he lost his temper"(19). This explanation attempts to justify or rationalize the interviewee's questionable behavior.

<p>Brief Interview #11 is between a man and the ostensible lover whom he is leaving. The man's explanation for why he must leave follows a circular trajectory that is only emphasized by the one way response structure. The interview begins when the man first apologizes to his lover for his "moody" and "withdrawn" behavior. He explains that this behavior is a result of the lover's fear of being abandoned.  This fear appears clearly connected with the man's reference to prior instances of abused trust when he tells his lover, "I know the other times didn't exactly make you feel secure" (20). The lover's insecurities are explained by the man as not the confirmation of fears, but the reason he is leaving.  He uses the lover's fears - fears that he, himself generated - as a justification for wanting to leave. The man then closes the circle as he retreats to his apologetic approach, taking on responsibility in saying, "It's us, us is why I'm leaving, okay?" (22). His last response mirrors the manner in which he begins the interview, as seen in his more delicate use of words such as "might" and "possibly" paired with the ending lines: "Can you see I might be pretty torn up about it too? Can you? That you're not alone in this'".

<p>Brief Interview #3 unlike the others in the series, is identified as 'overheard'. It breaks from the traditional Q&amp;A structure of the series and consists of a dialogue between two men: "A" and "R".
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot_4">Plot</span></h4>
<p>The third Brief Interview centers around a conversation between R____ and A_____, two anonymous men. R is in the process of telling A a story involving his last encounter at an airport. R reports leaving the plane last, whereupon he finds a woman in the emptied airport crying on her knees. An important feature might be that in establishing the story, R finds it important to comment on the woman sexual attributes. After he approaches the girl, she tells him of a heartbreaking story in which she met a man and fell in love, only to find herself forever waiting for the man to arrive back after ending his relationship back at  home. R proceeds to point out to A all of the terribly sad aspects of this event, explaining how his "heart's going out and all" because of "how it's true most guys are shit" (27). A asks R about the subsequent events involving the girl, to which R answers, alluding to intercourse.

He expresses a fear of marrying an attractive woman, who after child birth, loses her shape and attractiveness with it. He admits to having married his wife, for one reason, because she managed to have a child without the negative physical effects of giving birth.

<p>Interview #31 discusses issues of sexual satisfaction, selfishness, and desire. The interviewee is witnessed discussing love making techniques and criticizing the way in which some men are so selfish that their sexual behavior is selfless to a fault. He explains two categories of men who, in his view, lack the knowledge of how to adequately fulfill a woman's sexual needs. The first category of men he labels as the "Joe Sixpack cracker-type"(28). These men are selfish, wanting only to fulfill their own needs and nothing more. The second category includes the sensitive males, sarcastically referred to as the "Great Lovers" (29). The distinction is made that these men are not actually great lovers, but think themselves great. The issue with the men of this category is that "they're selfish about being generous" (31). They care considerably more about succeeding in pleasing a woman that sex becomes another way to show off. Throughout the passage, the interviewee gives another individual instruction and advice about smoking marijuana. The interview ends as the explains that what women really want is to think "you'll never forget her" (33).

He reports that the real problem he faced had nothing to do with his significant other. He chooses to get help for himself, though what this help is and the explicit reasons for seeking it remain wholly unclear. After recieving aid, he has higher self-esteem and claims to have "halted the shame spiral" (34). After the interviewee states, "I like myself", the interview concludes with the traditional use of  'Q.' indicating a question has been asked, followed by the man's enigmatic response: "'Who?'" (34).

<p>Brief Interview #40 follows the character of Johnny One-Arm, who might "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"'s most physically 'hideous' man. The interview begins as Johnny One-Arm exposes his deformed arm. Johnny's arm resembles a small "little and wet-looking" flipper that has a darker color than the rest of him (82). While Johnny One-Arm's arm is hideously deformed, he has no reservation in referring to it as "the Asset" (82).  He explains the ends to which he exploits this deformity in order to get physical attention from women. He explains that he expresses shame over his deformed arm in an attempt to gain pity. He narrates the procedure he follows, including the way in which he hides his arm until females becomes tormented over their own sense of pity and ask apologetically to see it. After this, he explains the way he transforms pity to shame, and ends comforting the females that were initially comforting him. The interview ends when Johnny begins to crudely gloat over the amount of sex this 'asset' allows him.

<p>The interviewee describes the bathroom of an opulent hotel. He mentions a man, ostensibly the bathroom attendant, who works six days a week in this environment. The interviewee goes on to describe the daily happenings inside this bathroom, covering everything from bowel movements to the odors that result. On the whole, these descriptions are rather unpleasant. In between these details, the interviewee identifies the previously mentioned bathroom attendant as his own father. He goes on to highlight the passive and subservient nature of his father's profession. The bathroom attendant's son (the interviewee) particularly focuses on the unpleasant bathroom behavior of upper class men, which contrasts the obsessively clean nature of his father. The bathroom attendant manages to fulfill all of his roles as an employee and as a father, though the interviewee notes that he has not seen his father since 1978, and assumes him to be still dressed in all white, "averting his eyes to preserve their dignity" (90). The interviewee expresses the reserved, and generally lacking demeanor that his father brought home from work, a likely explanation for his detachment. He goes on to explain the ways in which his father's profession and behavior has influenced him. In the end, it is unclear whether he admires his father's humble work, or despises him for his passivity.

<p>Brief Interview #2 consists of a conversation between a man and the woman he is seeing. The man begins by apologizing to his lover, expressing the care he has for her, and his concern over hurting her. He tells his lover that his relationship record "indicates a guy who's bad news" (91). He chronicles his relationship habits, and explains to her that he has a tendency to come on very strong at the beginning of relationships, and eventually not following through.  The  man consistently uses delicate wording and tiptoes around questions posed by the lover. He frequently stresses his honesty and concern over hurting his lover while simultaneously explaining the level of terror and torment he faces in trying to be honest with her. The man explains that a "same basic pattern" of behavior ended his previous relationships and goes on to describe the various aspects of their relationship in which his lover has made sacrifices to be with him (96). He continues to apologize and thank his lover, as he goes on to explain the extent to which he desires not to hurt her. He stresses that he does not want to distance himself, cheat, or flat out leave her, but these are features of his behavior that can not be ignored. The conversational 'interview' ends as he expresses growing concern over his lover's reaction as he tells her that he must  'clean his slate' and reveal a secret. The last lines consist of him asking his lover to promise to remain calm after he tells her the secret, emphasizing that "it's not going to sound good at all" (100).

<p>A man is described who does not fit with the other recognizably 'hideous' men. He frequently employs the use of finger flexions and describes his delight over simple activities such as dancing. He mentions his dating behavior, explaining that he must sense a "palpable affinity" between himself and the woman he is dating (100). He likens this affinity to the Australian profession of <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Chicken_sexing" title="Chicken sexing">chicken sexing</a>. The man reports that a moment arises on the night of every third date, when he senses things are just right and whereafter he asks his date how she would feel about being tied up. He describes this sequence of events in relation to a courting ritual and goes on to describe the reactions that his question elicits. The man describes that his own mother suffered from an "uneven temperament" which has resulted in a psychological complex "having to do with power, and perhaps, trust" (107). He explains the way in which his mother has shaped his behavior, the various ways he goes about receiving the power and trust he wants, how he weeps after each ritual, and how sexual intercourse has little weight.

He asks her, "Right?", to which the only supplied answer hides in the form of a "Q.". It is implied that she responds 'yes' because of the man's preceding response of "So c'mere.'"(116).

<p>Brief Interview #46 begins with the reference to Victor Frankl's <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning" title="Man's Search for Meaning">Man's Search for Meaning</a>. The 'interviewed' man praises the book and indirectly thanks the Holocaust for allowing Frankl to write it. The majority of the interview consists of the man arguing against knee-jerk attitudes, specifically the knee-jerk attitude towards violence that labels it as solely negative. He uses his discussion of Victor Frankl's book in order to establish a platform for which he also discusses violence towards women. He argues that women are faced with condescension and are treated as fragile, and that this fragile treatment hinders women's sense of dignity and respect. The interview man supplies details of related violence towards women that conveys a possible sense of having a similar or equally impacting encounter with violence. He pays little attention to the scarring effects of violence and chooses to specifically focus on violently grotesque instances of sexual abuse. He defends the positive aspects of abuse and violation, arguing that it deepens one's knowledge of "the human condition and suffering and terror and degradation" (118). The man describes  sexually and physically abusive accounts with a discussion of how painful experiences can be broadening. He holds the believe that self-objectification can be a means of self-identifying. All the while, his familiarity with violence seems to hover over the interview as he poses questions such as, "What if I said it happened to me?" and "Does it have to be a woman?" (124). The interview ends enigmatically as the man asks a series of pointed questions regarding the interviewer (or questionably the reader). It ends as he deflects any correlation between his story's content and his own experience, ending  with the abrasive claim: "You don't know shit" (124).

<p>In Brief Interview #59, the interviewed man reports his first experiences masturbating as a teenager. A little less than halfway through the interview, he mentions that his retelling of the past is intended to explain his current position at the 'Harold R. And Phyllis N. Engman Institute For Continuing Care'. Regarding the man's experiences with masturbation, he claims to have been heavily influenced by the television program <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Bewitched" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Elizabeth_Montgomery" title="Elizabeth Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a>, and her ability to supernaturally freeze all motion in <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Bewitched" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a> appealed to the interviewee as a child, and proved to have an impact on the boy's masturbatory fantasies. He reportedly  fantasized over her supernatural ability. As a teenager, the man's sexual fantasies primarily centered around this supernatural ability to control others. He expresses that this desire to control extended itself to galactic reaches and subsequently proved infeasible. This paired with the fact that <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Elizabeth_Montgomery" title="Elizabeth Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a> appeared "oblivious" on <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Bewitched" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a> after the actor who played her husband was replaced, contributed to the man's pledge to become abstinent at the age of seventeen (222). The man claims to have resultantly been endowed with a greater knowledge of love.

<p>The hideous man interviewed in Brief Interview #72 enthusiasitcally and unabashedly expresses his love for women. The word "love" is used exactly ten times in the fifteen line interview. His love for women is indiscriminate; however, it tends to focus on loving women as objects. This lends itself to an interpretation that recognizes a seemingly condescending feature present in the man's words. This is witnessed in the way he loves "to hear them giggle, the different little sounds" and the way "they bat their eyes or pout or give you that little look" (225). He explicitly says he is helpless to women and alludes to the world being doomed without them.

<p>Through the simultaneous responses of  K and E,  the topic of women and their relation to current expectations is addressed. The interview consists of responses made back to back, while questions posed by the 'interviewer' appear only three times. It begins as K articulates, "What does today's woman want. That's the big one" (226). From what is presumed to be a response or the rephrasing of a question, follows a discussion of the responsibilities faced by women. As the two men continue discussing women, they touch upon ideas involving <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Postmodernism" title="Postmodernism">postmodernism</a>, <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=New_feminism" title="New feminism">new feminism</a> and <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Post_feminism" title="Post feminism">post feminism</a>. K and E frequently make claims about the expectations modern women face, arguing that women are "in an impossible situation in terms of what their perceived sexual responsibilities are" (230). Modern women, as discussed by K and E, fall victim to the responsibilities and dependencies imposed by society. K speaks of the female sense of "autonomy-slash-responsibility", and attempts to qualify his view from an evolutionary standpoint. The conversation frequently involves generalizations that describe the behavior of women as subordinately dependent on the male, anxious, and conflicted.

<p>An interviewed man reports on his encounter with a female of the "Granola Cruncher", or post-Hippie, variety and how he came to 'fall in love' with her after hearing her horrific escape from near death. The man describes having met the Granola Cruncher at a concert (288). She is described as sexually attractive on the whole, despite having a 'strange face'. At the concert, he reports having approached her with a solely "one-night objective", though after hearing her anecdote, he describes being deeply moved to the extent that he falls in love with the Granola Cruncher (289). While being attacked, the Granola Cruncher is able to focus herself intently on the situation, and in doing so denies the knife-wielding psychotic rapist the feeling of forced control associated with the act of rape. Through the use of 'focus' and 'connection' , she is able to rob the psychotic of "the only way he'd ever found to connect" (312). The interviewed man recounts that in the Granola Cruncher's anecdote, her connection and intent inflicts far more pain on the psychotic than he could have ever inflicted upon her, making him weep as he penetrates her. The Granola Cruncher's focus somehow stops the psychotic man from injuring her, and drives away, leaving her weeping with gratitude in the gravel of the secluded location where the action of the anecdote takes place. The Granola Cruncher's tale inspires the interviewed man, opening his eyes to the fact that he has lived a life without actually loving anyone. The woman's story resultantly makes the man weep post coital, explaining at the end of the interview how he "had fallen in love with her", and how he felt she could save him. The interview concludes as the man stands naked in front of his anonymous 'interviewer', who is presumably a woman, vaguely explaining why he could not permit the Granola Cruncher to leave him. The ending suspends knowledge, and fails to explain what results of  the Granola Cruncher. In the last lines, the interviewee addresses the interviewer with a string of obscenities, ending with the following series of staccato sentences: "Happy now? All borne out? Be happy. I don't care. I knew she could. I knew I loved. End of story." (318).

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interpretation">Interpretation</span></h2>
<p>These interviews offer two general levels of interpretation.  On the more surface level, the interviewers give insight to basic human need and instinct.  They can be realistic portraits of the "hideousness" of humanity.  On a deeper level, the interviews make a critical commentary on the vicious loop of self-consciousness.  The characters are often trapped in never-ending cycles of self-awareness that bring sincerity into question.  For example, many of the speakers say things like, "I'm aware of how it might sound"(287) and become insincere in their motives: are they being sincere for the sake of manipulation, or for the sake of sincerity?.]
</p><p>The difficult task, then, is to examine with what level of trust the reader is to interpret the sincerity of the interviewees, and, conversely, to what degree the interviews should be regarded as commentary on self-consciousness and metafiction rather than reverence to human emotion.  One must decide whether to take the interviews for their valuable insight into hideousness and relationships, or to go to a deeper level of Wallace’s own commentary on his writing.  In making this decision, the context of the work must be considered within the novel as well as the degree that Wallace’s own hand becomes visible in the text of the various interviews.
</p><p>The task becomes frustrating in a way that Wallace may have intended.  The line between trust and cynicism is one that Wallace often challenges his readers to walk and investigate.  We can conclude that at times there is a line where we must cease our self-consciousness; if we are endlessly self-aware, then we will never stop questioning our motives and the motives of others.  
</p><p>The human question: What makes one person truly hideous?
How can we escape the loop of self-consciousness without being oblivious or unaware?
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Criticism">Criticism</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tom_LeClair">Tom LeClair</span></h3>
<p>LeClair places the speakers’ sincerity into question, suspicious that Wallace is simply using first person speakers other than himself in order to pour in melodrama and softness without seeming sentimental himself.  He argues that readers come to realize the artificiality of the transcripts when placing them in the context of the other, “cooked”(LeClair 32) pieces.  In attempts to repel the reader, Wallace, in LeClair’s interpretation, moves too far from trustworthy emotion in the interviewees for the reader to view the transcripts as commentary on the human condition.  Instead, LeClair finds that Wallace’s work in many of the stories in Brief Interviews With Hideous Men echoes the “thought experiments” of Barth, Borges, and others.  Ironically, Wallace himself often criticizes these writers for their narcissistic, “look at me” styles of self-conscious, postmodern irony.  LeClair even compares the possible “intricate design” of the title story to Barth’s Lost in the Funhouse, a work Wallace criticizes and attempts to turn the tables on in his work “Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way.” 
LeClair’s conclusions on the entire selection are largely controlled by these comparisons, because he considers the “Brief Interviews” segment to be raw while the other pieces of fiction are cooked.  He sees this combination to be dangerous because the reader begins to meld the narrators of both together as the “pathological first person voice oozes into”(LeClair 33) the third person narrations in other stories.  The sincerity of the narratives in the title story becomes doubtful and less than trustworthy.  If the same voice that creates “highly cooked fictions” containing thought experiments is noticeable in a piece that attempts to be raw, the reader begins to suspect that the interviewees are part of a thought experiment as well.  The hideous men’s narratives are no longer valued for their insights into human nature.  Instead they are seen as subtler, sneaky efforts by Wallace to test out his own logic and games.
</p><p>This raises the question of how to read the piece of fiction within the volume.  LeClair’s observation that the whole book is “Yet Another Example of the Porousness of Certain Borders” means that no pieces stand alone.  The pieces are considered together Wallace’s attempt to “complete a larger pattern”(LeClair 33) LeClair’s judgments of many other pieces in the volume are somewhat unsupported, making it unfair to necessarily judge the interpretation of “Brief Interviews with Hideous Men” from LeClair’s ideas about other stories.
LeClair concedes that the characters in the interviews exhibit the narcissism of humanity with a focus on the “inward bound”(LeClair 32) feelings the men have in regards to sex and relationships.  He fails to elaborate on these themes, finding that the last speaker’s extreme sentimentality forces the reader to question his sincerity. 
</p><p>In the 20th interview, the speaker tells of how he seduced the “Granola Cruncher,” then didn’t fall in love with her until she “related the story of the unbelievable horrifying accident” in which she was raped and almost killed.  LeClair asserts that the voice starts to sound more and more like Wallace as the speaker discusses philosophical ideas that Wallace has previously mentioned (“the narcissism, materialism, and complacency” of modern culture (Wallace, Interviews, 290)).  LeClair offers the likelihood that this is truly Wallace speaking, as he self-consciously examines a wariness toward sincerity and relates narrative to the story the “Granola Cruncher” related to him (Wallace, Interviews, 298).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Marshall_Boswell">Marshall Boswell</span></h3>
<p>In <i>Understanding David Foster Wallace</i>, Boswell argues that the point of the Brief Interviews is to test our capacity for empathy. This test comes in the final interview (B.I. #20).  The structure of the Brief Interviews--the textless 'Q'-- "puts the reader ‘inside the story as a character, making her a participant in the narrative’s construction’ (188).  As a result of this, the reader's views are inexorably bound to the interviewer's.  As the interviews with these hideous men progress, the interviewer becomes increasingly cynical, as does the reader. The men exhibit the sort of sham-honesty and false sincerity that make it virtually impossible to trust anyone  Yet the final interview is sincere.  The test is whether the reader can believe this.  The interviewer clearly does not, as can be inferred from how the interviewed man lashes out at her in the end: "I stand here naked before you.  Judge me, you chilly cunt." Boswell concludes that for B.I. #20, "the actual reader is right there inside the piece, as both the ‘object’ and ‘subject’ as the person addressed directly and whose empathy becomes the work’s silent and therefore living dynamic force” (198).
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Film">Film</span></h2>
<p>John Krasinksi, famous for playing Jim Halpert on NBC's The Office, adapted Wallace's story for the screen and directed the film.  After lobbying Bonnie Nadell, Wallace's agent, for the rights to the story and getting rejected several times, Nadell finally gave in.  Wallace called Krasinski to give his blessing to the project.  The film is the only one of Wallace's works to be successfully adapted to film.
For the screenplay, Krasinski created a main character that does not appear in the book, a female graduate student who serves as the interviewer.
The IMDB.com synopsis:
</p>
<blockquote>After her boyfriend mysteriously leaves her with little explanation, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at a prestigious East Coast university Sara Quinn is left looking for answers as to what went wrong. Directing all her energies into her anthropological dissertation, Sara conducts a series of interviews with men in an effort to uncover the secret thoughts that drive their behavior. She thinks she can remedy both her heartache and her academic challenges with a new research project and begins conducting a series of interviews with men. As she records the astonishing and disquieting experiences of various subjects, Sara discovers much more about men and herself than she bargained for.</blockquote>
<p>Krasinski's thoughts about the film:
</p>
<blockquote>I have wanted to adapt this book into a film ever since I first heard it out loud.  In college, I was asked to be a part of a staged reading of the interviews.  I can honestly say that, until that moment, I hadn’t really even thought about being an actor outside of school.  It was in that one night’s performance where my personal definition of acting went from just “an opportunity to make my friends laugh” to this incredible sense of “being a part of something.”  As cliché as that sounds, I had never been so moved in watching a theater performance, seeing how all the interviews worked as a group.  David Foster Wallace, in my opinion, is one of the greatest writers we’ve ever had, certainly in the last twenty years.  His obvious dominance of the English language is partnered with honest moments and the most beautifully dark sensibility.  The result is an astounding book, and the most awesome material for an actor!</blockquote>
