Feel free to add anything I miss or get rid of anything you consider dumb. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 21:59, 21 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Changes: modified some tags, began adding characters. I think some characters, such as Hal and Gately at the bare minimum, deserve their own pages, in addition to short summaries in the IJ article. Some of those articles are linked in. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ryan" title="User:Ryan">Ryan</a>
</p><p>Started making the Hal and Gately pages and Joelle Van Dyne's page.  Bolstered the criticism section with several new articles.   Also added some stuff about abusable escape and "artificial happiness."  would like to add stuff about "breaking out of the cage." lrose wrote a good piece on it, if you happen to read this, could I post some of it? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 21:19, 28 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Created Recommended Reading template, began filling it in.  also, should there be a section for links/crossover themes with other works?  is that worthwhile? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 21:52, 28 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey MR. Yeah, I'll definitely add cage/addiction stuff. I kind of wrote my second paper on that general topic so I'll try and fuse all of it. I'm working on A Supposedly Fun Thing right now, but as soon as I'm done with that, I'll start working on this. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 21:56, 28 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I was bored so I just added a few possible random motifs. Feel free to erase or change... <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 23:18, 28 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Good stuff.  Added erdedy, some details on ETA, and lenz.  do they need their own pages? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 12:13, 29 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey guys, I wrote my last paper about Orin, so I added a page for him. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 16:46, 29 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Thanks for adding that stuff; I bolstered it with some specifics on Orin's sexual problems and comparisons to hideousness. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 13:09, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I'm going to change the plot part to make it simpler.  I'll put in the years (or maybe also important dates), and we can just fill in the parts that we think matter.  That way we don't have to go through each story separately, and it may even help us get a better grip on what was happening when.  I'll admit it, I've spent forever reading this book and there's still a ton of stuff that I'm totally lost on when it happened or where or whatever.  Also, if a certain year doesn't have any highlights, we can just take it out completely.  <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 16:18, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Just like we're making separate pages for each motif, I think we should do the same with the themes. It'll clean up the page and I'm guessing the theme pages will be so long that it'll be better to have them on separate pages. What does everyone think? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 16:57, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>That'll work definitely.  We could even include a link to the main themes page that has been suggested in class.  Also, page 910 has quick examples for teeth and annularity as motifs, though they're just mentioned in passing.  <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 16:40, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Ok, so I just tried making each IJ theme its own page, but, the problem is that in trying to make say "Addiction" its own page, it immediately got linked to the addiction page from the "Themes Page" page. Does that make any sense? So, that means we can't have the IJ theme of addiction be its own page because it would lead back to the overall addiction page. What should we do? We can name is something different, like "Addiction (IJ)" or something of the like. Or we could just have all of the theme analysis on the main page. I'm just worried about that because I know all the themes will have a TON of information and it will make the main IJ page really really long. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 17:04, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey guys, I have a question about the chronology of the years that's listed here. Our wiki currently says that Y.D.A.U. corresponds to 2011, which is what a number of sources say. There is, however, other evidence that Y.D.A.U. is 2009-- this is what Kathleen told us in class, and there is textual evidence for it as well (both arguments can be found on Wikipedia if you're curious). Should we put in both possibilities to be thorough? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 12:54, 1 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I tried to add some stuff about happiness to what was already there but I'm finding it difficult to coherently fuse two discrete pieces of writing, so if anyone wants to continue changing it or editing it, please feel free. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 16:15, 2 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>KK: yes, we should definitely acknowledge the confusion; it's totally conceivable that dfw either did it on purpose to play with our perception of time or just made a mistake, because it's a very long book!--<a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Emrad" title="User:Emrad">emrad</a> 16:17, 2 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I'd like to make a section on the various support groups that make their appearance in IJ (I was planning to include AA, UHID, and Al Anon as understood through Phob-Comp-Anon) and their different philosophies but there's no obvious place to put it. Once the plot summary's up I'd imagine I'll be able to link the support groups individually there, but should there be another section for major non-character but also non-abstract parts of the IJ world? off the top of my head, things like support groups, tennis, the Entertainment, The E.T.A. (although this is linked from the characters section), the Ennet House (likewise) and the Incredibly potent DMZ. -will
</p><p>I just added stuff about irony, addiction, and cliche, but they are definitely not comprehensive and also some is from a paper I wrote; so if it doesn't make sense or if it needs more, please feel free to add, edit, mutilate, or erase. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 11:50, 3 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>bolstered the cliché section with a bit about the bricklayer urban legend.  any ideas on how to possibly trim this thing?  we're starting to get warning messages from the software.  apparently some browsers have trouble loading a page over 32kb, and we're at 44kb already and nowhere near done.  <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 17:14, 4 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>The best way to trim it would be to make each theme a separate page...it will just take some rerouting because if you click on say, cliche now, it will take you back to the cliche entry from the themes page, whereas we will want a new page to pop up that is a cliche in IJ page. does that make any sense? if that's what we want i can do it... <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 17:34, 4 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>That would definitely work, I can help do that as well.  I bet it would make the page more readable too.  Also, I decided that breaking down the plot threads by year is completely dumb.  most of the stuff happens in YDAU, so it'd be nicer to break it down by group of characters or something else.  Probable categories: Gately, Hal and ETA, Marathe and the AFR, the Incandenza family drama (better title hopefully). any better ideas? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 13:09, 5 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Moving this sentence from the "Freedom/Choosing" section in case anyone wants it to help them edit the section: Just to start, here are a collected list of page numbers to look at if anyone desires: 318, 412, 416, 423-4, 780. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Meg" title="User:Meg">Meg</a> 16:48, 5 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Someone modified some tags so the plot/setting segments were all in a category labeled "Ennet House". Corrected this. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ryan" title="User:Ryan">Ryan</a> 18:33, 5 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Ok, so in an effort to trim this page, I've made each theme a new page. If this looks good to everyone, great. If not, feel free to change it back or ask me too. The only thing we loose by doing this is that for the rest of the site, when you click on, say <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Irony" title="Irony">irony</a>, it will go to the irony page from the themes page, whereas now if you click on irony on the IJ page, it will go to the <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Irony_in_Infinite_Jest" title="Irony in Infinite Jest">Irony in Infinite Jest</a> page. It's hard to explain so I hope that make sense. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Lrose" title="User:Lrose">lrose</a> 19:21, 5 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>awesome work. that must've taken forever.  looks great though.  i'll add links to the major theme pages from the "theme in Infinite Jest" pages. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 20:35, 5 May 2009 (PDT)
