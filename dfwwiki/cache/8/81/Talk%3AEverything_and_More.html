</p><p>Nice! Question:  what does the (1) at the end of the summary mean? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 06:15, 24 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Oh, I get what the (1) is! It's an MLA parenthetical citation, is it? I moved it to right after the "pop technical writing" quote to make the citation clearer. Also, since IYI appears throughout the text, I didn't think it was as necessary to reference these quotes. Let me know if you disagree. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 06:21, 24 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>rrr, how do I make the brief intro to criticism a sub-heading/section of Criticism? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 07:09, 24 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>This sort of thing should be on the discussion page "Insert / mention / analyze criticism on Everything and More." <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Rudy" title="User:Rudy">Rudy</a> 11:28, 24 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Tammy, I like your part about the criticisms of the work, but I had a question. You mention our class discussions, and I was wondering if we all think that's formal/scholarly enough for the wiki? I have mixed feelings about it. I wonder if there's an actual review that we could find that would say what you're saying? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 16:11, 24 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Good question. I don't think class discussion material is necessarily formal enough for a wikipedia entry, but since this is our class wiki, I think it's up to us. My reason for putting it in is 1) I thought it was a well-expressed and wonderful idea and 2) Wallace gives a part of himself to his readers by inserting himself in his supposedly non-fictional articles. Can we also give a part of ourselves, our class, to future readers of the wiki by imparting pieces of our class discussions? I'll also post this on the main page, to see what others think. Meanwhile, it would be nice if we found reviews that corroborate this opinion. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 21:47, 24 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>That's a good idea, I'm just not sure one way or the other about it. Meanwhile, I did some work and also bolded the individual themes under the "Themes" section so as to better visually distinguish between them. If you guys know of any other examples mentioning the "beauty" or "sexiness" of math in the text, feel free to add them in, since I only went through the first few pages.How many examples should we be using for things like the themes? I just have no idea. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 15:46, 25 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I also just added a more general "critiques" heading under the criticism section, so that we could put things that weren't errors there. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 16:05, 25 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey KK,
I like the critique you put up--very nice! Also, I'm working on some sexiness and math stuff. I'll post it when I solidify it a little more. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 18:09, 25 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Nice! I like the "infinity" section under themes. I added "abbreviations" to the same theme as "footnotes," because when I wrote the  IYI part I felt like the two were pretty well connected. Or I guess we could do a separate one too. Thoughts? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 16:12, 26 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey, I just added the sexy math section under themes. I came up with this theory...but I ended it with a question mark. Was my conclusion at all logical? Please let me know what you think. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 12:03, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey Tammy, I read through the sexy math section, and I think it definitely makes sense. Take out that question mark at the end! I like it! <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 15:34, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Ok, will do... thanks KK! <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 06:13, 1 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Just created a further reading section, and added a review DFW wrote for science mag.  please edit it if you feel it should be or even delete it if you find it irrelevant.  i just thought this section would help to expose Wallace's mathematical inclinations outside of just infinity.  <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:MR" title="User:MR">MR</a> 17:37, 30 April 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hi MR, the further reading section (and article) is terrific--and this page is an apropos one to put it on, I think. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 06:13, 1 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I agree, MR's section is a great addition to the page. So what else do you guys think we need here? I'm kind of struggling with what else to add . . . <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 12:46, 1 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I bolded the themes to make them look better. I still need to edit/break down the map of math entry. It looks kind of ugly on the page right now. Uhhh, KK, do you have the criticism we used for our presentation? Maybe we can add that as a link? Also, do we want to add some of our class presentation questions under Questions? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 19:36, 1 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>About the "sexy" math...I think the whole idea as a metaphor for the propagation of the human species is a stretch.  I just saw it as typical tongue-in-cheek Wallace-ian humor that characterizes so much of his writing.  In this specific case, sexy is used as a humorous synonym for 'exciting' or 'enticing.'  'Sexy' is used in the same way in one of the footnotes in old English 67 syllabus, which you can find online: "Here's a somewhat sexier riff on 'interpretation' from Prof ____'s syllabus for one of his past E67s."  Here it is that literary interpretation = sexy.  Humor and unique voice? Yes. Propagation of the species? Not likely. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ag1646" title="User:Ag1646">Ag1646</a> 22:30, 1 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Ok. Point well-taken. It may be a stretch, but I do provide evidence for my reasoning, so I wouldn't say it's unfounded, and plus, it's just a theory--like literary interpretation in general, right? I'd be happy to acknowledge at the beginning of the A Word on Sexy Math blurb that sexy may very well be just a part of the author's humor and voice...and mean no more than that, but I don't think we should introduce extra-textual or intentional fallacy-prone evidence just to dismiss all meaning from the linkage between sexy and math. Thoughts? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 08:58, 2 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Just because literary interpretation allows room for different theories doesn't mean we can post any of them, especially if they are stretches - as I think this one is.  Your argument isn't entirely unfounded, but then again there are certain things that you haven't supported.  If, indeed, "math becomes a metaphor for sex, and infinity a metaphor for the human race" then why isn't the human race at all mentioned in the book?  You're saying that this metaphor is at the heart of the book, yet there is nothing intertextual to support this inference. Wallace never focuses on something so broad as the human species and its propagation in this book.  Besides, why would this metaphor even be relevant to infinity in the first place?  If you can give me some solid answers to these question I'd be more persuaded by the sexy math--&gt;propagation of the species metaphor.<a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ag1646" title="User:Ag1646">Ag1646</a> 16:36, 2 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hi Ag, I revised the piece and emphasized that the propagation of species metaphor is just one theory. After rereading, I do still believe there is evidence for this metaphor, and it's one I find delightful and far more satisfying to me as a reader than the dismissal of the term as just an example of Wallace-ian humor. But I have included the humor idea as well. If you'd like to expand on that, feel free. Although, one thing I did not include was the syllabus detail; seemed like a we'd be using the intentional fallacy (which I do not have a problem with, as long as we let the reader be aware that we are committing the intentional fallacy to support this claim).<a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 07:51, 6 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey Tammy I just moved some of the stuff around for the sexy math section.  Nothing has been taken out, but I think the structure is more clear now.  Tell me if you think it's OK? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ag1646" title="User:Ag1646">Ag1646</a> 20:34, 6 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Hey Ag, I rearranged a little more, to avoid redundancies. I thought it would be a good idea to introduce the paragraph explaining that the word sexy infiltrates the text (infiltrates may not be the best word here, but it's the only one I can come up with now). Feel free to let me know if you'd like to further edit. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 21:23, 6 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>One of the reasons that I rearranged it the way I did is because I don't agree with the statement that "sexual imagery mingles with math."  There is the word sexy.  There is no sexual imagery.  <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ag1646" title="User:Ag1646">Ag1646</a> 21:27, 6 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Ah. But there is--the marriage/union, and innocent of college math quotes? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 21:28, 6 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I'd say that the marriage/union has more to do with a way to describe how perfectly the two concepts went together.  Sex isn't even explicitly mentioned.  Innocent of math I also think has more to do with Wallace's humor...it's a play on the exaggeration that college classes can "corrupt" your mind.  Read otherwise, it's saying that math classes have had sex with the students.  Which doesn't seem right for several reasons.  Also, even if these images qualify as sexual, are 2 examples enough to claim that sexual imagery mingles with math throughout the entire novel?  I don't have a problem with you keeping the quote, but I don't think it should be together with the paragraph you wrote on voice.  The idea that it's memorable minutia is sufficient and far more accurate, I think. 
</p><p>I don't know if Tammy and I are going to agree on this, so let's make it a group decision.  Kirsten, Rudy - input? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Ag1646" title="User:Ag1646">Ag1646</a> 23:55, 6 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>I'm somewhat inclined to agree with Ag here-- there isn't any sexual imagery throughout the piece, only the term "sexy." But I'm not really sure how to go about fixing the paragraph, and I do think that maybe that part could be moved or transformed. <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:KK" title="User:KK">KK</a> 12:12, 7 May 2009 (PDT)
</p><p>Ok. Let's change it back to the way Ag last left it. Is there a way to do that by the click of a button? <a href="/dfwwiki/index.php?title=User:Tammy" title="User:Tammy">Tammy</a> 14:04, 8 May 2009 (PDT)
