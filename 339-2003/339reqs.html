  <p><span class="subhead4">Course Requirements and Grading</span></p>
  <p>The direction of this seminar and what you get out of it will largely be 
    determined by your preparation and commitment. The particular assignments 
    will include the following:</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Class Facilitation:</span> Each of you will be asked to 
    lead the class at one meeting; you will begin the class with a brief, polished 
    presentation of about 15 minutes, and then guide our discussion of that week's 
    reading. Your presentation and facilitation can take any direction or format 
    that interests you; feel free to discuss your plan with me before your chosen 
    date. (20%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Annotated Bibliography:</span> Together, we will compile 
    over the course of the semester a large annotated bibliography listing and 
    describing research resources in the field. I'll give you during the 
    first week a copy of the bibliography produced by the class last time out; 
    this will serve as a useful starting point. Your contribution to our bibliography 
    may be made at any point during the semester, and should consist of a minimum 
    of ten (10) entries. These entries may be article- or book-length resources. 
    Please use MLA citation format for the entry itself, and please annotate each 
    entry with a concise paragraph describing the text's argument and its 
    potential usefulness. As this is a communal project, we want to avoid duplication, 
    so those who contribute early may have an advantage. The bibliography-in-progress 
    will be housed in the Pomona English department library, and will include 
    a sign-up sheet on which you can announce your intent to write on particular 
    texts. Please use this assignment as a means to begin the research for your 
    term paper. All entries must be complete and turned in by April 15. At the 
    end of the semester, I will compile the bibliography and distribute copies 
    to each of you, for future reference. (20%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Term Paper:</span> The bulk of your written work over 
    the course of the semester will be aimed at producing a 15-20 page publishable-quality 
    article on the televisual topic of your choice. This article should make a 
    focused, engaging argument about the subject it takes on. You may use any 
    methodology that appeals to you &#8212; such as textual analysis, audience 
    ethnography, archival research &#8212; or any combination of methodologies, 
    provided your argument warrants that approach. Early in the semester, I will 
    ask you to turn in a detailed proposal (250-500 words) outlining your proposed 
    argument and area of interest. You will not be tied to this proposal; you 
    will, in fact, be encouraged to revise and resubmit it as your ideas change. 
    Shortly before the paper is due, you will exchange papers with a partner for 
    a peer review; also, the last two classes of the semester will be given over 
    to paper presentations, about which more later. Feel free to come discuss 
    your work with me at any stage. (50%)</p>
  <p><span class="sage">Attendance and Participation:</span> The standard. Show 
    up, and show up prepared. (10%)</p>
