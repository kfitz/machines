<blockquote> 
  <p>Television is, in many respects, among the most important and yet conflicted 
    forms of American popular culture available for study today. It is at one 
    and the same time an expression of popular values and a manipulation of those 
    values; it is an overwhelmingly &quot;top-down&quot; cultural formation that 
    is nonetheless used by its viewers in creative and interesting ways. For these 
    and many other reasons, television is the object of both academic fascination 
    and academic anxiety, and thus serves as a useful case study for those interested 
    in critical approaches to popular culture. In this course, we'll study television 
    from a number of perspectives, exploring both the form itself -- its technological 
    structures, its historical development, and its cultural work -- and the academic 
    writing produced around the form, writing both of celebration and condemnation. 
    Throughout this study, we'll also maintain an interest in how this critical 
    work surrounding television can inform the study of other aspects of popular 
    culture.<br>
