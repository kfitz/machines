  Requirements</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This direction of this 
  seminar and what you get out of it will largely be determined by your preparation 
  and commitment. The particular assignments will include the following: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Class Facilitation:</b> 
  Each of you will be asked to lead the class at one meeting; you will begin the 
  class with a brief, polished presentation of about 15 minutes, and then guide 
  our discussion of that week's reading. Your presentation and facilitation can 
  take any direction or format that interests you; feel free to discuss your plan 
  with me before your chosen date. <b>(20%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Annotated Bibliography:</b> 
  Together, we will compile over the course of the semester a large annotated 
  bibliography listing and describing research resources in the field. Your contribution 
  to this bibliography may be made at any point during the semester, and should 
  consist of a minimum of ten (10) entries. These entries may be article- or book-length 
  resources. Please use MLA citation format for the entry itself, and please annotate 
  each entry with a concise paragraph describing the text's argument and its potential 
  usefulness. As this is a communal project, we want to avoid duplication, so 
  those who contribute early may have an advantage. The bibliography-in-progress 
  will be housed in the Pomona English department library, and will include a 
  sign-up sheet on which you can announce your intent to write on particular texts. 
  Please use this assignment as a means to begin the research for your term paper. 
  All entries must be complete and turned in before Thanksgiving. At the end of 
  the semester, I will compile the bibliography and distribute copies to each 
  of you, for future reference. <b>(20%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Term Paper:</b> The 
  bulk of your written work over the course of the semester will be aimed at producing 
  a 15-20 page publishable-quality article on the televisual topic of your choice. 
  This article should make a focused, engaging argument about the subject it takes 
  on. You may use any methodology that appeals to you -- such as textual analysis, 
  audience ethnography, archival research -- or any combination of methodologies, 
  provided your argument warrants that approach. Early in the semester, I will 
  ask you to turn in a detailed proposal (250-500 words) outlining your proposed 
  argument and area of interest. You will not be tied to this proposal; you will, 
  in fact, be encouraged to revise and resubmit it as your ideas change. Shortly 
  before the paper is due, you will exchange papers with a partner for a peer 
  review. Feel free to come discuss your work with me at any stage. <b>(50%)</b>
