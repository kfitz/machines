  Description</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Television is, in numerous 
  respects, among the most important and yet conflicted forms of American popular 
  culture available for study today. It is, at one and the same time, an expression 
  of popular values and a manipulation of those values; it is an overwhelmingly 
  "top-down" cultural formation that is nonetheless used by its viewers in creative 
  and interesting ways. For these and many other reasons, television is the object 
  of both academic fascination and anxiety. In this course, we'll study television 
  from a number of perspectives, exploring both the form itself -- its technological 
  structures, its historical development, and its cultural work -- and the academic 
  writing produced around the form, writing both celebratory and anxious. </font>
