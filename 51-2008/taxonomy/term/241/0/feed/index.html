 <description>&lt;p&gt;Avital makes some very interesting points in her essay, all of which are very hard to draw into one solid point. One of these ideas which I found very intriguing was her parallel between characteristics lent to the female body such as death, life, despair and how she saw a connection between the Gulf War. This connection was mainly apparent to the conditions of the war. Maybe she considered it to be female like because it was a very unfair war..where Iraq was taken advantage of or maybe she was alluding it to the general public there who suffered: desparate children and mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
