 <title>Point of View</title>
 <link>http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/51-2008/node/197</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I think its interesting to consider if the point of view is important vs. the technology. What i mean by this is that in the readings there is debate over say the camera and taking photographs. Taking photographs some argue takes away from painting and that it is really the camera that does all the work. The same can be said of film- it is reall the camera that we connect with and not the actor some argue. What i think is difficult about all of this is that without humans the technology would have never been invented. I feel that this aspect of the debate is hardly spoke about.&lt;/p&gt;
