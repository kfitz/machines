  Requirements and Grading</font> </h3>
<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Attendance and Participation:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  As our work here will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness 
  are indispensable, and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; 
  each additional unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. <b>(15%)</b> 
  </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Class Facilitation:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  Each student will be responsible for facilitating one class session, helping 
  direct our discussion on the novel you select or are assigned. This presentation 
  will require you to produce and distribute a brief annotated bibliography on 
  your subject, and to lead a Web Crossings discussion in the days prior to your 
  in-class presentation. The presentation itself should be no more than fifteen 
  minutes long, and should be formally prepared and delivered. More details about 
  this assignment will be forthcoming. <b>(15%)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Reading Responses:</b> 
  Each student will be responsible for participating in each week&#146;s Web Crossings 
  discussion, contributing questions and ideas that require further attention 
  during class. While you will only be required to post once each week, posting 
  more often is better. Again, more details to follow. <b>(15% total)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Papers:</b> Early in 
  the semester, you will produce one 5-to-7 page paper that carefully addresses 
  one critical issue in the relationship of postmodernism to the text of your 
  choosing. This paper may later serve as the jumping-off point for your term 
  paper, or you may abandon this topic altogether and work on something new. The 
  term paper, due at the end of the semester, will be 20 pages long, will involve 
  substantial research, and will make a complex, well-defined argument. You will 
  submit a proposal for this paper several weeks in advance of the paper itself; 
  shortly before the paper itself is due, you will submit a draft to a peer reviewer. 
  All papers must use proper MLA format. <i>Late papers will only be accepted 
  by prior arrangement.</i> Again, more details to follow. <b>(brief paper, 15%; 
  term paper, 40%)</b> </font></p>
