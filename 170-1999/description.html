  Description</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"Postmodernism" has become, 
  with its adoption by the popular media, one of those words that everyone uses 
  but no one is quite able to define. It seems to have something to do with kitsch, 
  something to do with pastiche, something to do with fragmentation and discontinuity. 
  But is it a style, a form, or a period? In short: is "postmodernism" a thing? 
  Or, as many critics and theorists argue, is it in fact many things, a term so 
  multiple in its meanings as to be evacuated of all content? Our path through 
  this course will first lead us to confront the core of what has been called 
  "the postmodern debate," followed by an attempt at mapping the borders of the 
  postmodern. Then we'll begin violating those boundaries, testing our definitions 
  through its multiple variants. To this end, we'll examine a wide variety of 
  texts, both those traditionally identified as "postmodern" and those usually 
  given other labels, such as "postcolonial." Through this investigation, we'll 
  try to determine whether the amalgamation of concepts and theories surrounding 
  this contested, ambiguous term is useful to the reading of a certain kind -- 
  or kinds -- of post-World War II fiction. </font> </p>
