  Requirements and Grading</font> </h3>
<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Attendance and Participation:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  As our work here will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness 
  are indispensable, and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; 
  each additional unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. <b>(10%)</b> 
  </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Class Facilitation and 
  Reading Responses:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  Each student will be responsible for facilitating one class session, helping 
  direct our discussion on the readings you select or are assigned. This presentation 
  will require you to lead a Web Crossings discussion in the days prior to your 
  in-class presentation. The presentation itself should be no more than fifteen 
  minutes long, and should be formally prepared and delivered. More details about 
  this assignment will be forthcoming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Moreover, each student 
  will be responsible for participating in each week's Web Crossings discussion, 
  contributing questions and ideas that require further attention during class. 
  While you will only be required to post once each week, posting more often is 
  better. <b>(15% total)</b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Informal Writing:</font></b><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
  You will be required to produce some brief piece of informal writing for nearly 
  every class. Most of this work will be aimed at generating ideas for your formal 
  papers. While these pieces of writing will not be individually graded, they 
  will all be read, and they will receive an overall grade. <b>(15% total)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Papers:</b> During the 
  semester, you will write and revise four 4-to-6 page papers, each of which makes 
  an argument about some aspect of the material we have covered. While we will 
  suggest possible topics for these papers, you are strongly encouraged to choose 
  subjects that interest you. All papers must use proper MLA format. <i>Late papers 
  will only be accepted by prior arrangement.</i> Again, more details to follow.
