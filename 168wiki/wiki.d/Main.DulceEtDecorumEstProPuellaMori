text=How oft when men are at the point of death\\%0aHave they been merry! which their keepers call\\%0aA lightning before death: O, how may I\\%0aCall this a lightning? O my [[love]]! my wife!\\%0aDeath, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\\%0aHath had no power yet upon thy beauty:\\%0aThou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet\\%0aIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\%0aAnd death's pale flag is not advanced there.\\%0aTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\%0aO, what more favour can I do to thee,\\%0aThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\%0aTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\\%0aForgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,\\%0aWhy art thou yet so fair? shall I believe\\%0aThat unsubstantial death is amorous,\\%0aAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\%0aThee here in dark to be his paramour?\\%0aFor fear of that, I still will stay with thee;\\%0aAnd never from this palace of dim night\\%0aDepart again: here, here will I remain\\%0aWith worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here\\%0aWill I set up my everlasting rest,\\%0aAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\%0aFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\\%0aArms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\\%0aThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\%0aA dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\%0aCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!\\%0aThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\%0aThe dashing rocks thy [[sea-sick]] weary bark!\\%0aHere's to my [[love]]!\\\%0a%0afrom ''Romeo and Juliet''\\%0a%25center%25William Shakespeare
