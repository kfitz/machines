text=Sometimes at night during goodnight circle we would sing this song.  It's always sad, but it's even sadder when we sing it on the last few nights of camp.   Sometimes on these days I thought I should be crying but I wouldn't be, so I would think about this song.\\\%0a%0a%0a%0a%25center%25[[Fritz|M]]

The last two songs are always the same.  When I first starting going to camp at age seven, we sang songs about the moon and other lighthearted topics.  As I got older, the songs got deeper and darker.  I learned this song when I was an intermediate (approximately 11 years old).  Learning this song was a sort off rite of passage at my camp--the mark of growing up, as cheesy as it sounds.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
