Eliot%0a%0a%0aS`io credesse che mia risposta fosse\\%0aA persona che mai tornasse al mondo,\\%0aQuesta fiamma staria senza piu scosse. \\%0aMa perciocche giammai di questo fondo \\%0aNon torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero, \\%0aSenza tema d'infamia ti rispondo. \\%0aLet us go then, you and I, \\%0aWhen the evening is spread out against the sky \\%0aLike a patient etherized upon a table; \\%0aLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets, \\%0aThe muttering retreats \\%0aOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels \\%0aAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells \\%0aStreets that follow like a tedious argument \\%0aOf insidious intent \\%0aTo lead you to an overwhelming question... \\%0aOh, do not ask, `` What is it? '' \\%0aLet us go and make our visit. \\%0a%0aIn the room the women come and [[go]] \\%0aTalking of Michelangelo. \\%0a%0a%0aThe yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes \\%0aThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes \\%0aLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening. \\%0aLingered upon the pools that stand in drains. \\%0aLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys. \\%0aSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, \\%0aAnd seeing that it was a soft October night, \\%0aCurled once about the house, and fell asleep. \\%0a%0a%0aAnd indeed there will be time \\%0aFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street, \\%0aRubbing its back upon the window-panes; \\%0aThere will be time, there will be time \\%0aTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; \\%0aThere will be time to murder and create, \\%0aAnd time for all the works and days of hands \\%0aThat lift and drop a question on your plate; \\%0aTime for you and time for me. \\%0aAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions, \\%0aAnd for a hundred visions and revisions, \\%0aBefore the taking of a toast and tea. \\%0a%0a%0aIn the room the women come and [[go]] \\%0aTalking of Michelangelo. \\%0a%0a%0aAnd indeed there will be time \\%0aTo wonder, ``[[Do I dare?]]'' and, ``[[Do I dare?]]'' \\%0aTime to turn back and descend the stair, \\%0aWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair-- \\%0a[They will say: ``How his hair is growing thin!''] \\%0aMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, \\%0aMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin-- \\%0a[They will say: ``But how his arms and legs are thin!''] \\%0aDo I dare \\%0aDisturb the universe? \\%0aIn a minute there is time \\%0aFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. \\%0a%0a%0aFor I have known them all already, known them all: \\%0aHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, \\%0aI have measured out my life with coffee spoons; \\%0aI know the voices dying with a dying fall \\%0aBeneath the music from a farther room. \\%0a        So how should I presume? \\%0a%0a%0aAnd I have known the eyes already, known them all-- \\%0aThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, \\%0aAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, \\%0aWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, \\%0aThen how should I begin \\%0aTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? \\%0a        And how should I presume? \\%0a%0a%0aAnd I have known the [[http://armsmounts.com/|arms]] already, known them all-- \\%0a[[http://armsmounts.com/|Arms]] that are braceleted and white and bare \\%0a[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!] \\%0aIs it perfume from a dress \\%0aThat makes me so digress?

I grow old . . . \\%0aI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. \\%0a%0a%0aShall I part my hair behind?
