Description:</FONT></FONT></CENTER>



<BLOCKQUOTE>This class will explore two dominant themes in the development

of the novel over the last thirty years:&nbsp; conspiracy and atomization,

on the one hand, and the search for (and even the successful development

of) community on the other.&nbsp; We’ll primarily, though not exclusively,

focus on the American novel, both those texts considered “canonical,” as

well as those from emergent voices.&nbsp; Over the course of the semester,

we’ll hope to draw some conclusions about the cultural climate of the late

twentieth century, the meaning or lack thereof of the “postmodern,” and

the present status of those bastions of the humanities (the novel, the

author, the individual) that seem so endangered in the age of the computer.

<P>But we’ll call that technological threat into question by using computer

technologies to facilitate this exploration.&nbsp; Following the theories

elaborated by George Landow in Hypertext 2.0, we’ll use hypertext as a

means of modeling the kind of intertextual reading that the postmodern

novel demands.&nbsp; This hypertext work will culminate in the development

of web-based projects that will lay the groundwork for a new web site,

tentatively entitled <B>Postmodernism is/in Fiction</B>.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<CENTER><A NAME="Course Format"></A><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Course

Format:</FONT></FONT></CENTER>



<BLOCKQUOTE><B>This course is not a lecture course</B>.&nbsp; Instead,

our work together will revolve around discussion, both in class and via

Web Crossings, oral presentations, and group projects.&nbsp; To facilitate

this work,

<B>I will be splitting the class into two groups </B>after the

third meeting.&nbsp; Half will meet for seminar-style discussion and presentations

on Mondays, and the other half on Wednesdays.&nbsp; During the class period

when you do not meet with me, you will meet either with Shasta for computer

lab work or with one another for team project work.&nbsp; We’ll come together

as a large group for presentations at mid-term and at the end of the semester.

<P>There’s a catch here, of course:&nbsp; because our work this semester

will be so dependent on the work of everyone else in the class, your participation

and preparedness are indispensable, and will be graded.&nbsp; You will

be permitted <B>one unexcused absence</B>; each further absence will lower

your final grade.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<CENTER><A NAME="Assignments and Grades"></A><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>Assignments

and Grades:</FONT></FONT></CENTER>



<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Attendance and participation:</B>&nbsp; See above. <B>(10%)</B>

<P><B>Web Crossings responses and discussion:&nbsp;</B> Our discussions

of each novel we read will originate on the class Web Crossings site (and

hopefully continue there after we’ve met!).&nbsp; Each group will have

its own folder; each week, one member of the group will be responsible

for posting some careful, considered questions or thoughtful responses

to the reading, at least 48 hours in advance of class time.&nbsp; Between

that time and noon the day of our in-class discussion, every other member

of the group will be required to respond in some fashion, whether with

suggested interpretations or further questions.&nbsp; These writings will

not be graded individually, but they are <B>required</B>, and they will

result in one cumulative response grade, based on the thoughtfulness and

insight they represent.&nbsp; <B>(15%)</B>

<P><B>Oral Presentation:&nbsp; </B>Each student will facilitate the in-class

discussion on the week they lead the Web Crossings discussion, by opening

the class with a ten-minute presentation on the novel.&nbsp; The orientation

of this presentation is open to the individual student’s discretion, and

may revolve around the novel’s historical or factual background, the critical

response to the text, or any theoretical or interpretive approach to the

novel that will foster interesting discussion.&nbsp; Two things are discouraged,

however:&nbsp; the presentations should not focus on biographical criticism

(though some information about the author may be interesting, we’re far

more interested in the text than in the writer), and the presentations

should not rehash the work already done on Web Crossings.&nbsp; <B>(15%)</B>

<P><B>Two Short Web Assignments:&nbsp; </B>These two assignments will begin

the work that will culminate in your final project.&nbsp; The first will

ask you to select the novel you want to work with over the course of the

semester (which may or may not be the novel upon which you present), choose

a crucial piece of text from that novel, and do a preliminary hypertext

markup, creating links that provide a way of read that text that illuminates

the novel as a whole.&nbsp; The links you create in this assignment will

be crafted from your own critical writing.&nbsp; The second assignment

will ask you to compile an annotated bibliography/webography for the novel

you are working with, finding and presenting critical, theoretical, and

other secondary sources that illuminate your text.&nbsp; You will post

this work on a Web Crossings page, to which your peers will respond.&nbsp;

Further instructions on each assignment will be posted on the class web

site two weeks before they are due.&nbsp;<B> (15% each)</B>

<P><B>Final Web-Based Project:&nbsp;</B> In this project, you have free

reign; the two short web assignments will provide key pieces, but by no

means all, of the material you require.&nbsp; This project should be revealing,

engaging, and dazzling.&nbsp; We’ll talk more about the criteria for this

project as the semester progresses; as an example of this type of work,

however, you should study the Pynchon web site developed by Brian Stonehill’s

students (<A HREF="http://www.pomona.edu/pynchon">http://www.pomona.edu/pynchon</A>).&nbsp;

Your final grade on this project will be assessed by your peers based on

their examination of your work and your presentation of it at the end of

the semester.&nbsp;<B> (20%)</B>

<P><B>Peer Evaluations:&nbsp;</B> You will be called upon, as noted above,

to assess your peers’ performance, assisting in the determination of their

grades.&nbsp; For the oral presentation, the first assignment, and the

final project, you will fill out an evaluation sheet with a grade and turn

it in to me; Shasta and I will distill the information from the class and

present it to the student without evaluators’ names attached.&nbsp; For

the second assignment, you will comment directly upon the student’s Web

Crossings page, and Shasta and I will determine grades.&nbsp; More information

on this process will follow.&nbsp; <B>(10%)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>



<CENTER><A NAME="Tech Note"></A><FONT COLOR="#009900"><FONT SIZE=+1>A Note

on Technology:</FONT></FONT></CENTER>



<BLOCKQUOTE>If you’ve never done any web-page work, don’t know HTML, and

haven’t a clue what a hypertext might look like, here’s the first rule:&nbsp;

don’t freak out.&nbsp; Shasta is here to instruct and assist with the technology

as needed.&nbsp; I’m available and happy to brainstorm or troubleshoot

with you.&nbsp; You’ll spend time in the computer lab (with and without

Shasta) on the day you’re not in class, and in some classes we’ll talk

about theories of hypertext and issues of web site assessment.&nbsp; But

make sure you take an active stance toward learning what you need to know

in order to complete your assignments.&nbsp; Look to your peers for support

— the woman next to you may well be a web whiz.&nbsp; And though your final

projects will largely represent individual work, you will be encouraged

to produce that work through collaboration with your classmates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
