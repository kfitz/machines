<DIV class="PAR">In the novel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez presents the idea that history is defined not by events but by individuals, and Ursula is no exception. The insomnia disease did not just happen to the village, but was actually spread by her. Events do not happen in the novel, rather individuals cause events. The novel suggests the problem that history is written around events instead of people by carefully mirroring portions of Latin American history. Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez goes into great detail here; Aureliano Buend&iacute;a selects the title "Colonel", as was typically done by enlisted soldiers who in the midst of rebellions and coups found themselves in positions of power. This suggests, as Johnston maintains, that history and time exist in duality. On one hand, they are linear, in that the progression of events is ordered and causal. On the other hand, they are circular in that everything exists in cycles, particularly Ursula. This is exhibited climatically in the passage preceeding her death. She oscillates between extremes of aged, weakened senility to youthful, exuberant activity which, according to McNerney, serves to "reinforce [the novel's] circularity (39).</DIV>
