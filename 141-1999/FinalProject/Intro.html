<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">The purpose of this page is two-fold: first, to explore <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude</I> in terms of the individual, specifically Ursula, and second, to attempt to tie this novel and those themes to other novels in the post-modern canon.  We approached this task by examining the text as Ursula both experiences and defines it; how external events and people combine with her own thoughts to produce the concept she has of herself, how she is representative of the novel as a whole and what this means. The themes we considered in relation to Ursula were History, Gender, Magical Realism, Progress and Death. The page is designed to be explored in pieces, and not necessarily in a linear fashion. Enjoy.</DIV>
