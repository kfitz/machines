<DIV class="PAR">The only reliable method of protecting one's identity is denying all ideas and forces which potentially conflict with it.  Through all of the change and devastation which effects Macondo Ursula maintains her identity.  However, Ursula's inability to salvage her village results from her decision to reject outside forces.  Thus, embracing foreign forces is potentially devastating to the self.  However, this method is the only manner by which one can advance or improve oneself.</DIV>
