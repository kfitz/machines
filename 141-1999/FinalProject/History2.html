<DIV class="HEADER2">Ursula and History, part II</DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">This leads to the question of whether or not the cyclical behavior of Ursula and the novel's other characters is positive or negative. One school of thought, as exhibited by Conniff, Mose and Deveny and Marcos, is that the Buendias are trapped in "circles of fate," doomed to repeat themselves futilely. Ursula dies in this futility, attempting with her last burst of energy to behave exactly as she has always done. The other school, exhibited by Huston, maintains that only in the cyclical behavior is there any hope for change. By repeating herself, Ursula has a gauge by which to measure any differences. A further part of the learning process is the recognition of cyclicality and how it is exhibited on many levels. Ursula's life is a microcosm of the Buend&iacute;a family, the town of Macondo, and Latin America in general. By using certain individuals and events as metaphors for others, Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez is able to contract and expand time at his leisure.</DIV>
