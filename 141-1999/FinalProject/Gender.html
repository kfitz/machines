<DIV class="HEADER2">Ursula and Gender</DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">Ursula believes the duties of women include sweeping and cleaning, not military or political affairs.  Throughout the text the matriarch of the Buendia's leaves warfare and politics to the Buendia men, and encourages her daughters to remain within the home.  John Deveny Jr. and Juan Manuel Marcos claim that Ursula, who represents the "paradigm of feminine virtues", legitimizes the patriarchal and misogynistic society found within Latin America. The Buendia matriarch may discourage the advancement of women.  However, Deveny and Marcos's argument focuses more upon Marquez's political agenda than Ursula's psyche.  Ursula posses a steadfast value system.  She idealizes an utopian agrarian community in which men work the fields and women maintain the home. Just as Ursula resists and technological innovation in Macondo, she also resists any sociological change.  Traditional gender roles are one aspect of Ursula's resolute identity.</DIV>
