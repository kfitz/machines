<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">In <I>Midnight's Children,</I> Rushdie exhibits a similar stance on the recording of history to Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's. One has the definite sense that as much as Saleem would lead the reader to believe otherwise, he is responsible for the events of the novel, rather than they merely occurring. Additionally, Rushdie expands on a commentary Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez presents on the nature of recorded history and how it can be manipulated by the historian. Similar to the forgetting and remembering in <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude,</I> Saleem merely tells what he wants how he feels like telling it; he even admits on occasion that what he has just related was false. As for Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, the repetitiveness of history and learning from that  is significant for Rushdie.</DIV>
