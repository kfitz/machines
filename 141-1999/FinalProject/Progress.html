<DIV class="HEADER2">Ursula and Progress</DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR"> Ursula resists progress.  From the time Jose Arcadio Buendia trades the families animals for two magnetized ingots, Ursula questions change and innovation within the village (2).  Literary critic Brian Conniff argues that the Buendia's obsession with science, technology and the future lead to the exploitation of the family and their village.  Ursula understands the consequences of progress. The matriarch observes how her husband's obsession with new inventions transform him from a hard-working farmer into a lazy social outcast (10).  Thus, her expulsion of the gypsies from Macondo (42) is Ursula's attempt to preserve her happy, hard-working village.  As the matriarch of Macondo, Ursula's own identity is closely linked with that of her village. Ursula attempts to preserve her vision of a village utopia: a contented, simple community. Outsiders eventually penetrate Macondo and exploit the Buendias. Regardless of whether innovation causes exploitation Ursula's ideas about Macondo's future remain steadfast. Ursula rejects progress, technology and all other forces which threaten her ideal village.</DIV>
