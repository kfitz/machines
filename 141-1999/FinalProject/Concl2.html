<DIV class="HEADER2">A Few Last Words, Part II</DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">Despite numerous divisive forces in One Hundred Years of Solitude, Ursula never questions her identity.  Progress and technology, rebellious women who challenge traditional gender roles, the process of rewriting and forgetting history, Catholicism, and the various methods of perceiving Magical Realism threaten Ursula.  Nevertheless, the old woman's ideals and values remain resolute.  Ursula maintains her image of herself as the guardian of utopian Macondo.  She unconditionally rejects any forces which threaten to alter the small, traditional agrarian village which her husband founded.</DIV>
