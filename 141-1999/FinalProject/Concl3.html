<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">Does Ursula's insistence upon maintaining her identity prove successful?  Ultimately Ursula's attempt to sustain utopian Macondo fails.  Catholicism, alteration of history, and "progress" brought by outsiders undermine her ideal and lead to exploitation and destruction.  Perhaps Ursula could have prevented Macondo's fate if she compromised some of her stalwart beliefs.  Richard Powers' accepted technology and learned to incorporate such ideas into his own belief system.  However, outside forces ultimately leave some characters, such as the narrator of "The Locked Room", with no sense of themselves whatsoever (351).  Thus, accepting outside influences is not without its dangers.</DIV>
