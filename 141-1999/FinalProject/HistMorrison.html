<DIV class="PAR">As a dedicated reader of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Morrison exhibits some striking similarities in her work. In many ways, the residents of Ruby and the residents of Macondo are very much alike. Both are searchers who discovered and founded their towns, both become "corrupted" by progress, and, among other things, both seem trapped in their history. Discarding the burden of a people's history and breaking out of the same cycle of behavior is extremely important for Morrison, much as freeing oneself from the cycle of solitude is the crux for Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.</DIV>
