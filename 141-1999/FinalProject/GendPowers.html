<DIV class="PAR">Richard Powers' confronts his patriarchal biases towards literature and society.  During an argument with A, the young student calls Powers' traditional literary cannon outdated and asserts the emergence of feminist literature.  Powers' exposure to A and her non-traditional ideas cause dismay in the humanist. "I sounded ridiculous.  Hurt, and worse hating how I sounded and trying to disguise it (284)."  Ideas which conflict with Powers' patriarchal traditional impinge upon his own identity.  By the end of the discussion Powers' maintains his faith in "the classics" and seems to dismiss the feminine tradition, patronizing A: "That's Mr. Author function to you, missy (286).  Ursula's experience with changing gender roles, like Powers' exposure to feminist literature, encroaches upon their own identities.  Although Powers' does listen to A.'s arguments, both reject ideas about gender and society, protecting their own values and beliefs.</DIV>
