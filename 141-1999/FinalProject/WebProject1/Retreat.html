		<DIV class="HEAD">--Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo Retreats--</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">&#218rsula fails to end her great-grandson's solitude.  Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo's fear prevents any hope of ending the solitude.  His anxiety stems from the railroad which represents Macondo's interaction with outsiders, technology and capitalism.  Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo's refusal to leave his room gives insight into M&#225rquez's ideas about Latin American and its isolation.  Latin American nations, like Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo, resent Western imperialism's exploitation of their land.  Rather than construct a successful Latin American version of Western capitalism, utilizing available technology, nations remain isolated.  Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo is content to isolate himself from the imperialists and their methods, in a sense denying their existence. &#218rsula leaves her great-grandson's room defeated, realizing the solitude is "impenetrable".  The cycle of poverty in Latin American will remain "impenetrable" until countries acknowledge Western capitalism.  Perhaps M&#225rquez does not necessarily advocate the adoption of Western style capitalism in Latin American.  Nevertheless undeveloped nations can never hope to compete with imperialist countries until they confront the success of such powers.</DIV>
