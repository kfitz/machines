		<DIV class="PAR">A brief note to mention a comparison to Don DeLillo's <I>White Noise</I>-- reality is again blurred and defined by representation. Much like Jack's acceptance of death because the computer informed him he was dead, &#218rsula accepts what she believes to be a state of death because the children jokingly discuss how dead she is. Also note the further effect of her spiraling: she is far more alive in her incoherent mumblings and reaction to the children than she was as a shrunken fetus. Another cycle?</DIV>
