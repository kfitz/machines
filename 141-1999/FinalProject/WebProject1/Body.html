The waves of lucidity that were so scarce during rains became frequent after August, when an arid wind began to blow and suffocated the rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended up scattering over Macondo the burning dust that covered the rusted zinc roofs and the age-old almond trees forever. &#218rsula cried in lamentation when she discovered that for more than three years she had been a plaything for the children.  She washed her painted face, took off the strips of brightly colored cloth, and dried lizards and frogs, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces that they hung all over her body, and for the first time since the death of Amaranta she got up out of bed without anybody's help to join the family life once more.

She did not need to see tot realize that the flower beds, cultivated with such care since the first rebuilding, had been destroyed by the rain and walls and cement of the floors were cracked, the furniture mushy and discolored, the doors off their hinges, and the family menaced by a spirit of resignation and despair that was inconceivable in her time.  Feeling her way along through the empty bedrooms she perceived the continuos rumble of the termites as they carved the wood, the snipping of the moths in the clothes closets, and the devastating noise of the enormous red ants that had prospered during the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house.  One day she opened the trunk with the saints and had to ask Santa Sof&#237a de la Piedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped out and that had already turned the clothing to dust.  "A person can't live in neglect like this," she said.  "If we go on like this we'll be devoured by animals."  From then on she did not have a moment of repose.  Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the children.  She put the few articles of clothing still usable out into the sun, she drove the cockroaches off with the powerful insecticide attacks, she scratched out the veins that the termites had made on doors and windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills with quicklime.  The fever of restoration finally brought her to the forgotten rooms.  She cleared out the rubble and cobwebs in the room where Jos&#233 Arcadio Buend&#237a had lost his wits looking for philosopher's stone, she put the silver shop which had been upset by the soldiers in order, and lastly she asked for the keys to Melqu&#237ades room to see what state it was in.  Faithful to the wishes of Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo, who had forbidden anyone to come in unless there was a clear indication that he had died, Santa Sof&#237a de la Piedad tried all kinds of subterfuges to throw &#218rsula off the track.  But so inflexible was her determination not to surrender even the most remote corner of the house to the insects that she knocked down every obstacle in her path, and after three days of insistence she succeeded in getting them to open the door for her.  She had to old on to the doorjamb so that the stench would not knock her over, but she needed only two seconds to remember that the schoolgirls' seventy-two chamber pots were in there and that on one of the rainy nights a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo and had been unable to find him. </DIV>

		<DIV class="PAR">Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo was still reading over the parchments.  The only thing visible in the intricate triangle of hair was the teeth striped with green slime and his motionless eyes.  When he recognized his great-grandmother's voice he turned his head toward the door, tried to smile, and without knowing it repeated an old phrase of &#218rsula's. </DIV>

But even then she did not give resignation a chance.  She scolded Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo as if he were a child and insisted that he take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house.  The simple idea of abandoning the room that had given him peace terrified Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo.  He shouted that there was no human power capable of making him go out because he did not want to see the train with two hundred cars loaded with dead people which left Macondo every day at dusk on its way to the sea.

She left him in the room, but she succeeded in getting them to leave the padlock off, clean it every day, throw the chamberpots away except for one, and to keep Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as his great-grandfather had been during his long captivity under the chestnut tree.  At first Fernanda interpreted that bustle as an attack of senile madness and it was difficult for her to suppress her exasperation.  But about that time Jos&#233 Arcadio told her that he planned to come to Macondo form Rome before taking his final vows, and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen watering flowers four times a day so that her son would not have a bad impression of the house.  It was the same incentive which induced her to speed up her correspondence with the invisible doctors and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano and begonias on the porch even before &#218rsula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureliano Segundo's exterminating fury.  Later on she sold the silver service and bought ceramic dishes, pewter bowls and soup spoons, and alpaca tablecloth, and with them brought poverty to the cupboards that had been accustomed to India Company chinaware and Bohemian crystal. &#218rsula always tried to go a step beyond.  "Open the windows and the doors." she shouted.  "Cook some meat and fish, buy the largest turtles around, let strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and sit down to at as many times as they want, and belch and rant and muddy everything with their boots, and let them do whatever they want to us, because that's the only way to drive off ruin."  But it was a vain illusion.  She was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the miracle of the little candy animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength.  The house stayed closed on Fernanda's orders.</DIV>

		<DIV class="PAR">Aureliano Segundo, who had taken his trunks back to the house of Petra Cotes, barely had enough means to see that the family did not starve to death. With the raffling of the mule, Petra Cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lottery business. Aureliano Segundo would go from house to house selling the tickets that he himself painted with colored ink to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he did not realize that many people them out of gratitude and most of them out of pity. Nevertheless, even the most pitying purchaser was getting a chance to win a pig for twenty cents of a calf for thirty-two, and they becamse so hopeful that on Tuesday nights Petra Cotes's courtyard oberflowed with people waiting for the moment when a child picked at random drew the winning number from a bag. It did not take long to become a weekly fair, for at dusk food and drink stands would be set up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had won right there on the condition that someone else supply the liquor and music, so that without having wanted to, Aureliano Segundo suddenly found himself, playing the accordion again and participating in modest tourneys of voracity. Those humble replicas of the revelry of former times served to show Aureliano Segundo himself how much his spirits had declined and to what a degree his skill as a masterful carouser had dried up. He was a changed man. The two hundred forty pounds that he had attained during the days when he had been challenged by The Elephant had been reduced to one hundred fifty-six; the glowing and bloated tortoised face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was always on the verge or boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he had never been a better man than at that time, perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love, and because of the feeling of solidarity that misery aroused in both of them. The broken-down bed ceased to be the scene of wild activities and was changed into an intimate refuge. Freed of the repetitious mirrors, which had been auctioned off to buy animals for the lottery, and from the lewd damasks and velvets, which the mule had eaten, they would stay up very late with the innocence of two sleepless grandparents, taking advantage of the time to draw up accounts and put away pennies which they formerly wasted just for the sake of it. Sometimes the cock's crow would find them piling and unpiling coins, taking a bit away from here to put there, so that this bunch would be enough to keep Fernanda happy and that would be for Amaranta &#218rsula's shoes, and that other one for Santa Sof&#237a de la Piedad, who had not had a new dress since the time of all the noise, and this to order the coffin if &#218rsula died, and this for the coffee whic was going up a cent a pound in price every three months, and this for the sugar which sweetened less every day, and this for the lumber which was still wet from the rains, and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets with, and what was left over to pay off thewinner of the April calf whose hide they had miraculously saved when it came down with a symptomatic carbuncle just when all of the numbers in the raffle had already been sold.

		<DIV class="MAIN">so pure that they nearly always set aside the largest share for Fernanda, and they did not do so out of remorse or charity, but because her well-being was more important to them than their own. What was really happening to them, although neither of them realized it, was that they both thought of Fernanda as the daughter that they would have liked to have and never did, to the point where on a certain occasion they resigned themselves to eating frumbs for three days so that she could buy a Dutch tablecloth. Nevertheless, no matter how much they killed themselves with work, no matter how much money they eked out, and no matter how many schemes they thought of, their guardian angels were asleep with fatigue while they put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with. During the waking hours when the acounts were bad, they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed with the same drive as before, why money slipped through their fingers, and why people who a short time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousing considered it highway robbery to charge twelve cents for a raffle of six hens. Aurelian Segundo thought without saying so that the evil was not in the world but in some hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had happened during the deluge that had turned the animals sterile and made money scarce.Intrigued by that enigma, he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs. </DIV>

At first Aureliano Segundo would spend three days of the week shut up in what had been his rancher's office drawing ticket after ticket, painting with a fair skill a red cow, a green pig, or a group of blue hens, according to the animal being raffled, and he would sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that Petra Cotes thought good to call the business: <I>Divine Providence Raffles</I>. But with time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers put on rubber stamps, and then the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors. In his last years it occurred to him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who guessed it, but the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that he gave it up after the second attempt.</DIV>	</TD>

Fernanda put Amaranta &#218rsula in a small private school where they admitted only six girls, but she refused to allow Aureliano to go to public school. She considered that she had already relented too much in letting him leave the room. Besides, the schools in those days accepted only the legitimate offspring of Catholic marriages and on the birth certificate that had been pinned to Aureliano's clothing when they brought him to the house he was registered as a foundling. So he remained shut in at the mercy of Santa Sof&#237a de la piedad's loving eyes and &#218rsula's mental quirks, learning in the narrow world of the house whatever his grandmothers explained to him. He was delicate, thin, with a curiosity that unnerved the adults, but unlike the inquisitive and sometimes clairvoyant look that the colonel had at his age, his look was blinking and somewhat distracted. While Amaranta &#218rsula was in kindergarten, he would hunt earthworms and torture insects in the garden. But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to put in &#218rsula's bed, she locked him up in Meme's old room, where he spent his solitary hours looking through the pictures in the encyclopedia. &#218rsula found him there one afternoon when she was going about sprinkling the house with distilled water and a bunch of nettles and in spite of the fact that she had been with him many times she asked him who he was. </DIV>

Aureliano Segundo tried to take advantage of her delirium to get her to tell him where the gold was buried, but his entreaties were useless once more.

		<DIV class="PAR">At first they thought it was a plague. Housewives were exhausted from sweeping away so many dead birds, especially at siesta time, and the men dumped them into the river by the cartload. On Easter Sunday the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel stated from the pulpit that the death of the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew, whom he himself had seen the night before. He described him as a cross between a billy goat and a female heretic, an infernal beast whose breath scorched the air and whose look brought on the birth of monsters in newlywed women. There were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk, for the town was convinced that the priest was rambling because of his age. But one woman woke everybody up at dawn on Wednesday because she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof. They were se clear and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had no doubt about the existence of a fearsome creature similar to the one described by the parish priest and they got together to set traps in their courtyards. That was how they managed to capture it. Two weeks after &#218rsula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo woke up frightened by the especially loud bellowing of a calf that was coming from nearby. When they got there a group of men were already pulling the monster off the sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves, and it stopped lowing. It was as heavy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a young steer, and a green and greasy liquid flowed from its wounds. Its body was covered with rough hair, plagued with small ticks, and the skin was hardened with the scales of a remora fish, but unlike the priest's description, its human parts were more like those of a sickly angel than of a man, for its hands were tense and agile, its eyes large and gloomy, and on its shoulderblades it had the scarred-over and calloused stumps of powerful wings which must have been chopped off by a woodsman's ax. They hung it to an almond tree in the square by its ankles so that everyon could see it, and when it began to rot they burned it in a bonfire, for they could not determine whether its bastard nature was that of an animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried. It was never dstablished whether it had really caused the death of the birds, but the newly married women did not bear the predicted monsters, nor did the intensity of the heat decrease. </DIV>
