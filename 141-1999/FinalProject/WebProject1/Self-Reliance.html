		<DIV class="PAR">Here M&#225rquez further explores a prevalent theme, the identity of Latin America and how to solve her problems. He presents a positive image of Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes finding happiness and a living -- albeit an impoverished one -- through their own entrepeneurial skills. Where as &#218rsula's desire to revitalize the house by allowing strangers in to exploit them suggests Latin America's attempt at economic renewal through external imperialism, the lottery seems to represent Latin America achieving success through self-reliance. It is important to note the couple's contentment in their own poverty as a realization and acceptance of their identities.</DIV>
