		<DIV class="HEAD">--Ursula's Rebirth--</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">Following the rains &#218rsula emerges revitalized.  The matriarch of Macondo family perseveres through her "insane state of confusion" (353), in which found herself a play thing for children.  Following her rebirth, &#218rsula strives to regenerate Macondo which, like her, was ravaged by the rains.  The old woman's battle with the cockroaches symbolizes the newly reborn &#218rsula's attempt to revitalize her town.  Throughout Marquez's text, &#218rsula emerges from disasters energetic and determined to recreate prosperity in Macondo.  Following the insomnia plague, which ravages the townspeople's memories (52), &#218rsula, despite her increasing age, appears more productive and resolute than before: "She had reached an age when she had the right to rest, but she was nonetheless more and more active" (59).  Marquez presents cycles of destruction and rebirth throughout <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude.</I> &#218rsula exemplifies this cycle.  Although the woman ages and progressively becomes senile she emerges from the rubble of every disaster revitalized.  In the cyclical history of Macondo &#218rsula leads the town out of plagues, wars and other inflictions.  However, the prosperity which the matriarch constructs does not persist and eventually the town suffers a disastrous consequence.  Thus, while &#218rsula attempts to cease Macondo's cycle of ruin she is also responsible for continuing the circle.</DIV>
