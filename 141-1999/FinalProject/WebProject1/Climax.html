		<DIV class="HEAD">--Religion, futility, and the cyclicality of failed efforts, life, death, and everything --</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">M&#225rquez reaches a climax in this selection with his treatment of the death of &#218rsula. Her passing itself is anti-climactic; for all that she has done for the village and the family, she is buried in a small coffin at a funeral few people attend. The reader is then instantly distracted from the passing of one of the novel's central characters by something as trivial as a heat wave and crazy birds.</DIV>
		<DIV class="PAR">It is here that M&#225rquez makes a clear, harsh, and sudden statement about religion. "On Easter Sunday the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel stated from the pulpit that the death of the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew..."(369) He begins his criticism with an overt contradiction. The "Wandering Jew" that was seen on the eve of Easter Sunday is clearly Christ, but to have evil attributed to him and further described as a monster by a priest suggests disgust with Catholicism in Latin America. Interestingly enough, the description of the beast upon its capture is reminiscent of the fallen Satan in John Milton's <I>Paradise Lost.</I></DIV>
		<DIV class="PAR"> M&#225rquez's biggest criticism of the Church is that, like the methods exhibited earlier by Aureliano Segundo and &#218rsula, religion has become a crutch for Latin America to attempt to escape its situation.<B>*</B> One possible reading here is that the reader has lost track of &#218rsula because she has entered a new cycle as the beast. She is a Christ-like figure throughout much of the novel in her efforts to save the family and the village. Unlike the Christ of the Bible, who is crucified and returns in glory, all her life's efforts and purpose are futile because she cannot break the cycles and so she dies ungracefully and rises on Easter Sunday as a monster. It is here that M&#225rquez's themes of failed Latin American efforts at success and the cyclicality of existence come crashing together in futility.</DIV>
