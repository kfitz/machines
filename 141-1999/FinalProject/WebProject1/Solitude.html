		<DIV class="HEAD">--&#218rsula's Attempt to Break the Solitude--</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">&#218rsula's attack against Macondo's devastation inevitably leads her to the room where Jos&#233 Arcadio Buend&#237a remains isolated.  This isolation represents the root of her familily's despair.  This scene reveals &#218rsula's understanding that time does not "pass", but instead continually repeats itself.  Her efforts to end Jos&#233 Arcadio Buend&#237a 's solitude demonstrate that ending the isolation is the only method by which the circle of devastation which inflicts Macondo can be interupted.  If M&#225rquez's text is a commentary upon Latin America the sentiment is clear.  Latin America's self-imposed solitude from the outside world causes a vicious cycle of poverty and exploitation.  &#218rsula represents an enlightened leader who understands that the solitude must end in order to gain genuine prosperity.</DIV>
