		<DIV class="HEAD">--Cycle of love--</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">Here we see the second of the two major themes expressed in this passage. M&#225rquez is intent in this selection on displaying the cyclicality of existence by blurring the lines between the cycles of life, death, love, and time, among others. The love described between Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes presents one such cycle. On one level, it parallels &#218rsula's life-death cycle described earlier. The lovers' relationship has reached a state of depth and happiness after a time of lust and stagnation, much like &#218rsula has a rebirth and renewal after a period of alienation and decay. "Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude."(365) Additionally, M&#225rquez makes a point of juxtaposing different characteristics. of what we think of as ideal companionship. The sexual progress of their relationship is expected, but their love takes on a youthful exuberance usually reserved for younger lovers. "Madly  in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs."(365) This only serves to further distort our concept of time.</DIV>
