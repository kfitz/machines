	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">Here &#218rsula's life/death cycles seem to be spiralling out of control. From her earlier catatonia the reader sees her emerge once again into vibrancy, then progress to mental failure and now her physical state degrades again. However, to further confuse life and death, &#218rsula becomes infantile in her later moments. She shrinks to a "fetus" and resembles a "newborn old woman." And of course her mental state degrades to where she is no longer interacting with the world.</DIV>
		<DIV class="PAR">Note how through the course of the novel and especially in this selection &#218rsula's life/death cycles become shorter and more frequent. Mathmatically, they are exponentially decreasing, as if with each cycle she moves half the remaining distance to some end. The result is she seems to spiral towards some terminus, but never quite makes it.</DIV>
