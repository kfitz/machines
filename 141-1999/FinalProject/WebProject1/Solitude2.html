	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">Finally the reader begins to see how even &#218rsula, the long-time foe of solitude in the men in the family, cannot break the cycle of repetition. Aureliano is confined to Meme's old room to study pictures in an encyclopedia -- a similar pastime as Jos&#233 Arcardio Segundo poring over Melqu&#237ades' parchments -- and the new generation of men has once again began the process of solitude, even if it is against their will. &#218rsula appears to have the opportunity to free him, but in her senility she casts him back into the role of the first Aureliano, and by association seems to doom him to repeat his ancestor's pattern.</DIV>
