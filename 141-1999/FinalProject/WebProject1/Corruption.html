		<DIV class="HEAD">--The Corruption of Aureliano Segundo's Lottery--</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">While Aureliano Segundo's lottery began as an original Macondo enterprise, ideas from the outside world eventually corrupt the flowering business.  Aureliano Segundo compromises his original raffle techniques and utilizes an assembly line similar to those used in Western capitalist nations.  The proprietor also uses gimmicks and gives his business a flashy title.  The name "Divine Providence Raffles" demonstrates corruption of not only lottery, but of Macondo.  "Divine Providence" is a reference to Macondo, which at the time of its inception was a promising utopia discovered by a few chosen settlers.  Macondo, like the Garden of Eden, was once a "Divine Providence."  Using the former promise of his town to sell raffle tickets pollutes any notion that Macondo can achieve its covenant.  The changes Aureliano Segundo makes to the small company doom the businessman.  "Divide Providence Raffles" disgraces Aureliano Segundo and he dies the subject of ridicule: "They finally lost respect for him, and in the last moths they no longer called him Don Aureliano, as they had always done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence right to his face" (378).  Aureliano Segundo's downfall demonstrates the consequences that Latin American nations face when they adopt Western capitalism.  Although Latin America must acknowledge outsiders, perhaps enterprises such as "Divine Providence Raffles" must operate according to a distinct Latin American model.</DIV>
