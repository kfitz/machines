		<DIV class="HEAD">--Fernanda and &#218rsula Try to Restore the Buendia House--</DIV>
	<BR>
		<DIV class="PAR">Acknowledging her failure to interupt the solitude, &#218rsula, along with her great-granddaughter-in-law, try another method to end the cycle of despair.  The Buend&#237a women's interest in further restoration of the house arises when Fernanda's son, Jos&#233 Arcadio announces he is returning from Europe.  Literary critic Brian Conniff contends that for Macondo's residents, "the important things have always happened some where else -and their future will be determined by somebody else."<B>*</B> Fernanda's "bustle" results from her understanding that her son, educated "somewhere else", is important to the future of the Buend&#237as.  While &#218rsula's attempt to break Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo's isolation was an active attempt by a Buend&#237a to change her town's fate, Fernanda's preparation for Jos&#233 Arcadio demonstrates reliance upon outsiders to effect Macondo's future.</DIV>
		<DIV class="PAR">Fernanda and &#218rsula's attempt to restore the household is an obvious metaphor for Latin American's futile efforts at prosperity.  Rather than acknowledge the success of Western imperialists and attempt to compete, Latin American nations survive by succumbing to exploitation.  Fernanda sells off the treasures of the Buend&#237a family.  This act compares to Spain and Portugal's plunder of the ancient Aztec and Inca empires. &#218rsula imagines further exploitation in the name of "driving off ruin." &#218rsula's vision of carousing outsiders, partying at the Buend&#237a's expense, parallels many modern day cities in Latin American, such as Tijuana.  These bastions of excess and vice succumb to the desires of Westerner's, hoping to benefit from foreign wealth. &#218rsula proposes the ugly scheme while remembering the success of her "candy animal" business.  Ironically, while lucrative, &#218rsula's candy animal endeavor eventually causes the insomnia plague: "Children and adults sucked with delight on the delicious little green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow ponies of insomnia, so that dawn on Monday found the whole town awake" (49).  Thus, Fernanda and &#218rsula's attempt to restore prosperity to the Buend&#237as is another endeavor doomed to culminate in devestation.  Once &#218rsula fails to end Jos&#233 Arcadio Segundo's isolation she must resort to the same ill-fated survival strategies which Macondo and Latin America continually rely upon.</DIV>
