		<DIV class="PAR">In &#218rsula's waning lucidity and waxing senility, M&#225rquez completely blurs the boundary between past and present. "She finally mixed up the past with the present in such a way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died, no one knew for certain whether she was speaking about what she felt or what she remembered."(367) Additionally, this distortion of time has two other secondary purposes. First, it makes a comment on the reality of perception. When M&#225rquez writes that the family could not discern whether &#218rsula was feeling or remembering events, he is really saying that the family could not discern what was real and what was imagined. Their own reality and perception of events is altered by hers. Second, M&#225rquez is once again emphasizing the repetition of events in that what she remembers is very similar to what she is actually experiencing.</DIV>
