<DIV class="HEADER2">Magical Realism in <I>Paradise</I></DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">Again, most likely due to her fascination with Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, magical realism is prominent in Morrison's work. In <I>Paradise</I> we see heavy use of altered reality in and around the Convent. Slightly differently from <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude,</I> this serves to make the point that reality -- and therefore history -- differ from beholder to beholder. The intial description in the novel of the Convent is given by the men from Ruby and is very different from the one that we eventually receive through the perspectives of others in the Convent.</DIV>
