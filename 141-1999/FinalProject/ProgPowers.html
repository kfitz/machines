<DIV class="PAR"> Progress infringes upon Richard Powers' identity.  The emergence of science and computers cause Powers to question his worth as a "humanist" and even as a human being (290).  Unlike Ursula, Powers' accepts progress.  He reluctantly joins the Center for the Study of Advanced Sciences and helps Lentz with his neural network project.  Nevertheless, Powers' emerges from his experience maintaining his belief in the importance of the traditional literary canon and values such as love. "It his me well after it should have.  The mind is still an evolutionary infant.  Most trouble with the obvious (290)." <I>Galatea 2.2</I> demonstrates why Ursula resists the inventions of Melquiades.  Progress and change encourage revaluation of individual's beliefs and ideals. Rejecting such changes are one method of maintaining identity.  Powers' experience reveals that one can accept progress and maintain identity.  Perhaps if Ursula allowed the gypsies in Macondo she could have retained the essence of her utopia, but implemented certain innovations.</DIV>
