<DIV class="HEADER2">Ursula and Magical Realism</DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">In one sentence, magical realism is a literary technique used frequently by Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez in which the line between the fantastical and the real is blurred such that the fantastical becomes and real and vice versa. Here we will concern ourselves most with how this functions in terms of Ursula. Mose maintains that magical realism "emphasizes the unique and remarkable." This functions as a commentary on history, but more so on the individual. If reality for Ursula and others becomes merely the unique and remarkable, then how is reality unique and remarkable? Ursula in particular seems almost to fight against the author and magical realism for the desire to hold on to perspective, while he seems to manipulate and toy with her using that same magical reality. Even she succumbs to pressure to define herself by the magical reality that she perceives. "Then Ursula gave in to the evidence. 'My God,' she exclaimed in a low voice. 'So this is what it's like to be dead.'" (368)</DIV>
