<DIV class="PAR">Characters in contemporary novels face various forces which encroach upon their individual identity.  As a result of modernity's emphasis upon science and technology, the protagonist of Richard Powers' Galatea 2.2 questions his devotion to "humanism" as well as his worth as a human (290).  The narrator of Paul Auster's "The Locked Room" discards his own identity because of his feelings of inadequacy and envy for his childhood friend, Fanshawe (247).  The conjunction of native and colonial society create problems for the characters of Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children and Jessica Hagedorn'sDogeaters, who no longer have a single country and culture to identify with.  Thus, political, social, and individual realties of modern society make characters question and re-evaluate themselves.</DIV>
