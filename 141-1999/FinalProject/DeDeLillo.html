<DIV class="PAR">DeLillo's characters fear death.  During Murray and Jack's exchange in the supermarket, the popular culture professor remarks that people go to great lengths to escape their death. "'It's obvious.  You know how to repress.  We're all aware there's no escape form death.  How we deal with this crushing knowledge?  We repress, we disguise, we bury, we exclude.  Some people do it better than others, that's all'" (288). DeLillo notes that society has developed numerous solutions to appease the fear of death, such as the idea of an afterlife.  These impossible solutions demonstrate that characters in <I>White Noise</I> reject their fate as human beings.  Ursula understands her death is imminent and accepts it.  Solutions such as an afterlife are present in <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude,</I> as Catholicism is a strong force.  Nevertheless, Ursula embraces her destiny.  Perhaps, society's intrusion into the individual create ideas which undermine the human life cycle.  Only characters with a resolute identity who understand their relationship to death can avoid the fear of mortality.</DIV>
