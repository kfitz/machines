<DIV class="HEADER2">Ursula and Death</DIV>
<BR>
<DIV class="PAR">Ursula accepts her death.  During the rains which haunt Macondo for four years, the old woman vows she will die after the storm.  Following the storm she "makes great effort to fulfill her promise to die (359)." By the end of her life Ursula understands the nature of life and time. "...Once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not passing, as she had just admitted, but that it was turning in a circle (361)."  She has witnessed generations of Buendia's fall in love, pursue their dreams, and ultimately die.  The old matriarch realizes that her death is as much a part of her identity as her dreams and values.  Once Ursula perceives her death as an aspect of herself the old woman embraces it.  Ursula never questions her identity nor her fate.  Just as Ursula attempts to preserve Macondo from outsiders, the old woman tries to fulfill her destiny and die.</DIV>
