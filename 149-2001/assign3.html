<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your final assignment is 
  to write a well-researched, thoughtful, critically astute, and above all <i>interesting</i> 
  analytical research paper on the cultural object of your choice, using some 
  form of Marxist/cultural analysis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your paper should make 
  a focused, insightful, well-elaborated, well-supported argument about the object 
  you select. That object may be film, television, music, or any other form of 
  popular culture. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition to addressing 
  your primary text, your paper must engage a minimum of THREE secondary texts. 
  At least two of these texts must be theoretical in nature; the others may be 
  theoretical or critical in nature, so long as your use of the secondary texts 
  is significant. In other words, your secondary texts must illuminate something 
  about the text you're discussing that is absolutely pertinent to your argument. 
  Moreover, two of the secondary texts you use may be writings we've read together; 
  at least one must represent further research you have done. Be sure, however, 
  that your paper does not devolve into a report on your research; the center 
  of this paper should be, as always, your own original thought. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This assignment involves 
  three requirements: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>1. Proposal:</b> On 
  <b>Tuesday, March 20</b>, you will hand in to me a 250-500 word (1-2 page, double-spaced) 
  statement of the argument that you intend to explore in your paper. This is 
  of course not to suggest that you will be tied to this argument, or that it 
  won't be affected by the research you will do. But this proposal should let 
  me know the basics of what you're interested in: the text you want to deal with, 
  the approach you intend to take, the conclusions you suspect you might reach 
  -- and, above all, why you're interested in this topic. This need not be a polished 
  piece of prose, but do give me as much information as you can; my feedback on 
  this proposal may be helpful in focusing your investigation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>2. Annotated bibliography:</b> 
  On <b>Thursday, March 29</b>, you will hand in to me an annotated bibliography, 
  letting me know the extent of the research you've done so far. This bibliography 
  must contain at least seven separate secondary texts (books, articles, etc.); 
  each entry must also contain a note from you (hence the &quot;annotated&quot; 
  part) about the text, explaining what this text is, what its basic argument 
  is, and how this item will benefit your investigation. Note that you will not 
  be required to cite all of the works you list in your paper, but this range 
  of texts should help you find secondary texts that genuinely illuminate your 
  argument, rather than simply fulfilling the secondary text requirement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>3. Paper:</b> The thing 
  itself. Which must, as always, use appropriate citation format, must conform 
  to the length guidelines above, and must -- MUST -- be carefully proofread. 
  Papers whose meaning is obscured by a plethora of typographical or spelling 
  errors will be returned unread, and will incur late penalties until resubmitted. 
  You should also make use of your friends, classmates, and the writing fellows 
  in refining both your ideas and your writing. To that end, there is a subsidiary 
  requirement: </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>3a. Peer review:</b> 
  On <b>Thursday, April 12</b>, you should hand a draft of your paper (in whatever 
  state of completion) to your peer review partner, and you should get a copy 
  of your partner's paper. I will leave it to you to pair yourselves up, but make 
  sure you speak with your partner soon. The two of you should compare notes as 
  you're working on your drafts, and should comment thoroughly and constructively 
  on the drafts themselves, helping one another to clarify writing issues, deepen 
  your analysis, and complicate your argument. These commented drafts must be 
  returned to the author on the following <b>Tuesday, April 17</b>, so that each 
  of you will have a week and a half to revise your papers as necessary. When 
  you turn in your final draft to me, <b>you must turn in the commented first 
  draft as well.</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>N<font color="660033">ote: 
  All deadlines are firm. No extensions will be granted.</font></b></font></p>
