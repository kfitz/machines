<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Assignment 
  1<br>
  Due Thursday, February 22</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Length: 8 pages (with 1" 
  margins, in 12-point Times)</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Your first major writing 
  assignment requires you to trace the development of some particular concept 
  out of Marxist theory through at least four of the writers we have read thus 
  far this semester. This may be any concept of your choosing -- such as ideology, 
  reification, commodification, base v. superstructure, etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">You must in your paper 
  set up a working definition of the concept and discuss its importance to Marxist 
  cultural analysis. You must further explore the similarities and differences 
  between the uses of this concept in the authors you cite -- how does the concept 
  change in importance or in focus over time? How does its meaning shift?</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I will be asking you for 
  some intermediate work toward this paper over the next couple of weeks; please 
  come talk to me as you begin focusing your ideas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Final details: Your paper 
  must be titled, must be in a hard-copy format, must be typed, double-spaced. 
  And it must use MLA format for citations. If you don't know MLA format, look 
  it up. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font></p>
