<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The Story So Far: </b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Four essays, divided 
    up among four group members (a,b,c,d) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Group discussion by 
    essay (all a's, all b's, etc.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Return to discussion 
    groups; share knowledge of each essay</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The Assignment for 
  Today:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Everyone should have 
    read the selections from Capital. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Plus, everyone should 
    have read a total of two other essays (one from the first assignment plus 
    one more, unless your first assignment was Capital, in which case you should 
    have read two more). </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> These other essays 
    were assigned by your discussion group, depending on its needs (so maybe everyone 
    read the same second essay, or maybe each essay got a second reading).</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Now:</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Spend 20 minutes in 
    your discussion groups, talking through the essays again, based on your new 
    reading knowledge. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Address the following 
    questions: </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> What is the central 
        argument of each of the four essays? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How are the four 
        essays connected? Specifically, which concepts seem to bind the four essays 
        together?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Each group should return 
    after 20 minutes with answers, as well as specific questions about any concepts 
    that need explaining. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Discussion: </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>From <i>The German Ideology:</i></b> 
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Ideology should be 
    based on "reality" and not on spiritual philosophy; can include abstractions, 
    but must begin with material (German philosophy tended to start with abstractions) 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The struggle is to 
    find the connection between the abstract and the material</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Man is responsible 
    for and capable of his own subsistence in the formulation of ideas, truths, 
    consciousness </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The evolution of production 
    and exchange represents our history best </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> History is retrojected 
    based on the ideologies that currently exist </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>From <i>The Eighteenth 
  Brumaire:</i> </b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The bourgeoisie cannot 
    be trusted; any successful revolution must be a proletariat-based revolution 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The petty-bourgeois 
    is a transitional class used by the bourgeois against the proletariat; tricked 
    into giving up their power </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Whenever revolution 
    happens, each involved group believes their mind-set is the right one; ideas 
    are overthrown as ruling classes are </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> When staging a revolution, 
    one shouldn't try to gain support of a more conservative group of individuals</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The aims of the revolutionary 
    individuals get diluted with each absorption into another group * Revolution 
    was much more about material concerns than ideology </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Merging of the landed 
    bourgeois and the capitalists </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>From <i>A Contribution 
  to the Critique of Political Economy:</i></b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Only rarely are political 
    groups capable of self-criticism; only they are capable of understanding the 
    political economies of earlier times </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> When applying abstract 
    concepts to other societies, must make sure they're not tainted with your 
    own contexts; political economists are guilty of this, imposing bourgeois 
    value systems on other types of economy (feudal, etc)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Criticizes other economists 
    for starting with the abstract and working down to the concrete; need to begin 
    with concrete </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>From <i>Capital:</i></b> 
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> People are commodified 
    by their labor; when they become commodities, they become exploitable </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> People become abstracted/alienated 
    by treating their labor as a commodity </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The reason for this 
    alienation is that the value of a commodity is determined by the amount of 
    labor that goes into it </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Anti-industrialization; 
    anti-mass-production </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Differentiates between 
    the quality and quantity of labor; capitalism does not </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Connections:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Starting with ideals 
    and moving to material is bad; must begin with material </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Human nature: fundamentally 
    negative; people need to be constrained; laissez-faire capitalism assumes 
    goodness </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Production of social 
    classes and production of culture are tied to economic production </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Interested in History 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Interested in disentangling 
    things that appear "natural" (ideology) from material reality </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Questions:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> What is a commodity?</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Objects' value are 
    determined by social reality, context </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Use value/exchange 
    value </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Use value: object 
        fulfills a need </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Exchange value: 
        value determined by trade </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Exchange value 
        is bad because it relies on a system in which all are consumers; reflects 
        the abstractions of this system</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> What does Marx make 
    of the family/women in a communist system? </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How much are Marx and 
    what we later understand as Marxism/communism really related?</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Commodity fetishism 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Reification </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>For next time: </b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Read the Gramsci selections 
    carefully, making notes of how familiar concepts get altered. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Skim the Luk‡cs essay, 
    looking for the overall argument. </font></li>
