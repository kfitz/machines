<ul>
  <li> Divide up into small groups; within groups, break into pairs.</li>
  <li> Each pair should exchange the brief writings you did for today; spend about 
    five to ten minutes reading and commenting, and then discuss in pairs for 
    another five to ten minutes. 
    <ul>
      <li> Note: if there are three of you, trade in a circle, and discuss together. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Then, no later than 3:05, return to your small groups.</li>
  <li> Discuss Baudrillard as an extension of Marxism: 
    <ul>
      <li> What is he doing to the Marxist project here?</li>
      <li> How is he contributing to it? </li>
      <li> How is he altering it? </li>
      <li> How is his agenda similar to or different from those of Williams and 
        Hall? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Also: collect questions to bring back to the large group. (3:20) </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Baudrillard: </b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Sign/signifier/signified/referent? 
    <ul>
      <li> Sign = signifier + signified (tree example)</li>
      <li> Sign ­ referent </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> B. criticizes M. for accepting forms of labor/production rather than critiquing 
    them; remains too much within capitalist/Western model </li>
  <li> B.'s background/historical situation?</li>
  <li> Relation to Althusser: mirror of production related to &quot;flipping the dialectic&quot;? 
  </li>
  <li> M.: evils of political economy come from exploitation of labor; B: evils 
    run deeper, &quot;general code of rational abstraction&quot; </li>
  <li> &quot;la parole&quot; (11) / la langue </li>
  <li> problem with code: determined by ruling class; hegemonic determination 
    of signs -- use value/exchange value </li>
  <li> reinvestment of meaning in signs through altering relationship between 
    signifier and signified </li>
  <li> ideology is grounded in the symbols of our social surroundings </li>
