<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Today:</b></font> </p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Divide up into four 
    groups by essay (all a's meet, all b's, etc.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Discuss your essay 
    with an eye toward understanding it well enough to return to your discussion 
    group and "teach" it to your peers. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Spend about 30 minutes 
    with your essay group, and then move into discussion groups. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In discussion groups, 
    introduce your essay to your group; spend 5 to 10 minutes outlining the argument 
    for them. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Begin to note connections 
    among the four essays as you talk. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Keep notes of specific 
    questions that you need to have answered, either by your peers or by me.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>For next time:</b> 
  </font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Everybody reads the 
    sections from Capital. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Each of you should 
    read one of the two remaining essays that you haven't yet read. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Those of you who've 
    already read the Capital essays should select two of the other three to read. 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Decide which essays 
    you're going to read in consultation with your group - you may decide that 
    all of you will focus on one of the essays that you understood least, or you 
    may switch off essays so that each one is read at least twice. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> We'll start class next 
    time in these small groups, talking for about fifteen or twenty minutes, after 
    which we'll spend some time talking as a full class about the four essays.</font></li>
