<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Course 
  Requirements and Grading</font> </h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Attendance and Participation:</b> 
  As our work here will revolve around discussion, your participation and preparedness 
  are indispensable, and will be graded. You will be permitted one unexcused absence; 
  each additional unexcused absence lowers your final grade one step. Moreover, 
  chronic late arrivals will not be tolerated; for every three late arrivals, 
  one unexcused absence will accrue. Counted within your A&P grade will be required 
  attendance at a number of lectures and panel discussions in the &quot;Representations: 
  Race/Technology/Culture&quot; series. Finally, be aware that presence without 
  preparedness does not count. Do the reading. <b>(15%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group Work:</b> During 
  the second week of classes, I will divide the class into groups of 4 students. 
  These working groups will serve multiple purposes during the semester: you will 
  do some in-class discussion in these groups, you will share the burden of reading 
  assignments within the groups, and you will work on group projects together. 
  Among these projects will be an in-class presentation requirement; on two occasions 
  this semester, your group will be called upon to lead our class discussion by 
  giving a brief presentation and directing the ensuing conversation. This presentation 
  and facilitation will be peer evaluated. Your overall work in the group will 
  be evaluated by the group's other members. More information to follow. <b>(25%)</b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Papers:</b> At the mid-point 
  of the semester, you will produce an 8-page paper in which you will carefully 
  consider some aspect of the theoretical discourse we have covered to that point. 
  The term paper, due at the end of the semester, will be 15 pages long, will 
  involve substantial research, and will make a complex, well-defined argument 
  in which you seek to apply the theoretical material we have covered to the cultural 
  phenomenon of your choosing. You will submit a proposal and an annotated bibliography 
  for this paper several weeks in advance of the paper itself; shortly before 
  the paper itself is due, you will submit a draft to a peer reviewer. All papers 
  must use proper MLA format. Late papers will only be accepted by prior arrangement. 
  Again, more details to follow. <b>(brief paper, 20%; term paper, 40%)</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>N.B.:</b> There are 
  currently no exams scheduled for this class. I reserve the right to change my 
  mind about this, however, if I feel an insufficient number of people are completing 
  the readings each week. Do your friends a favor: do the reading, talk in class, 
  and avoid a nasty final exam. </font></p>
