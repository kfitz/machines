<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>On Gramsci:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Relationship between 
    class conflict and revolution </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Marx understands 
        the dialectic as straight-forward and inexorable </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Gramsci suggests 
        that the conflict between classes may be revolutionary or reactionary 
        </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Role of intellectuals: 
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Marx sees as part 
        of bourgeoisie; doesn't really discuss</font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Gramsci sees the 
        intellectual as a potentially revolutionary force, when she breaks away 
        from the bureaucracy </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Bonapartism/Caesarism 
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> For Marx, Bonapartism 
        is a completely counter-revolutionary force; the way that the revolutionary 
        drives of the proletariat get undermined by the bourgeoisie </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> For Gramsci, Caesarism 
        is instead a compromise between the revolutionary and the reactionary; 
        the question is not how the Caesarist figure &quot;takes&quot; control, 
        but rather how the masses are led to consent to that control </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Fable of the beaver 
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In Marx, the proletariat 
        is wholly dominated by the capitalists, who ruthlessly seek to alienate 
        and destroy them </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In Gramsci, the 
        proletariat seem to inflict some measure of their own damage </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Hegemony and ideology 
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In Marx, the ruling 
        ideas are the ideas of the ruling class </font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In Gramsci, ideology 
        is a process, a constant struggle, in which the ruling class attempts 
        to maintain control, and the ruled attempt to subvert that control </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Benjamin</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Interplay between ownership 
    and access of art, information </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Advent of new technologies 
    creates a crisis for the proletariat; technology has the potential to liberate 
    culture from traditional values, but it also has the potential to enslave 
    the viewer into ideology </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Aura = authenticity, 
    cult value, ritual value, heavily based on inaccessibility to general public; 
    reproduction destroys the aura, turns art into consumer item</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Importance of seeing 
    art in &quot;natural habitat&quot;; change of location changes something about 
    art </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The more things are 
    reproduced, the more aura is destroyed, and the more the artist is separated 
    from his/her work </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Adorno & Horkheimer</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> People with the money 
    are in charge of dispersing ideas, do so with economic view in mind</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> proletariat being taught 
    how to think and act by the culture industry </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> resistance is &quot;incorporated&quot;; 
    conformity is necessary; deviation is gobbled up by higher powers; industry 
    creates or anticipates niche markets </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>For next time:</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Everybody read both of 
  the Althusser essays carefully. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Select, at least tentatively, 
  one of the concepts we've considered so far that you're interested in (such 
  as ideology, reification, hegemony, revolution, contradiction, etc.). Make notes 
  on the development of that concept in Althusser. Note particularly any differences 
  between the two essays in their treatment of the concept. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also, to continue this 
  work with Benjamin/Adorno & Horkheimer: decide which of these essays seems more 
  in line with the thinking of &quot;your&quot; position. We'll continue our debate 
  next time. </font></p>
