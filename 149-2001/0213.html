<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Divide up into 4 groups 
    by essay (all a's meet; all b's; etc.) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Discuss your essay 
    with an eye to understanding it well enough to return to your small groups 
    and &quot;teach&quot; it to your peers (about 20 minutes) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Return to small groups; 
    spend another 20 minutes outlining the major concepts of each essay and discussing 
    the following questions: </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Based on reading/discussing 
        these four essays, what do you now think Cultural Studies is?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> What does Cultural 
        Studies adopt from Marxism, as we've studied it to this point?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How does it depart 
        from or alter Marxism? </font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Each group should be 
    prepared to contribute answers to the large class discussion. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>What is Cultural Studies?</b> 
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Examines ways in which 
    social being determines consciousness; looking at ideology through a cultural 
    lens rather than a purely economic one </font></li>
  <li> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;Culture is the 
    sum of the available descriptions through which societies make sense of and 
    reflect their common experiences&quot; (Hall 59; quoting Williams) -- cultural 
    studies is the study of those available descriptions in order to determine 
    what the consciousness of those common experiences is </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> is there a problem 
    with &quot;societies&quot; here? How do &quot;societies&quot; make sense of 
    common experience? How are ideologies materialized through practice? </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> perhaps through political 
    and economic systems? All systems? (see ISAs -- examining all institutions 
    society establishes for itself)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> cultural studies as 
    the happy middle ground between culturalism and structuralism </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> applied cultural studies 
    is the critique of the hegemony of consciousness and the means of production 
    of that hegemony </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>What does it adopt from 
  Marxism?</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Idea that consciousness 
    is determined by material circumstances </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> No overarching ideal 
    controlling things; all referenced by context </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Educational system 
    perpetuates the current ideology </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Ideology is determined 
    by the dominant/oppressors</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Ways the dominant class 
    incorporates what has been successful for others (appropriation) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Ideological determinism 
    -- ideas have a way of coalescing from various dialectics of the past </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Process of hegemony 
    </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>What does it revise 
  or delete?</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Redefinition of determinism: 
    not linear causality, but rather an influence in setting limits </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As much emphasis placed 
    on other things as on the economic; interested in the &quot;totality&quot; 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Reprivileging of superstructure 
    in terms of its influence on the base </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Adding the notion of 
    race as a social construct </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Emphasis on process 
    of ideology formation in hegemony </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>For next time:</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Baudrillard's The Mirror 
  of Production -- read at a minimum the preface and introduction, the first chapter, 
  and the fifth chapter. Preferably, you should read the whole thing. Bring to 
  class next time a one-to-two page piece of writing on the theoretical concept 
  of your choice, both defining the concept and beginning to outline how different 
  writers deal with it. </font></p>
