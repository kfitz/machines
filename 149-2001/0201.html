</h3>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Today:</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In small groups: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Take two to three minutes 
    to make some notes for yourself about the major ideas that you have taken 
    from Gramsci </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Everyone shares those 
    ideas with the group </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As a group, select 
    one concept or idea that you feel interacts in an interesting way with either 
    the same or a similar concept from the Marx/Engels essays </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Find a specific passage 
    in Gramsci that deals specifically with that concept or idea </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Prepare a comparison 
    between Gramsci's treatment of this concept, with specific reference to this 
    passage, and Marx's treatment of it </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Each group will present 
    their concept/passage/comparison in a relatively formal way, so be prepared 
    </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 1:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Caesarism -- conflict 
    between two groups (A&B) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Marx sees class conflict 
    as way revolution occurs </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> P. 219: three possibilities 
    (A wins; B wins; neither wins, but third force [C] intervenes, and A and B 
    dissolve into one another) </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Marx sees this in general 
    sense: sooner or later there will be synthesis from conflict; Gramsci sees 
    more specifically: conflict may be revolutionary or reactionary </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Gramsci: one group 
    defeats another as random process; for Marx, more of a definite pattern of 
    progress </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 2:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> G: before intellectuals 
    were part of bureaucracy; now breaking away; M: didn't really discuss intellectuals; 
    saw as part of bourgeoisie </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> P. 244: people have 
    been condensed into science -- sarcasm; how we have intellectualized social 
    science as a study of a surrounding society and not necessarily the people 
    in it </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 3:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> How the ruling classes 
    use the middle classes' aspirations against them </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">P. 210: reabsorption 
    of control by ruling class </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Expands on 18th Brumaire; 
    both abstracts and makes more specific by talking about the methodology of 
    how the ruling class rules, keeping bureaucracy in mind </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">P. 225: ruling class 
    as bureaucracy; ruling class as body -- even harder to extricate from</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 4:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">P. 244-5: people condensed 
    into science </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Metaphor of science 
    for development of human history </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Is it arbitrary or 
    rational? </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> M: science as one of 
    tools of ruling class; G: is that necessarily a bad thing? </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> G suggests that science 
    transcends Marx's capitalism; might be more to it</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 5:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> P. 276: rift between 
    popular masses and ruling ideologies </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Fusion of classes needs 
    to take place instead of just one group taking over; needs to be consensus, 
    cohesion of classes </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Intellectuals breaking 
    away: M gives no attention to middle; G calling for coherent social group 
    to steer attention away from bourgeoisie, not just proletariat </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> P. 219: reciprocal 
    destruction -- opposition between two groups so strong that there can be no 
    synthesis resulting from contradiction </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Seems more cautious; 
    need to have ideological goals before jumping into revolution. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 6:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Caesarism: p. 219 connected 
    to 18th Brumaire; struggle between petty bourgeois and proletariat reflected 
    in Caesarism </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> See Group 1 </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Gramsci's view of reactionary 
    is reflected in 18th Brumaire </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 7:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Caesarism, A, B, C 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> P. 222: no passage 
    from one type of state to another; evolution</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Departure from M's 
    revolution </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Revolution may not 
    be effective; may be futile or detrimental </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Fable of the beaver: 
    self-evolution by avoiding conflict by radical self-alterations; means of 
    keeping political dignity; group works to change itself from within </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Hard to tell whether 
    G. advocates the evolution or sees it as necessarily compromise (castration 
    v. death)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Revolution is very 
    much a political idea; but political equality cannot exist without economic 
    equality -- sees revolution as seeking equality rather than political upheaval</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 8:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Fable of the beaver 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> P. 258: the ethical 
    state; ruling classes will only help lower classes as much as they'll help 
    themselves </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Ethical state will 
    bring people to a certain level, but done in order to increase the forces 
    of development, which technically favors the ruling class interest; connects 
    to M's &quot;ruling ideas of time are ideas of ruling class&quot; </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Fake moralism; superficial 
    helping out without betraying their own interests </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Distinction between 
    ethical and political state -- sees in eternal contradiction; perhaps true 
    ethical state can't really exist </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> What does the &quot;political 
    state&quot; mean? </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Group 9:</b> </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Fable of beaver: very 
    horrifying! Beaver = lower class; to survive, must self-mutilate; beaver is 
    nothing to hunters but chemicals; must eliminate its manhood in order to survive</font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Analogy to commodification/reification 
    of proletariat labor; workers become only their labor instead of fully human 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> G goes on to explore 
    why there way no defense; relates to M. in thinking about how exploited classes 
    will go along with exploitation</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>For next time:</b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Everybody read both the 
  Benjamin and the Adorno and Horkheimer essays carefully -- especially if you've 
  read them before in another class. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Contemplate: </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The two arguments being 
    made -- where do they coincide? How do they diverge? </font></li>
  <li><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> If you've read these 
    before, how has your understanding of them changed, given the other readings 
    and conversations we've had so far this semester? </font></li>
</ul>
