  Description</font></h3>
<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This course will focus 
  on the ways that Marxist social thought underwrites its recent descendant, Cultural 
  Studies, and the ways that it can inform the study of the contemporary media. 
  To this end, we'll read Marx and his many followers, as well as more contemporary 
  revisions of Marxist thought. We'll also read a number of critical applications 
  of Marxist theory to various forms of cultural production. The course will be 
  driven by concerns raised by student interest -- the goal is not simply that 
  you emerge understanding more about Marxism and its role in cultural analysis, 
  but also that you take an active role in <i>thinking</i> this critical method. 
  Therefore, the class will be focused around group projects, student presentations, 
  and discussion; lectures will be available, but only in response to specific 
  questions and concerns. </font> </p>
